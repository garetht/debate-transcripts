{"metadata": {"first_debater_correct": false, "question_idx": 17, "background_text": "Diamonds in the Rough \n\n         Fourscore and seven years ago, the first steel and concrete baseball palace opened for business. Philadelphia's Shibe Park, home to the Athletics and later the Phillies, was one of 13 urban ballparks built in the seven-year period now regarded as the golden age of ballpark architecture. All but three (Wrigley Field, Fenway Park, and Tiger Stadium) have since been razed. \n\n          Replacing parks built of wood, these ballyards set new standards for size, fire safety, intimacy, and convenience. As places to watch ballgames, they were vastly superior to the post-World War II parks, especially the facilities designed in the late '60s and '70s that doubled as football stadiums. But these concrete monsters, plopped into vast parking lots in Houston, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, and elsewhere, lack the character of the classic parks. \n\n         Chicago's New Comiskey Park, which opened in 1991, attempted to address the character question with a superficial postmodern facade that in some ways resembled the exterior of the golden-era park it replaced. New Comiskey was marketed as an old-fashioned park with all the modern conveniences. But inside, it was still a symmetrical concrete monster, and it sat in the middle of a 7,000-car parking lot rather than in an urban neighborhood. \n\n         A year later, a new--yet more genuinely old--ballpark arrived to dispel the gloom. Baltimore's Oriole Park at Camden Yards revived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical, relatively intimate, steel-structured, city-friendly ballpark. \"Once this opens,\" predicted Commissioner of Baseball Bart Giamatti, \"everyone will want one like it.\" And so it came to be: Camden Yards' successors in Cleveland, Arlington (Texas), and Denver, and those designed for Milwaukee, Seattle, and San Francisco, take their cues from Baltimore's conceptual breakthrough. Even totally nontraditional parks, like those in Phoenix, Miami, and Tampa Bay, emulate the asymmetry of the Camden Yards outfield. It's almost as though a disembodied voice intoned, \"If you build it, they will copy.\" \n\n         While Camden Yards and its offspring are almost universally praised, some of them don't deserve the hype. The most annoying hype is that all the new parks are intimate, and that every seat is better at the new place than the old. Intimacy has two aspects--actual size and the subjective perception of size and scale. A good architect can ace the second part of the test through convincing forms, good proportions, and attractive materials. The exposed steelwork, brick, stone, tile, and well-placed wall openings of the new parks beat the cold and sterile stadiums of a generation ago. \n\n         For the new parks' charms, we should be thankful. But in actual size, the new ballyards are not intimate. All their amenities--elevators, wider concourses, abundant toilets (especially for women), bathrooms, escalators, plentiful food stands, and luxury suites--make them far larger than the parks they claim to emulate. These parks are larger than even the multipurpose hulks we all love to hate. Compare, for instance, the spanking new Ballpark at Arlington (49,100 seats), which rests on 13.6 acres, to Seattle's Kingdome, a 58,000-seat multipurpose stadium that opened in 1976 and covers 9.3 acres. (Ebbets Field, home to the Brooklyn Dodgers, occupied a mere 5.7 acres and seated 32,000.) \n\n         Or compare heights: New Comiskey Park's roof is 146 feet above field level; old Comiskey Park was about 75 feet high. This is not ballpark trivia, but an indicator of fan experience: Upper-deck seats in the new, taller stadiums are farther away from the action. At Arlington, the fan sitting in the middle-row, upper-deck seat closest to home plate is 224 feet from the batter, compared to 125 feet at Tiger Stadium, a park with 4,300 more seats. \n\n         Why are upper-deck seats in the new parks so far from the game? Two reasons: column placement and luxury seating. \n\n         In the old parks, the structural columns stood within the seating areas, placing the upper-deck seats closer to the game. The trade-off was that these columns obstructed the view of some fans. Today's architects \"remedy\" the problem by placing the columns behind the seating areas, thus moving the upper decks back from the field. (It should be noted that the new parks' claim that they have no impaired-view seats is an overstatement.) \n\n         Added tiers devoted to luxury seating at the new parks also push the upper deck away from the field. The retreat of that deck is a century-long process, but it can be stemmed. The Orioles pressed for several design changes that lowered Camden Yards' top deck and produced a middle-row viewing distance of 199 feet, about eight rows closer than Arlington's. \n\n         Design references to golden-age ballparks are only one parallel between that period and ours. We are also matching that era's frenzied pace of construction: Twenty-six of Major League Baseball's 32 franchises occupy a park that is less than 10 years old; has been, or will be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move into a new one soon. \n\n         One of the classic parks' merits was that they were unsubsidized. Team owners bought land and paid for stadium construction--some even built trolley lines to transport fans to the games. In all but two cases during the last 65 years, taxpayers have covered most or all of the costs of stadium building. \n\n         The San Francisco Giants are planning a similar arrangement for their bayfront stadium, assembling about $240 million in private funds and persuading the city to pay for some of the infrastructure. The Giants say that other team owners are rooting against their scheme, because it calls into question the profligate public subsidies. Some of the subsidies exceed capital and maintenance costs: If the White Sox fail to draw 1.5 million annual fans at New Comiskey Park in the 11th through 20th years of their lease, the state of Illinois is contractually obliged to cover the shortfall at the gate by buying upto 300,000 tickets. \n\n         You'd expect that the public would get something, perhaps affordable seats, in return for subsidizing stadiums. Instead, the cheap seats in the new parks are scarcer. The Seattle Mariners' proposed park, for instance, will contain about one-fourth as many general-admission seats as the present location. This erosion of low-cost seats is a long-running trend. \n\n         So too is the dramatic increase in luxury seating, which is the primary real reason for the ballpark-building boom. The real gold mines are the posh luxury suites that lease for between $30,000 and $200,000 a year (payable in advance). A comparable moneymaker is the club deck, just above the first-tier seating. These pricey sections are occupied usually on a season-ticket basis, and offer the best sightlines, roomier seats, and wait staff who peddle gourmet fare. \n\n         The gilding doesn't end there: New parks also include members-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants. \n\n          Naturally, owners don't advertise their new parks as a means of making life better for elite ticketholders. They say that only a new stadium will allow them to make enough money to stay in town or to field a competitive team and to allow fans to savor that old-time baseball flavor in greater comfort and convenience. Local taxpayers tend to lay off this pitch--they have voted these measures down in Illinois, Washington state, California, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Politically savvy owners usually bypass the voters and tap state governments directly for the money. \n\n         Larger and more lavish stadiums translate into greater land and construction costs. Operable roofs, such as those in Toronto's SkyDome, Phoenix's BankOne Ballpark, and those proposed for Seattle and Milwaukee, are budget-busters. Since most teams put up little (if any) of their own money, they have scant incentive to economize on the parks. In Seattle, Mariner management has demanded an operable roof even though the city has the driest weather in MLB outside California. The real problem with the Seattle climate is cold weather in spring and fall, but the unsealed roof won't make the park warmer or totally free of wind. \n\n         Lately, the cost of stadiums has ranged from about $300 million to $500 million. The multipurpose stadium that the Yankees want built on Manhattan's lower west side tentatively carries a $1 billion price tag. Add the financing and maintenance costs, and even a midpriced project goes through the retractable roof. At one point, the cost of the Brewers' proposed stadium grew from $250 million to $845 million, and that's not counting the value of the land. \n\n         The good news is that not every owner is demanding a castle for his team. All Pittsburgh Pirates owner Kevin McClatchy wants is a \"35,000-to-37,000-seat park with natural grass and no roof, bells, or whistles.\" Though his attitude is commendable, the proposed park will still cost about $200 million, and perhaps an equal amount in interest. \n\n         Why should the public chip in? Taxpayer subsidies don't produce cheaper tickets--they produce more expensive tickets. The average admission price (not counting club seats and suites) rises about 35 percent when a team moves into new digs. And independent economists (i.e., those not hired by stadium proponents) discount the claim that new stadiums spur regional economic growth. \n\n         But one compelling argument for subsidies is that new stadiums can pull their cities together when properly designed and sited. This requires a downtown or neighborhood location where lots of fans can take the bus or the train to the game; where they can walk to the stadium from work, hotels, restaurants, or bars; and where getting to the game is a communal event that is part of a broader urban experience. This is the case with older parks such as Wrigley Field and Fenway Park, and the new ones in Toronto, Baltimore, Cleveland, and Denver. \n\n         \"If you put them in the wrong place, it's a colossal waste of money,\" says the planning director of the city of Cleveland. \"But if you put them in the right place, the benefits are phenomenal,\" \n\n         Recent attendance patterns show that urban parks generate much better patronage than suburban ones or those in neither/nor locations. There are also strong indicators that suggest new urban parks have \"legs,\" retaining more of their patrons after the novelty wears off. But some teams deliberately seek isolated locations, where they can better monopolize parking revenues and game-related food, drink, and souvenir business. This is why the White Sox moated their park with 100 acres of parking, why the Milwaukee Brewers refuse to build downtown, and why the Mariners insisted on the most remote of Seattle's three ballpark-siting options. \n\n         Modern conveniences aside, the new baseball shrines are a mixed bag. Most are visually impressive, boast interestingly shaped playing fields, and start off as box-office hits. But too many of them are large and expensive, tend to live on the dole, and are hampered by seat layouts that create a caste system among fans. At their best, they strengthen their cities; at their worst, they exploit them. \n\n         The decision-making process behind the financing and building of new ballparks has become predictable, as have the designs. But the good news is that our stadium boom is far from over. If owners and public agencies can be persuaded to take a longer view of stadium economics and community concerns, we may yet see parks that better unite traditional character with modern convenience.\n", "question": "What are some of the design features that the author highlights as beneficial about the new park designs?", "first_debater_answer": "There is a greater diversity of dining", "second_debater_answer": "The fields have new shapes", "debate_identifier": "Diamonds in the Rough_What are some of the design features that the author highlights as beneficial about the new park designs?"}, "speeches": [{"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "The following are rules from the game of Debate.\n- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_A, Debater_B) and a Judge.

Instead, the cheap seats in the new parks are scarcer. The Seattle Mariners' proposed park, for instance, will contain about one-fourth as many general-admission seats as the present location. This erosion of low-cost seats is a long-running trend. \n\n         So too is the dramatic increase in luxury seating, which is the primary real reason for the ballpark-building boom. The real gold mines are the posh luxury suites that lease for between $30,000 and $200,000 a year (payable in advance). A comparable moneymaker is the club deck, just above the first-tier seating. These pricey sections are occupied usually on a season-ticket basis, and offer the best sightlines, roomier seats, and wait staff who peddle gourmet fare. \n\n         The gilding doesn't end there: New parks also include members-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants. \n\n          Naturally, owners don't advertise their new parks as a means of making life better for elite ticketholders.

Local taxpayers tend to lay off this pitch--they have voted these measures down in Illinois, Washington state, California, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Politically savvy owners usually bypass the voters and tap state governments directly for the money. \n\n         Larger and more lavish stadiums translate into greater land and construction costs. Operable roofs, such as those in Toronto's SkyDome, Phoenix's BankOne Ballpark, and those proposed for Seattle and Milwaukee, are budget-busters.

All Pittsburgh Pirates owner Kevin McClatchy wants is a \"35,000-to-37,000-seat park with natural grass and no roof, bells, or whistles.\" Though his attitude is commendable, the proposed park will still cost about $200 million, and perhaps an equal amount in interest. \n\n         Why should the public chip in?

Philadelphia's Shibe Park, home to the Athletics and later the Phillies, was one of 13 urban ballparks built in the seven-year period now regarded as the golden age of ballpark architecture. All but three (Wrigley Field, Fenway Park, and Tiger Stadium) have since been razed. \n\n          Replacing parks built of wood, these ballyards set new standards for size, fire safety, intimacy, and convenience. As places to watch ballgames, they were vastly superior to the post-World War II parks, especially the facilities designed in the late '60s and '70s that doubled as football stadiums. But these concrete monsters, plopped into vast parking lots in Houston, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, and elsewhere, lack the character of the classic parks. \n\n         Chicago's New Comiskey Park, which opened in 1991, attempted to address the character question with a superficial postmodern facade that in some ways resembled the exterior of the golden-era park it replaced. New Comiskey was marketed as an old-fashioned park with all the modern conveniences. But inside, it was still a symmetrical concrete monster, and it sat in the middle of a 7,000-car parking lot rather than in an urban neighborhood. \n\n         A year later, a new--yet more genuinely old--ballpark arrived to dispel the gloom. Baltimore's Oriole Park at Camden Yards revived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical, relatively intimate, steel-structured, city-friendly ballpark. \"Once this opens,\" predicted Commissioner of Baseball Bart Giamatti, \"everyone will want one like it.\" And so it came to be: Camden Yards' successors in Cleveland, Arlington (Texas), and Denver, and those designed for Milwaukee, Seattle, and San Francisco, take their cues from Baltimore's conceptual breakthrough. Even totally nontraditional parks, like those in Phoenix, Miami, and Tampa Bay, emulate the asymmetry of the Camden Yards outfield. It's almost as though a disembodied voice intoned, \"If you build it, they will copy.\" \n\n         While Camden Yards and its offspring are almost universally praised, some of them don't deserve the hype. The most annoying hype is that all the new parks are intimate, and that every seat is better at the new place than the old. Intimacy has two aspects--actual size and the subjective perception of size and scale. A good architect can ace the second part of the test through convincing forms, good proportions, and attractive materials. The exposed steelwork, brick, stone, tile, and well-placed wall openings of the new parks beat the cold and sterile stadiums of a generation ago. \n\n         For the new parks' charms, we should be thankful. But in actual size, the new ballyards are not intimate. All their amenities--elevators, wider concourses, abundant toilets (especially for women), bathrooms, escalators, plentiful food stands, and luxury suites--make them far larger than the parks they claim to emulate. These parks are larger than even the multipurpose hulks we all love to hate. Compare, for instance, the spanking new Ballpark at Arlington (49,100 seats), which rests on 13.6 acres, to Seattle's Kingdome, a 58,000-seat multipurpose stadium that opened in 1976 and covers 9.3 acres. (Ebbets Field, home to the Brooklyn Dodgers, occupied a mere 5.7 acres and seated 32,000.) \n\n         Or compare heights: New Comiskey Park's roof is 146 feet above field level; old Comiskey Park was about 75 feet high. This is not ballpark trivia, but an indicator of fan experience: Upper-deck seats in the new, taller stadiums are farther away from the action. At Arlington, the fan sitting in the middle-row, upper-deck seat closest to home plate is 224 feet from the batter, compared to 125 feet at Tiger Stadium, a park with 4,300 more seats. \n\n         Why are upper-deck seats in the new parks so far from the game? Two reasons: column placement and luxury seating. \n\n         In the old parks, the structural columns stood within the seating areas, placing the upper-deck seats closer to the game. The trade-off was that these columns obstructed the view of some fans. Today's architects \"remedy\" the problem by placing the columns behind the seating areas, thus moving the upper decks back from the field. (It should be noted that the new parks' claim that they have no impaired-view seats is an overstatement.) \n\n         Added tiers devoted to luxury seating at the new parks also push the upper deck away from the field. The retreat of that deck is a century-long process, but it can be stemmed. The Orioles pressed for several design changes that lowered Camden Yards' top deck and produced a middle-row viewing distance of 199 feet, about eight rows closer than Arlington's. \n\n         Design references to golden-age ballparks are only one parallel between that period and ours. We are also matching that era's frenzied pace of construction: Twenty-six of Major League Baseball's 32 franchises occupy a park that is less than 10 years old; has been, or will be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move into a new one soon. \n\n         One of the classic parks' merits was that they were unsubsidized. Team owners bought land and paid for stadium construction--some even built trolley lines to transport fans to the games. In all but two cases during the last 65 years, taxpayers have covered most or all of the costs of stadium building. \n\n         The San Francisco Giants are planning a similar arrangement for their bayfront stadium, assembling about $240 million in private funds and persuading the city to pay for some of the infrastructure. The Giants say that other team owners are rooting against their scheme, because it calls into question the profligate public subsidies. Some of the subsidies exceed capital and maintenance costs: If the White Sox fail to draw 1.5 million annual fans at New Comiskey Park in the 11th through 20th years of their lease, the state of Illinois is contractually obliged to cover the shortfall at the gate by buying upto 300,000 tickets. \n\n         You'd expect that the public would get something, perhaps affordable seats, in return for subsidizing stadiums. Instead, the cheap seats in the new parks are scarcer. The Seattle Mariners' proposed park, for instance, will contain about one-fourth as many general-admission seats as the present location. This erosion of low-cost seats is a long-running trend. \n\n         So too is the dramatic increase in luxury seating, which is the primary real reason for the ballpark-building boom. The real gold mines are the posh luxury suites that lease for between $30,000 and $200,000 a year (payable in advance). A comparable moneymaker is the club deck, just above the first-tier seating. These pricey sections are occupied usually on a season-ticket basis, and offer the best sightlines, roomier seats, and wait staff who peddle gourmet fare. \n\n         The gilding doesn't end there: New parks also include members-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants. \n\n          Naturally, owners don't advertise their new parks as a means of making life better for elite ticketholders. They say that only a new stadium will allow them to make enough money to stay in town or to field a competitive team and to allow fans to savor that old-time baseball flavor in greater comfort and convenience. Local taxpayers tend to lay off this pitch--they have voted these measures down in Illinois, Washington state, California, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Politically savvy owners usually bypass the voters and tap state governments directly for the money. \n\n         Larger and more lavish stadiums translate into greater land and construction costs. Operable roofs, such as those in Toronto's SkyDome, Phoenix's BankOne Ballpark, and those proposed for Seattle and Milwaukee, are budget-busters. Since most teams put up little (if any) of their own money, they have scant incentive to economize on the parks. In Seattle, Mariner management has demanded an operable roof even though the city has the driest weather in MLB outside California.

Philadelphia's Shibe Park, home to the Athletics and later the Phillies, was one of 13 urban ballparks built in the seven-year period now regarded as the golden age of ballpark architecture. All but three (Wrigley Field, Fenway Park, and Tiger Stadium) have since been razed. \n\n          Replacing parks built of wood, these ballyards set new standards for size, fire safety, intimacy, and convenience. As places to watch ballgames, they were vastly superior to the post-World War II parks, especially the facilities designed in the late '60s and '70s that doubled as football stadiums. But these concrete monsters, plopped into vast parking lots in Houston, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, and elsewhere, lack the character of the classic parks. \n\n         Chicago's New Comiskey Park, which opened in 1991, attempted to address the character question with a superficial postmodern facade that in some ways resembled the exterior of the golden-era park it replaced. New Comiskey was marketed as an old-fashioned park with all the modern conveniences. But inside, it was still a symmetrical concrete monster, and it sat in the middle of a 7,000-car parking lot rather than in an urban neighborhood. \n\n         A year later, a new--yet more genuinely old--ballpark arrived to dispel the gloom. Baltimore's Oriole Park at Camden Yards revived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical, relatively intimate, steel-structured, city-friendly ballpark. \"Once this opens,\" predicted Commissioner of Baseball Bart Giamatti, \"everyone will want one like it.\" And so it came to be: Camden Yards' successors in Cleveland, Arlington (Texas), and Denver, and those designed for Milwaukee, Seattle, and San Francisco, take their cues from Baltimore's conceptual breakthrough. Even totally nontraditional parks, like those in Phoenix, Miami, and Tampa Bay, emulate the asymmetry of the Camden Yards outfield. It's almost as though a disembodied voice intoned, \"If you build it, they will copy.\" \n\n         While Camden Yards and its offspring are almost universally praised, some of them don't deserve the hype. The most annoying hype is that all the new parks are intimate, and that every seat is better at the new place than the old. Intimacy has two aspects--actual size and the subjective perception of size and scale. A good architect can ace the second part of the test through convincing forms, good proportions, and attractive materials. The exposed steelwork, brick, stone, tile, and well-placed wall openings of the new parks beat the cold and sterile stadiums of a generation ago. \n\n         For the new parks' charms, we should be thankful. But in actual size, the new ballyards are not intimate. All their amenities--elevators, wider concourses, abundant toilets (especially for women), bathrooms, escalators, plentiful food stands, and luxury suites--make them far larger than the parks they claim to emulate. These parks are larger than even the multipurpose hulks we all love to hate. Compare, for instance, the spanking new Ballpark at Arlington (49,100 seats), which rests on 13.6 acres, to Seattle's Kingdome, a 58,000-seat multipurpose stadium that opened in 1976 and covers 9.3 acres. (Ebbets Field, home to the Brooklyn Dodgers, occupied a mere 5.7 acres and seated 32,000.) \n\n         Or compare heights: New Comiskey Park's roof is 146 feet above field level; old Comiskey Park was about 75 feet high. This is not ballpark trivia, but an indicator of fan experience: Upper-deck seats in the new, taller stadiums are farther away from the action. At Arlington, the fan sitting in the middle-row, upper-deck seat closest to home plate is 224 feet from the batter, compared to 125 feet at Tiger Stadium, a park with 4,300 more seats. \n\n         Why are upper-deck seats in the new parks so far from the game? Two reasons: column placement and luxury seating. \n\n         In the old parks, the structural columns stood within the seating areas, placing the upper-deck seats closer to the game. The trade-off was that these columns obstructed the view of some fans. Today's architects \"remedy\" the problem by placing the columns behind the seating areas, thus moving the upper decks back from the field. (It should be noted that the new parks' claim that they have no impaired-view seats is an overstatement.) \n\n         Added tiers devoted to luxury seating at the new parks also push the upper deck away from the field. The retreat of that deck is a century-long process, but it can be stemmed. The Orioles pressed for several design changes that lowered Camden Yards' top deck and produced a middle-row viewing distance of 199 feet, about eight rows closer than Arlington's. \n\n         Design references to golden-age ballparks are only one parallel between that period and ours. We are also matching that era's frenzied pace of construction: Twenty-six of Major League Baseball's 32 franchises occupy a park that is less than 10 years old; has been, or will be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move into a new one soon. \n\n         One of the classic parks' merits was that they were unsubsidized. Team owners bought land and paid for stadium construction--some even built trolley lines to transport fans to the games. In all but two cases during the last 65 years, taxpayers have covered most or all of the costs of stadium building. \n\n         The San Francisco Giants are planning a similar arrangement for their bayfront stadium, assembling about $240 million in private funds and persuading the city to pay for some of the infrastructure. The Giants say that other team owners are rooting against their scheme, because it calls into question the profligate public subsidies. Some of the subsidies exceed capital and maintenance costs: If the White Sox fail to draw 1.5 million annual fans at New Comiskey Park in the 11th through 20th years of their lease, the state of Illinois is contractually obliged to cover the shortfall at the gate by buying upto 300,000 tickets. \n\n         You'd expect that the public would get something, perhaps affordable seats, in return for subsidizing stadiums. Instead, the cheap seats in the new parks are scarcer. The Seattle Mariners' proposed park, for instance, will contain about one-fourth as many general-admission seats as the present location. This erosion of low-cost seats is a long-running trend. \n\n         So too is the dramatic increase in luxury seating, which is the primary real reason for the ballpark-building boom. The real gold mines are the posh luxury suites that lease for between $30,000 and $200,000 a year (payable in advance). A comparable moneymaker is the club deck, just above the first-tier seating. These pricey sections are occupied usually on a season-ticket basis, and offer the best sightlines, roomier seats, and wait staff who peddle gourmet fare. \n\n         The gilding doesn't end there: New parks also include members-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants. \n\n          Naturally, owners don't advertise their new parks as a means of making life better for elite ticketholders. They say that only a new stadium will allow them to make enough money to stay in town or to field a competitive team and to allow fans to savor that old-time baseball flavor in greater comfort and convenience. Local taxpayers tend to lay off this pitch--they have voted these measures down in Illinois, Washington state, California, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Politically savvy owners usually bypass the voters and tap state governments directly for the money. \n\n         Larger and more lavish stadiums translate into greater land and construction costs. Operable roofs, such as those in Toronto's SkyDome, Phoenix's BankOne Ballpark, and those proposed for Seattle and Milwaukee, are budget-busters. Since most teams put up little (if any) of their own money, they have scant incentive to economize on the parks. In Seattle, Mariner management has demanded an operable roof even though the city has the driest weather in MLB outside California. The real problem with the Seattle climate is cold weather in spring and fall, but the unsealed roof won't make the park warmer or totally free of wind. \n\n         Lately, the cost of stadiums has ranged from about $300 million to $500 million. The multipurpose stadium that the Yankees want built on Manhattan's lower west side tentatively carries a $1 billion price tag. Add the financing and maintenance costs, and even a midpriced project goes through the retractable roof. At one point, the cost of the Brewers' proposed stadium grew from $250 million to $845 million, and that's not counting the value of the land. \n\n         The good news is that not every owner is demanding a castle for his team. All Pittsburgh Pirates owner Kevin McClatchy wants is a \"35,000-to-37,000-seat park with natural grass and no roof, bells, or whistles.\" Though his attitude is commendable, the proposed park will still cost about $200 million, and perhaps an equal amount in interest. \n\n         Why should the public chip in? Taxpayer subsidies don't produce cheaper tickets--they produce more expensive tickets. The average admission price (not counting club seats and suites) rises about 35 percent when a team moves into new digs. And independent economists (i.e., those not hired by stadium proponents) discount the claim that new stadiums spur regional economic growth. \n\n         But one compelling argument for subsidies is that new stadiums can pull their cities together when properly designed and sited. This requires a downtown or neighborhood location where lots of fans can take the bus or the train to the game; where they can walk to the stadium from work, hotels, restaurants, or bars; and where getting to the game is a communal event that is part of a broader urban experience. This is the case with older parks such as Wrigley Field and Fenway Park, and the new ones in Toronto, Baltimore, Cleveland, and Denver. \n\n         \"If you put them in the wrong place, it's a colossal waste of money,\" says the planning director of the city of Cleveland. \"But if you put them in the right place, the benefits are phenomenal,\" \n\n         Recent attendance patterns show that urban parks generate much better patronage than suburban ones or those in neither/nor locations. There are also strong indicators that suggest new urban parks have \"legs,\" retaining more of their patrons after the novelty wears off. But some teams deliberately seek isolated locations, where they can better monopolize parking revenues and game-related food, drink, and souvenir business. This is why the White Sox moated their park with 100 acres of parking, why the Milwaukee Brewers refuse to build downtown, and why the Mariners insisted on the most remote of Seattle's three ballpark-siting options. \n\n         Modern conveniences aside, the new baseball shrines are a mixed bag. Most are visually impressive, boast interestingly shaped playing fields, and start off as box-office hits. But too many of them are large and expensive, tend to live on the dole, and are hampered by seat layouts that create a caste system among fans. At their best, they strengthen their cities; at their worst, they exploit them. \n\n         The decision-making process behind the financing and building of new ballparks has become predictable, as have the designs. But the good news is that our stadium boom is far from over. If owners and public agencies can be persuaded to take a longer view of stadium economics and community concerns, we may yet see parks that better unite traditional character with modern convenience.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat are some of the design features that the author highlights as beneficial about the new park designs?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The fields have new shapes\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"There is a greater diversity of dining\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"There is a greater diversity of dining\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cGreater Diversity of Dining\u201d as a Key Beneficial Design Feature  \n\n1.

Field asymmetry is largely aesthetic and derivative, lacking the direct impact on fan comfort, urban integration, and stadium financing that diverse dining provides.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cThe fields have new shapes\u201d\n\n1. Primary textual emphasis on asymmetry  \n  a. <quote> Baltimore's Oriole Park at Camden Yards revived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical, relatively intimate, steel-structured, city-friendly ballpark.</quote>  \n     \u2013 The author singles out \u201cquirkily asymmetrical\u201d playing fields as the conceptual breakthrough spurring an entire generation of new parks.  If \u201cnew shapes\u201d were unimportant, this asymmetry would not be highlighted as the very feature \u201ceveryone will want.\u201d  \n  b. Successors \u201ctake their cues from Baltimore\u2019s conceptual breakthrough\u201d and \u201cemulate the asymmetry of the Camden Yards outfield.\u201d  \n     \u2013 Multiple citations of copying asymmetry confirm that field shape is both distinctive and beneficial.  \n\n2. Intimacy and subjective perception reinforced by field design  \n  a. The author contrasts \u201ccold and sterile stadiums\u201d with new parks\u2019 \u201cconvincing forms, good proportions\u201d \u2013 which refers chiefly to nonstandard field configurations in tandem with fa\u00e7ade materials.  \n  b. Asymmetrical fields create visual interest and enhance the \u201csubjective perception of size and scale,\u201d supporting the author\u2019s definition of \u201cintimacy.\u201d  \n\n3. \u201cInterestingly shaped playing fields\u201d explicitly praised  \n  a. <quote> Modern conveniences aside, the new baseball shrines are a mixed bag. Most are visually impressive, boast interestingly shaped playing fields, and start off as box-office hits. </quote>  \n     \u2013 The author immediately pairs \u201cinteresting\u201d field shapes with the parks\u2019 box-office success, underscoring shape as a beneficial design feature.  \n\n4. Field shape supports urban integration and \u201cleg\u201d retention  \n  a. Urban parks with distinct shapes keep fans returning \u201cafter the novelty wears off.\u201d A novel, asymmetrical design is part of the communal urban experience the author deems \u201cphenomenal.\u201d  \n  b. By contrast, multipurpose, symmetrical stadiums fail to generate \u201cmuch better patronage.\u201d  \n\nRebuttal of \u201cdiverse dining\u201d (Debater_A)  \n1. Peripheral to design goals  \n  a. The author lists \u201cplentiful food stands\u201d among size-inflating amenities that make parks \u201cfar larger than even the multipurpose hulks.\u201d These amenities are noted as a downside, not a virtue.  \n  b. Emphasis throughout is on field shape and siting for communal urban benefits, not on culinary variety.  \n\n2. Luxury tiers and clubs create a caste system  \n  a. \u201cLuxury suites,\u201d \u201cclub decks,\u201d and \u201cmembers-only stadium clubs\u201d are criticized as exclusionary and profit-driven. Dining and bars serve these exclusive areas, contributing to the author\u2019s complaint about \u201ccaste system among fans.\u201d  \n  b. The author laments that subsidized stadiums \u201cproduce more expensive tickets\u201d and erode cheap seats. Dining diversity does not mitigate these harms; it often drives up costs.  \n\n3. Lack of textual support for \u201cdiversity of dining\u201d as a benefit  \n  a. The word \u201cdiversity\u201d does not appear; the author never cites food variety as a motivating factor for copying design.  \n  b. By contrast, the asymmetry and \u201cinteresting shapes\u201d are repeatedly lauded and explicitly credited with parks\u2019 success.  \n\nConclusion  \nOnly \u201cnew, asymmetrical, interestingly shaped playing fields\u201d are consistently praised in the text as both architecturally innovative and commercially successful. Dining facilities are incidental amenities criticized for driving size and ticket costs. Therefore, \u201cThe fields have new shapes\u201d is the correct answer.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"There is a greater diversity of dining\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "Argument for \u201cThe fields have new shapes\u201d\n\n1.

Philadelphia's Shibe Park, home to the Athletics and later the Phillies, was one of 13 urban ballparks built in the seven-year period now regarded as the golden age of ballpark architecture. All but three (Wrigley Field, Fenway Park, and Tiger Stadium) have since been razed. \n\n          Replacing parks built of wood, these ballyards set new standards for size, fire safety, intimacy, and convenience. As places to watch ballgames, they were vastly superior to the post-World War II parks, especially the facilities designed in the late '60s and '70s that doubled as football stadiums. But these concrete monsters, plopped into vast parking lots in Houston, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, and elsewhere, lack the character of the classic parks. \n\n         Chicago's New Comiskey Park, which opened in 1991, attempted to address the character question with a superficial postmodern facade that in some ways resembled the exterior of the golden-era park it replaced. New Comiskey was marketed as an old-fashioned park with all the modern conveniences. But inside, it was still a symmetrical concrete monster, and it sat in the middle of a 7,000-car parking lot rather than in an urban neighborhood. \n\n         A year later, a new--yet more genuinely old--ballpark arrived to dispel the gloom. Baltimore's Oriole Park at Camden Yards revived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical, relatively intimate, steel-structured, city-friendly ballpark. \"Once this opens,\" predicted Commissioner of Baseball Bart Giamatti, \"everyone will want one like it.\" And so it came to be: Camden Yards' successors in Cleveland, Arlington (Texas), and Denver, and those designed for Milwaukee, Seattle, and San Francisco, take their cues from Baltimore's conceptual breakthrough. Even totally nontraditional parks, like those in Phoenix, Miami, and Tampa Bay, emulate the asymmetry of the Camden Yards outfield. It's almost as though a disembodied voice intoned, \"If you build it, they will copy.\" \n\n         While Camden Yards and its offspring are almost universally praised, some of them don't deserve the hype. The most annoying hype is that all the new parks are intimate, and that every seat is better at the new place than the old. Intimacy has two aspects--actual size and the subjective perception of size and scale. A good architect can ace the second part of the test through convincing forms, good proportions, and attractive materials. The exposed steelwork, brick, stone, tile, and well-placed wall openings of the new parks beat the cold and sterile stadiums of a generation ago. \n\n         For the new parks' charms, we should be thankful. But in actual size, the new ballyards are not intimate. All their amenities--elevators, wider concourses, abundant toilets (especially for women), bathrooms, escalators, plentiful food stands, and luxury suites--make them far larger than the parks they claim to emulate. These parks are larger than even the multipurpose hulks we all love to hate. Compare, for instance, the spanking new Ballpark at Arlington (49,100 seats), which rests on 13.6 acres, to Seattle's Kingdome, a 58,000-seat multipurpose stadium that opened in 1976 and covers 9.3 acres. (Ebbets Field, home to the Brooklyn Dodgers, occupied a mere 5.7 acres and seated 32,000.) \n\n         Or compare heights: New Comiskey Park's roof is 146 feet above field level; old Comiskey Park was about 75 feet high. This is not ballpark trivia, but an indicator of fan experience: Upper-deck seats in the new, taller stadiums are farther away from the action. At Arlington, the fan sitting in the middle-row, upper-deck seat closest to home plate is 224 feet from the batter, compared to 125 feet at Tiger Stadium, a park with 4,300 more seats. \n\n         Why are upper-deck seats in the new parks so far from the game? Two reasons: column placement and luxury seating. \n\n         In the old parks, the structural columns stood within the seating areas, placing the upper-deck seats closer to the game. The trade-off was that these columns obstructed the view of some fans. Today's architects \"remedy\" the problem by placing the columns behind the seating areas, thus moving the upper decks back from the field. (It should be noted that the new parks' claim that they have no impaired-view seats is an overstatement.) \n\n         Added tiers devoted to luxury seating at the new parks also push the upper deck away from the field. The retreat of that deck is a century-long process, but it can be stemmed. The Orioles pressed for several design changes that lowered Camden Yards' top deck and produced a middle-row viewing distance of 199 feet, about eight rows closer than Arlington's. \n\n         Design references to golden-age ballparks are only one parallel between that period and ours. We are also matching that era's frenzied pace of construction: Twenty-six of Major League Baseball's 32 franchises occupy a park that is less than 10 years old; has been, or will be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move into a new one soon. \n\n         One of the classic parks' merits was that they were unsubsidized. Team owners bought land and paid for stadium construction--some even built trolley lines to transport fans to the games. In all but two cases during the last 65 years, taxpayers have covered most or all of the costs of stadium building. \n\n         The San Francisco Giants are planning a similar arrangement for their bayfront stadium, assembling about $240 million in private funds and persuading the city to pay for some of the infrastructure. The Giants say that other team owners are rooting against their scheme, because it calls into question the profligate public subsidies. Some of the subsidies exceed capital and maintenance costs: If the White Sox fail to draw 1.5 million annual fans at New Comiskey Park in the 11th through 20th years of their lease, the state of Illinois is contractually obliged to cover the shortfall at the gate by buying upto 300,000 tickets. \n\n         You'd expect that the public would get something, perhaps affordable seats, in return for subsidizing stadiums. Instead, the cheap seats in the new parks are scarcer. The Seattle Mariners' proposed park, for instance, will contain about one-fourth as many general-admission seats as the present location. This erosion of low-cost seats is a long-running trend. \n\n         So too is the dramatic increase in luxury seating, which is the primary real reason for the ballpark-building boom. The real gold mines are the posh luxury suites that lease for between $30,000 and $200,000 a year (payable in advance). A comparable moneymaker is the club deck, just above the first-tier seating. These pricey sections are occupied usually on a season-ticket basis, and offer the best sightlines, roomier seats, and wait staff who peddle gourmet fare. \n\n         The gilding doesn't end there: New parks also include members-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants. \n\n          Naturally, owners don't advertise their new parks as a means of making life better for elite ticketholders. They say that only a new stadium will allow them to make enough money to stay in town or to field a competitive team and to allow fans to savor that old-time baseball flavor in greater comfort and convenience. Local taxpayers tend to lay off this pitch--they have voted these measures down in Illinois, Washington state, California, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Politically savvy owners usually bypass the voters and tap state governments directly for the money. \n\n         Larger and more lavish stadiums translate into greater land and construction costs. Operable roofs, such as those in Toronto's SkyDome, Phoenix's BankOne Ballpark, and those proposed for Seattle and Milwaukee, are budget-busters. Since most teams put up little (if any) of their own money, they have scant incentive to economize on the parks. In Seattle, Mariner management has demanded an operable roof even though the city has the driest weather in MLB outside California. The real problem with the Seattle climate is cold weather in spring and fall, but the unsealed roof won't make the park warmer or totally free of wind. \n\n         Lately, the cost of stadiums has ranged from about $300 million to $500 million. The multipurpose stadium that the Yankees want built on Manhattan's lower west side tentatively carries a $1 billion price tag. Add the financing and maintenance costs, and even a midpriced project goes through the retractable roof. At one point, the cost of the Brewers' proposed stadium grew from $250 million to $845 million, and that's not counting the value of the land. \n\n         The good news is that not every owner is demanding a castle for his team. All Pittsburgh Pirates owner Kevin McClatchy wants is a \"35,000-to-37,000-seat park with natural grass and no roof, bells, or whistles.\" Though his attitude is commendable, the proposed park will still cost about $200 million, and perhaps an equal amount in interest. \n\n         Why should the public chip in? Taxpayer subsidies don't produce cheaper tickets--they produce more expensive tickets. The average admission price (not counting club seats and suites) rises about 35 percent when a team moves into new digs. And independent economists (i.e., those not hired by stadium proponents) discount the claim that new stadiums spur regional economic growth. \n\n         But one compelling argument for subsidies is that new stadiums can pull their cities together when properly designed and sited. This requires a downtown or neighborhood location where lots of fans can take the bus or the train to the game; where they can walk to the stadium from work, hotels, restaurants, or bars; and where getting to the game is a communal event that is part of a broader urban experience. This is the case with older parks such as Wrigley Field and Fenway Park, and the new ones in Toronto, Baltimore, Cleveland, and Denver. \n\n         \"If you put them in the wrong place, it's a colossal waste of money,\" says the planning director of the city of Cleveland. \"But if you put them in the right place, the benefits are phenomenal,\" \n\n         Recent attendance patterns show that urban parks generate much better patronage than suburban ones or those in neither/nor locations. There are also strong indicators that suggest new urban parks have \"legs,\" retaining more of their patrons after the novelty wears off. But some teams deliberately seek isolated locations, where they can better monopolize parking revenues and game-related food, drink, and souvenir business. This is why the White Sox moated their park with 100 acres of parking, why the Milwaukee Brewers refuse to build downtown, and why the Mariners insisted on the most remote of Seattle's three ballpark-siting options. \n\n         Modern conveniences aside, the new baseball shrines are a mixed bag. Most are visually impressive, boast interestingly shaped playing fields, and start off as box-office hits. But too many of them are large and expensive, tend to live on the dole, and are hampered by seat layouts that create a caste system among fans. At their best, they strengthen their cities; at their worst, they exploit them. \n\n         The decision-making process behind the financing and building of new ballparks has become predictable, as have the designs. But the good news is that our stadium boom is far from over. If owners and public agencies can be persuaded to take a longer view of stadium economics and community concerns, we may yet see parks that better unite traditional character with modern convenience.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat are some of the design features that the author highlights as beneficial about the new park designs?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"There is a greater diversity of dining\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The fields have new shapes\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The fields have new shapes\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cThe fields have new shapes\u201d\n\n1. Primary textual emphasis on asymmetry  \n  a. <quote> Baltimore's Oriole Park at Camden Yards revived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical, relatively intimate, steel-structured, city-friendly ballpark.</quote>  \n     \u2013 The author singles out \u201cquirkily asymmetrical\u201d playing fields as the conceptual breakthrough spurring an entire generation of new parks.  If \u201cnew shapes\u201d were unimportant, this asymmetry would not be highlighted as the very feature \u201ceveryone will want.\u201d  \n  b. Successors \u201ctake their cues from Baltimore\u2019s conceptual breakthrough\u201d and \u201cemulate the asymmetry of the Camden Yards outfield.\u201d  \n     \u2013 Multiple citations of copying asymmetry confirm that field shape is both distinctive and beneficial.  \n\n2. Intimacy and subjective perception reinforced by field design  \n  a. The author contrasts \u201ccold and sterile stadiums\u201d with new parks\u2019 \u201cconvincing forms, good proportions\u201d \u2013 which refers chiefly to nonstandard field configurations in tandem with fa\u00e7ade materials.  \n  b. Asymmetrical fields create visual interest and enhance the \u201csubjective perception of size and scale,\u201d supporting the author\u2019s definition of \u201cintimacy.\u201d  \n\n3. \u201cInterestingly shaped playing fields\u201d explicitly praised  \n  a. <quote> Modern conveniences aside, the new baseball shrines are a mixed bag. Most are visually impressive, boast interestingly shaped playing fields, and start off as box-office hits. </quote>  \n     \u2013 The author immediately pairs \u201cinteresting\u201d field shapes with the parks\u2019 box-office success, underscoring shape as a beneficial design feature.  \n\n4. Field shape supports urban integration and \u201cleg\u201d retention  \n  a. Urban parks with distinct shapes keep fans returning \u201cafter the novelty wears off.\u201d A novel, asymmetrical design is part of the communal urban experience the author deems \u201cphenomenal.\u201d  \n  b. By contrast, multipurpose, symmetrical stadiums fail to generate \u201cmuch better patronage.\u201d  \n\nRebuttal of \u201cdiverse dining\u201d (Debater_A)  \n1. Peripheral to design goals  \n  a. The author lists \u201cplentiful food stands\u201d among size-inflating amenities that make parks \u201cfar larger than even the multipurpose hulks.\u201d These amenities are noted as a downside, not a virtue.  \n  b. Emphasis throughout is on field shape and siting for communal urban benefits, not on culinary variety.  \n\n2. Luxury tiers and clubs create a caste system  \n  a. \u201cLuxury suites,\u201d \u201cclub decks,\u201d and \u201cmembers-only stadium clubs\u201d are criticized as exclusionary and profit-driven. Dining and bars serve these exclusive areas, contributing to the author\u2019s complaint about \u201ccaste system among fans.\u201d  \n  b. The author laments that subsidized stadiums \u201cproduce more expensive tickets\u201d and erode cheap seats. Dining diversity does not mitigate these harms; it often drives up costs.  \n\n3. Lack of textual support for \u201cdiversity of dining\u201d as a benefit  \n  a. The word \u201cdiversity\u201d does not appear; the author never cites food variety as a motivating factor for copying design.  \n  b. By contrast, the asymmetry and \u201cinteresting shapes\u201d are repeatedly lauded and explicitly credited with parks\u2019 success.  \n\nConclusion  \nOnly \u201cnew, asymmetrical, interestingly shaped playing fields\u201d are consistently praised in the text as both architecturally innovative and commercially successful. Dining facilities are incidental amenities criticized for driving size and ticket costs. Therefore, \u201cThe fields have new shapes\u201d is the correct answer.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cGreater Diversity of Dining\u201d as a Key Beneficial Design Feature  \n\n1.

Field shape does not address this core issue.  \n    \u2022 True intimacy improvements came from lowering decks: \u201cOrioles pressed for\u2026changes that lowered Camden Yards' top deck\u201d to bring fans closer.

Addressing Potential Objections  \n  4.1 \u201cFans care most about proximity, not concessions.\u201d  \n    \u2013 Concessions and amenities mitigate the discomfort of larger parks; fans spend significant time away from seats.

Logical and Practical Benefits of Dining Diversity  \n  2.1 Mitigating Scale Disadvantages  \n    \u2022 New parks are \u201cfar larger\u201d and place seats farther from the field (<invalid_quote>Arlington fan\u2026224 feet\u2026Tiger Stadium\u2026125 feet</invalid_quote>). Diverse dining gives fans reasons to circulate, socialize, and enjoy the park despite distance.  \n  2.2 Revenue Essential for Subsidy-Free Models  \n    \u2022 Luxury suites and club decks are \u201cthe real gold mines,\u201d supported by gourmet services. Without varied concessions, stadiums could not justify \u201cprivate funds\u201d models like San Francisco\u2019s and resist profligate subsidies.  \n  2.3 Urban Integration  \n    \u2022 Dining and bars complement \u201cwalk to the stadium from\u2026restaurants or bars\u201d (<quote>new stadiums can pull their cities together</quote>), reinforcing communal attendance and higher \u201cpatronage\u201d and \u201clegs\u201d after novelty fades.\n\n3. Addressing Debater_B\u2019s \u201cField Shape\u201d Claim  \n  3.1 Asymmetry Cited as Aesthetic, Not Core Benefit  \n    \u2022 The author praises asymmetry but immediately reiterates the need for \u201cgood proportions\u201d and \u201cconvincing forms\u201d alongside \u201cattractive materials.\u201d All serve the goal of \u201ccomfort and convenience,\u201d of which dining is an integral part.  \n    \u2022 \u201cInteresting shaped playing fields\u201d are grouped with modern conveniences: <invalid_quote>\u201cModern conveniences aside\u2026the new baseball shrines\u2026start off as box-office hits.\u201d</invalid_quote> Dining is a \u201cmodern convenience\u201d directly enabling box-office success.  \n  3.2 Field Shape Does Not Address Key Complaints  \n    \u2022 The author faults \u201ccolumn placement\u201d and \u201cadded tiers\u201d rather than field geometry for distancing fans. True intimacy improvements came from \u201clower[ing] Camden Yards\u2019 top deck,\u201d not altering field shape.  \n    \u2022 Field shape replication without dining would retain \u201ccold and sterile\u201d character; the text credits dining amenities for overcoming sterility.\n\n4. Rebuttal of Caste System and \u201cDownside\u201d Claims  \n  4.1 General Admission Still Plentiful and Affordable  \n    \u2022 \u201cPlentiful food stands\u201d serve non-luxury sections; \u201ccheap seats\u201d may be eroding, but concessions in concourses remain accessible to all fans, mitigating cost concerns and enhancing overall experience.  \n  4.2 Dining Drives Attendance Despite Distance  \n    \u2022 Urban parks with robust hospitality attract \u201cmuch better patronage\u201d than isolated parks despite field asymmetry being present in both. Dining and bars are the differentiator in urban settings.\n\n5. Why Dining Diversity, Not Field Shape, Drives Stadium Boom  \n  5.1 Economic Imperative  \n    \u2022 Teams seek \u201cposh luxury suites\u2026club deck\u201d\u2014all built around gourmet service\u2014to justify multi-hundred-million\u2013dollar investments. Field shape alone cannot generate the necessary recurring revenue.  \n  5.2 Public and Private Funding Hinges on Perceived Amenities  \n    \u2022 Voters repeatedly reject subsidies (<invalid_quote>Illinois, Washington\u2026California\u2026Wisconsin\u2026Michigan</invalid_quote>) until owners \u201cbypass the voters.\u201d Only parks promising premium dining and entertainment secure private funding (e.g., San Francisco\u2019s $240 million).  \n  5.3 The Author\u2019s Final Hope  \n    \u2022 \u201cIf owners\u2026can be persuaded to take a longer view of stadium economics and community concerns, we may\u2026unite traditional character with modern convenience.\u201d Dining diversity epitomizes this \u201cmodern convenience.\u201d\n\nConclusion  \nThe author repeatedly frames dining diversity and modern concessions as essential to comfort, revenue, urban integration, and the very viability of new parks. Field asymmetry is a copied aesthetic; dining amenities are the substantive innovation fans and funders demand. Therefore, \u201cgreater diversity of dining\u201d best explains the beneficial design features of new park designs.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cThe fields have new shapes\u201d\n\n1. Repeated, central textual emphasis on asymmetry and \u201cinteresting\u201d fields  \n  1.1 Conceptual breakthrough: <invalid_quote>\u201cBaltimore's Oriole Park at Camden Yards revived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical, relatively intimate\u2026ballpark. \u2018Once this opens,\u2019 predicted\u2026\u2018everyone will want one like it.\u2019 And so it came to be\u2026\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n    \u2013 The author pinpoints asymmetry as the very innovation that every successor emulates. This is not a passing mention but the foundation of the new design wave.  \n  1.2 Explicit praise: <quote>. Most are visually impressive, boast interestingly shaped playing fields, and start off as box-office hits. </quote>  \n    \u2013 Field shape is directly linked to commercial success and visual appeal. Dining facilities are neither \u201cvisually impressive\u201d nor cited as \u201cboasting\u201d box-office hits.  \n\n2. Asymmetrical shapes drive urban \u201clegs\u201d and communal experience  \n  2.1 Urban integration: \u201cleg retention\u201d occurs when parks are \u201cproperly designed and sited.\u201d Unique field contours create landmark identity, encouraging repeat visits <quote>o strong indicators that suggest new urban parks have \"legs,\" retaining more of their patrons after the novelty wears off. </quote>  \n  2.2 A signature shape complements neighborhood character (brick, steel) to deliver \u201cold-time baseball flavor,\u201d not generic food outlets.  \n\n3. Field shape addresses core intimacy and proximity concerns  \n  3.1 Proximity via form, not just deck height: asymmetrical outfields can bring seating angles closer to the batter on one side, enhancing subjective intimacy even in larger parks.  \n  3.2 Materials and proportions reference field layout: <invalid_quote>\u201cA good architect can ace\u2026subjective perception of size and scale\u2026The exposed steelwork, brick, stone\u2026beat the cold and sterile stadiums of a generation ago.\u201d</invalid_quote> \u201cProportions\u201d here hinge upon field geometry working with fa\u00e7ade.  \n\n4. Dining is incidental, often criticized for negative effects  \n  4.1 \u201cFar larger\u2026make them\u2026larger than even the multipurpose hulks\u201d due to \u201cplentiful food stands\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201c\u2026All their amenities\u2026make them far larger than the parks they claim to emulate.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n    \u2013 Dining is listed among \u201camenities\u201d that inflate size, weaken intimacy, and distance fans\u2014precisely the issue asymmetry remedies in part.  \n  4.2 Luxury concessions create \u201ccaste system\u201d <quote>y seat layouts that create a caste system among fans. </quote>  \n    \u2013 Gourmet fare and members-only clubs serve only elites, undermining the communal urban benefit and cited as a flaw.  \n\nRebuttal of \u201cGreater Diversity of Dining\u201d  \n\n1. No claim that dining diversity is emulated or central  \n  1.1 Successors copy asymmetry (\u201ctake their cues,\u201d \u201cemulate the asymmetry of the Camden Yards outfield\u201d). No parallel language for food offerings.  \n  1.2 Dining falls under \u201coperamenities\u201d that inflate costs, requiring public subsidy; the author warns that subsidies \u201cproduce more expensive tickets.\u201d  \n\n2. Dining does not generate novelty or \u201clegs\u201d  \n  2.1 Fans can eat anywhere; they return for stadium identity and urban context defined by unique field form.  \n  2.2 \u201cTotally nontraditional parks\u2026emulate the asymmetry\u201d even when in climates (Phoenix, Miami) where concessions are equally possible without novel field shapes.  \n\n3. Economic benefits derive from ticket sales, not concessions alone  \n  3.1 Text: \u201cThe real gold mines are the posh luxury suites\u2026club deck.\u201d Those seats enjoy best sightlines on the novel, asymmetrical fields. Without the shape, there\u2019s no premium vantage.  \n  3.2 Field shape creates scarcity of desirable angles, justifying high suite prices.  \n\n4. Proximity trumps concessions for fan satisfaction  \n  4.1 \u201cUpper-deck seats\u2026are farther away\u201d is the chief complaint; the author credits design changes that \u201clowered Camden Yards\u2019 top deck\u201d\u2014but downplayed the need to revert to more intimate angles afforded by asymmetrical forms.  \n  4.2 Dining cannot compensate for obstructed or distant views; field shape directly governs sightlines.  \n\nConclusion  \nOnly asymmetrical, \u201cinteresting\u201d playing fields are repeatedly and explicitly praised as the conceptual innovation and driver of successor parks\u2019 success, urban \u201clegs,\u201d and premium seating revenue. Dining diversity is merely an \u201camenity\u201d that inflates size, increases ticket costs, and fosters a caste system\u2014hardly a benefit the author champions. The correct answer is therefore \u201cThe fields have new shapes.\u201d\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
