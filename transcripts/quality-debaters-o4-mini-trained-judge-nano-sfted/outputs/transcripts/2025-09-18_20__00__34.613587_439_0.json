    "background_text": "Planet of No-Return By WILBUR S. PEACOCK The orders were explicit: \"Destroy the\n\n 'THING' of Venus.\" But Patrolmen Kerry\n\n Blane and Splinter Wood, their space-ship\n\n wrecked, could not follow orders\u2014their\n\n weapons were useless on the Water-world.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Winter 1942.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Old Kerry Blane exploded.\n\n\n \"Damn it!\" he roared. \"I don't like you; and I don't like this ship;  and I don't like the assignment; and I don't like those infernal pills  you keep eating; and I\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Splinter\" Wood grinned.\n\n\n \"Seems to me, Kerry,\" he remarked humorously, \"that you don't like much  of anything!\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane growled unintelligibly, batted the injector lever with a  calloused hand. His grizzled hair was a stiff wiry mop on his small  head, and his oversize jaw was thrust belligerently forward. But deep  within his eyes, where he hoped it was hidden, was a friendly twinkle  that gave the lie to his speech.\n\n\n \"You're a squirt!\" he snapped disagreeably. \"You're not dry behind  the ears, yet. You're like the rest of these kids who call themselves  pilots\u2014only more so! And why the hell the chief had to sic you on me,  on an exploration trip this important\u2014well, I'll never understand.\"\n\n\n Splinter rolled his six foot three of lanky body into a more  comfortable position on the air-bunk. He yawned tremendously, fumbled a  small box from his shirt pocket, and removed a marble-like capsule.\n\n\n \"Better take one of these,\" he warned. \"You're liable to get the space  bends at any moment.\"\n\n\n Old Kerry Blane snorted, batted the box aside impatiently, scowled  moodily at the capsules that bounced for a moment against the pilot  room's walls before hanging motionless in the air.\n\n\n \"Mister Wood,\" he said icily, \"I was flying a space ship while they  were changing your pants twenty times a day. When I want advice on how  to fly a ship, how to cure space bends, how to handle a Zelta ray, or  how to spit\u2014I'll ask you! Until then, you and your bloody marbles can  go plumb straight to the devil!\"\n\n\n \"Tsk! Tsk! Tsk!\" Splinter reached out lazily, plucked the capsules from  the air, one by one.\n\n\n Kerry Blane lit one of the five allotted cigarettes of the day.\n\n\n \"Don't 'tsk' me, you young squirt,\" he grunted around a mouthful of  fragrant smoke. \"I know all the arguments you can put up; ain't that  all I been hearing for a week? You take your vitamins A, B, C, D, all  you want, but you leave me alone\u2014or I'll stuff your head down your  throat, P.D.Q.!\"\n\n\n \"All right, all right!\" Splinter tucked the capsule box back into his  pocket, grinned mockingly. \"But don't say I didn't warn you. With this  shielded ship, and with no sunlight reaching Venus' surface, you're  gonna be begging for some of my vitamin, super-concentrated pills  before we get back to Earth.\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane made a rich, ripe noise with his mouth.\n\n\n \"Pfuii!\" he said very distinctly.\n\n\n \"Gracious!\" Splinter said in mock horror. They made a strange contrast as they lay in their air bunks. Splinter  was fully a head taller than the dour Irishman, and his lanky build  gave a false impression of awkwardness. While the vitriolic Kerry Blane  was short and compact, strength and quickness evident in every movement.\n\n\n Kerry Blane had flown every type of ship that rode in space. In the  passing years, he had flight-tested almost every new experimental ship,  had flown them with increasing skill, had earned a reputation as a  trouble shooter on any kind of craft.\n\n\n But even Kerry Blane had to retire eventually.\n\n\n A great retirement banquet had been given in his honor by the  Interplanetary Squadron. There had been the usual speeches and  presentations; and Kerry Blane had heard them all, had thanked the  donors of the gifts. But it was not until the next morning, when he was  dressed in civilian clothes for the first time in forty years, that he  realized the enormity of the thing that had happened to his life.\n\n\n Something died within Kerry Blane's heart that morning, shriveled and  passed away, leaving him suddenly shrunken and old. He had become like  a rusty old freighter couched between the gleaming bodies of great  space warriors.\n\n\n Finally, as a last resort so that he would not be thrown entirely  aside, he had taken a desk job in the squadron offices. For six years  he had dry-rotted there, waiting hopefully for the moment when his  active services would be needed again.\n\n\n It was there that he had met and liked the ungainly Splinter Wood.  There was something in the boy that had found a kindred spirit in Kerry  Blane's heart, and he had taken the youngster in hand to give him the  benefits of experience that had become legendary.\n\n\n Splinter Wood was a probationary pilot, had been admitted to the  Interplanetary Squadron because of his inherent skill, even though his  formal education had been fairly well neglected. Now, the two of them rode the pounding jets of a DX cruiser, bound  for Venus to make a personal survey of its floating islands for the  Interplanetary Squadron's Medical Division.\n\n\n \"Ten to one we don't get back!\" Splinter said pessimistically.\n\n\n Kerry Blane scrubbed out his cigarette, scowled bleakly at the  instrument panel. He sensed the faint thread of fear in the youngster's  tone, and a nostalgic twinge touched his heart, for he was remembering  the days of his youth when he had a full life to look forward to.\n\n\n \"If you're afraid, you can get out and walk back,\" he snapped  disagreeably.\n\n\n A grin lifted the corners of Splinter's long mouth, spread into his  eyes. His hand unconsciously came up, touched the tiny squadron pin on  his lapel.\n\n\n \"Sorry to disappoint you, glory grabber,\" he said mockingly, \"but I've  got definite orders to take care of you.\"\n\n\n \" Me! You've got orders to take care of me ?\" Kerry Blane choked  incoherently for a moment, red tiding cholerically upward from his  loosened collar.\n\n\n \"Of course!\" Splinter grinned.\n\n\n Kerry Blane exploded, words spewing volcanically forth. Splinter  relaxed, his booted foot beating out a dull rhythm to the colorful  language learned through almost fifty years of spacing. And at last,  when Kerry Blane had quieted until he but smoldered, he leaned over and  touched the old spacer on the sleeve.\n\n\n \"Seventy-eight!\" he remarked pleasantly.\n\n\n \"Seventy-eight what?\" Kerry Blane asked sullenly, the old twinkle  beginning to light again deep in his eyes.\n\n\n \"Seventy-eight new words\u2014and you swore them beautifully!\" Splinter  beamed. \"Some day you can teach them to me.\"\n\n\n They laughed then, Old Kerry Blane and young Splinter Wood, and  the warmth of their friendship was a tangible thing in the small  control-room of the cruiser.\n\n\n And in the midst of their laughter, Old Kerry Blane choked in agony,  surged desperately against his bunk straps.\n\n\n He screamed unknowingly, feeling only the horrible excruciating agony  of his body, tasting the blood that gushed from his mouth and nostrils.  His muscles were knotted cords that he could not loosen, and his blood  was a surging stream that pounded at his throbbing temples. The air he  breathed seemed to be molten flame.\n\n\n His body arced again and again against the restraining straps, and his  mouth was open in a soundless scream. He sensed dimly that his partner  had wrenched open a wall door, removed metal medicine kits, and was  fumbling through their contents. He felt the bite of the hypodermic,  felt a deadly numbness replace the raging torment that had been his  for seconds. He swallowed three capsules automatically, passed into a  coma-like sleep, woke hours later to stare clear-eyed into Splinter's  concerned face.\n\n\n \"Close, wasn't it?\" he said weakly, conversationally.\n\n\n \"Close enough!\" Splinter agreed relievedly. \"If you had followed my  advice and taken those vitamin capsules, you'd never have had the  bends.\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane grinned, winced when he felt the dull ache in his body.\n\n\n \"I've had the bends before, and lived through them!\" he said, still  weakly defiant.\n\n\n \"That's the past,\" Splinter said quietly. \"This is the present, and you  take your pills every day, just as I do\u2014from now on.\"\n\n\n \"All right\u2014and thanks!\"\n\n\n \"Forget it!\" Splinter flushed in quick embarrassment.\n\n\n A buzzer sounded from the instrument panel, and a tiny light glowed  redly.\n\n\n \"Six hours more,\" Splinter said, turned to the instrument panel.\n\n\n His long hands played over the instrument panel, checking, controlling  the rocket fire, adjusting delicate instruments to hairline marks.  Kerry Blane nodded in silent approval.\n\n\n They could feel the first tug of gravity on their bodies, and through  the vision port could see the greenish ball that was cloud-covered  Venus. Excitement lifted their spirits, brought light to their eyes as  they peered eagerly ahead.\n\n\n \"What's it really like?\" Splinter asked impatiently.\n\n\n Kerry Blane yawned, settled back luxuriously. \"I'll tell you later,\" he  said, \"I'm going to take a nap and try to ease this bellyache of mine.  Wake me up so that I can take over, when we land; Venus is a tricky  place to set a ship on.\"\n\n\n He yawned again, drifted instantly into sleep, relaxing with the  ability of a spaceman who sleeps when and if he can. Splinter smiled  down at his sleeping partner, then turned back to the quartzite port.  He shook his head a bit, remembering the stories he had heard about the  water planet, wondering\u2014wondering\u2014 II\n\n\n Venus was a fluffy cotton ball hanging motionless in bottomless  space. Far to the left, Mercury gleamed like a polished diamond in  the sunlight. Kerry Blane cut the driving rockets, let the cruiser  sink into a fast gravity-dive, guiding it only now and then by a brief  flicker of a side jet.\n\n\n Splinter Wood watched breathlessly from the vision port, his long face  eager and reckless, his eyes seeking to pierce the clouds that roiled  and twisted uneasily over the surface of the planet.\n\n\n Kerry Blane glanced tolerantly at his young companion, felt a nostalgic  tug at his heart when he remembered the first time he had approached  the water-planet years before. Then, he had been a young and reckless  firebrand, his fame already spreading, an unquenchable fire of  adventure flaming in his heart.\n\n\n Now, his aged but steady fingers rested lightly on the controls,  brought the patrol cruiser closer to the cloud-banks on the line of  demarcation between the sunward and sunless sides of the planet. He  hummed tunelessly, strangely happy, as he peered ahead.\n\n\n \"Val Kenton died there,\" Splinter whispered softly, \"Died to save the  lives of three other people!\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane nodded. \"Yes,\" he agreed, and his voice changed subtly.  \"Val was a blackguard, a criminal; but he died in the best traditions  of the service.\" He sighed. \"He never had a chance.\"\n\n\n \"Murdered!\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane smiled grimly. \"I guess I used too broad an interpretation  of the word,\" he said gently. \"Anyway, one of our main tasks is to  destroy the thing that killed him.\"\n\n\n His lean fingers tightened unconsciously.\n\n\n \"I'd like nothing better than to turn a Zelta-blaster on that chunk of  living protoplasm and cremate it.\"\n\n\n Splinters shivered slightly. \"Do you think we'll find it?\" he asked.\n\n\n Kerry Blane nodded. \"I think it will find us; after all, it's just an  animated appetite looking for food.\"\n\n\n He turned back to the controls, flipped a switch, and the cutting of  the nose rocket dropped the ship in an angling glide toward the clouds  a few miles below. Gravity was full strength now, and although not as  great as Earth's, was still strong enough to bring a sense of giddiness  to the men.\n\n\n \"Here we go!\" Splinter said tonelessly.\n\n\n The great cottony batts of roiling clouds rushed up to meet the ship,  bringing the first sense of violent movement in more than a week of  flying. There was something awesome and breath-taking in the speed with  which the ship dropped toward the planet.\n\n\n Tendrils of vapor touched the ports, were whipped aside, then were  replaced by heavier fingers of cloud. Kerry Blane pressed a firing  stud, and nose rockets thrummed in a rising crescendo as the free fall  of the cruiser was checked. Heat rose in the cabin from the friction of  the outer air, then dissipated, as the force-screen voltometer leaped  higher.\n\n\n Then, as though it had never been, the sun disappeared, and there was  only a gray blankness pressing about the ship. Gone was all sense of  movement, and the ship seemed to hover in a gray nothingness.\n\n\n Kerry Blane crouched over the control panel, his hands moving deftly,  his eyes flicking from one instrument to another. Tiny lines of  concentration etched themselves about his mouth, and perspiration  beaded his forehead. He rode that cruiser through the miles of clouds  through sheer instinctive ability, seeming to fly it as though he were  an integral part of the ship.\n\n\n Splinter Wood watched him with awe in his eyes, seeing for the first  time the incredible instinct that had made Kerry Blane the idol of a  billion people. He relaxed visibly, all instinctive fear allayed by the  brilliant competence of his companion.\n\n\n Seconds flowed into moments, and the moments merged into one another,  and still the clouds pressed with a visible strength against the  ports. The rockets drummed steadily, holding the ship aloft, dropping  it slowly toward the planet below. Then the clouds thinned, and,  incredibly, were permeated with a dim and glowing light. A second  later, and the clouds were gone, and a thousand feet below tumbled and  tossed in a majestic display of ruthless strength an ocean that seemed  to be composed of liquid fluorescence.\n\n\n Kerry Blane heard Splinter's instant sigh of unbelief.\n\n\n \"Good Lord!\" Splinter said, \"What\u2014\"\n\n\n His voice stilled, and he was silent, his eyes drinking in the weird  incredible scene below. The ocean was a shifting, white-capped wash of silvery light that  gleamed with a bright phosphorescence of a hundred, intermingled,  kaleidoscopic colors. And the unreal, unearthly light continued  unbroken everywhere, reflected from the low-hanging clouds, reaching  to the far horizon, bathing every detail of the planet in a brilliance  more bright than moonlight.\n\n\n Splinter turned a wondering face. \"But the official reports say that  there is no light on Venus,\" he exclaimed. \"That was one of the reasons  given when exploration was forbidden!\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane nodded. \"That was merely a pretext to keep foolhardy  spacemen from losing their lives on the planet. In reality, the  ocean is alive with an incredibly tiny marine worm that glows  phosphorescently. The light generated from those billions of worms is  reflected back from the clouds, makes Venus eternally lighted.\"\n\n\n He turned the ship to the North, relaxed a bit on the air bunk. He  felt tired and worn, his body aching from the space bends of a few  hours before.\n\n\n \"Take over,\" he said wearily. \"Take the ship North, and watch for any  island.\"\n\n\n Splinter nodded, rested his long hands on the controls. The space  cruiser lifted a bit in a sudden spurt of speed, and the rocket-sound  was a solid thrum of unleashed power.\n\n\n Kerry Blane lit a cigarette, leaned toward a vision port. He felt again  that thrill he had experienced when he had first flashed his single-man  cruiser through the clouds years before. Then the breath caught in his  throat, and he tapped his companion's arm.\n\n\n \"Take a look!\" he called excitedly.\n\n\n They fought in the ocean below, fought in a never-ending splashing of  what seemed to be liquid fire. It was like watching a tri-dim screen of  a news event, except for the utter lack of sound.\n\n\n One was scaly, while the other was skinned, and both were fully three  hundred feet long. Great scimitars of teeth flashed in the light, and  blood gouted and stained the water crimson whenever a slashing blow was  struck. They threshed in a mad paroxysm of rage, whirling and spinning  in the phosphorescent water like beings from a nightmare, exploding  out of their element time and again, only to fall back in a gargantuan  spray of fluorescence.\n\n\n And then the scaly monster flashed in a half-turn, drove forward with  jaws agape, wrenched and ripped at the smooth black throat of the other  creature. The second creature rippled and undulated in agony, whipping  the ocean to foam, then went limp. The victorious monster circled the  body of its dead foe, then, majestically, plunged from sight into the  ocean's depths. An instant later, the water frothed, as hundreds of  lesser marine monsters attacked and fed on the floating corpse.\n\n\n \"Brrrr!\" Splinter shivered in sudden horror.\n\n\n Kerry Blane chuckled dryly. \"Feel like going for a swim?\" he asked  conversationally.\n\n\n Splinter shook his head, watched the scene disappear from view to the  rear of the line of flight, then sank back onto his bunk.\n\n\n \"Not me!\" he said deprecatingly.\n\n\n Kerry Blane chuckled again, swung the cruiser toward the tiny smudge of  black on the horizon. Glowing water flashed beneath the ship, seeming  to smooth into a gleaming mirror shot with dancing colors. There was no  sign of life anywhere.\n\n\n Thirty minutes later, Kerry Blane circled the island that floated  free in the phosphorescent ocean. His keen eyes searched the tangled  luxuriant growth of the jungle below, searching for some indication  that the protoplasmic monster he seeked was there.\n\n\n \"I don't see anything suspicious,\" Splinter contributed.\n\n\n \"There's nothing special to see,\" Kerry Blane said shortly. \"As I  understand it, anyway, this chunk of animated appetite hangs around an  island shaped like a turtle. However, our orders are to investigate  every island, just in case there might be more than one of the  monsters.\"\n\n\n Splinter buckled on his dis-gun, excitement flaring in his eyes.\n\n\n \"Let's do a little exploring?\" he said eagerly.\n\n\n Kerry Blane shook his head, swung the cruiser north again.\n\n\n \"Plenty of time for that later,\" he said mildly. \"We'll find this  turtle-island, make a landing, and take a look around. Later, if we're  lucky enough to blow our objective to Kingdom Come, we'll do a little  exploring of the other islands.\"\n\n\n \"Hell!\" Splinter scowled in mock disgust. \"An old woman like you should  be taking in knitting for a living!\"\n\n\n \"Orders are orders!\" Kerry Blane shrugged. He swung the cruiser in a wide arc to the north, trebling the flying  speed within minutes, handling the controls with a familiar dexterity.  He said nothing, searched the gleaming ocean for the smudge of  blackness that would denote another island. His gaze flicked amusedly,  now and then, to the lanky Splinter who scowled moodily and toyed with  the dis-gun in his long hands.\n\n\n \"Cheer up, lad,\" Kerry Blane said finally. \"I think you'll find plenty  to occupy your time shortly.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe?\" Splinter said gloomily.\n\n\n He idly swallowed another vitamin capsule, grinned, when he saw Kerry  Blane's automatic grimace of distaste. Then he yawned hugely, twisted  into a comfortable position, dozed sleepily.\n\n\n Kerry Blane rode the controls for the next three hours, searching the  limitless ocean for the few specks of islands that followed the slow  currents of the water planet. Always, there was the same misty light  surrounding the ship, never dimming, giving a sense of unreality to the  scene below. Nowhere was there the slightest sign of life until, in the  fourth hour of flight, a tiny dot of blackness came slowly over the  horizon's water line.\n\n\n Kerry Blane spun the ship in a tight circle, sent it flashing to the  west. His keen eyes lighted, when he finally made out the turtle-like  outline of the island, and he whistled softly, off-key, as he nudged  the snoring Splinter.\n\n\n \"This is it, Sleeping Beauty,\" he called. \"Snap out of it!\"\n\n\n \"Huh? Whuzzat?\" Splinter grunted, rolled to his elbow.\n\n\n \"Here's the island.\"\n\n\n \"Oh!\" Splinter swung his feet from the bunk, peered from the vision  port, sleepiness instantly erased from his face.\n\n\n \"Hot damn!\" he chortled. \"Now we'll see a little action!\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane grinned, tried to conceal the excitement he felt. He shook  his head, his fingers flickering over the control studs.\n\n\n \"Don't get your hopes too high, lad,\" he counseled. \"With those super  Zelta guns, it won't take ten minutes to wipe out that monster.\"\n\n\n Splinter rubbed his hands together, sighed like a boy seeing his first  circus. \"Listen, for ten minutes of that, I'd ride this chunk of metal  for a year!\"\n\n\n \"Could be!\" Kerry Blane agreed.\n\n\n He peered through the port, seeking any spot clear enough for a landing  field. Except for a strip of open beach, the island was a solid mass of  heavy fern-like growth.\n\n\n \"Belt yourself,\" Kerry Blane warned. \"If that beach isn't solid, I'll  have to lift the ship in a hell of a hurry.\"\n\n\n \"Right!\" Splinter's fingers were all thumbs in his excitement.\n\n\n Kerry Blane set the controls for a shallow glide, his fingers moving  like a concert pianist's. The cruiser yawed slightly, settled slowly  in a flat shallow glide.\n\n\n \"We're going in,\" Kerry Blane said quietly.\n\n\n He closed a knife switch, seeing too late the vitamin capsule that was  lodged in the slot. There was the sharp splutter of a short-circuit,  and a thin tendril of smoke drifted upward.\n\n\n \"Damn!\" Kerry Blane swore briefly.\n\n\n There was an instant, terrific explosion of the stern jets, and the  cruiser hurtled toward the beach like a gravity-crazed comet.\n\n\n Kerry Blane said absolutely nothing, his breath driven from him by the  suck of inertia. His hands darted for the controls, seeking to balance  the forces that threw the ship about like a toy. He cut all rockets  with a smashing swoop of his hand, tried to fire the bow rockets. But  the short had ruined the entire control system.\n\n\n For one interminable second, he saw the uncanny uprush of the island  below. He flicked his gaze about, saw the instant terror that wiped  all other expression from his young companion's face. Then the cruiser  plowed into the silvery sand.\n\n\n Belts parted like rotten string; they were thrown forward with crushing  force against the control panel. They groped feebly for support, their  bodies twisting involuntarily, as the ship cartwheeled a dozen times in  a few seconds. Almost instantly, consciousness was battered from them.\n\n\n With one final, grinding bounce, the cruiser rolled to its side,  twisted over and over for a hundred yards, then came to a metal-ripping  stop against a moss-grown boulder at the water's edge. III\n\n\n Kerry Blane choked, tried to turn his head from the water that trickled  into his face. He opened his eyes, stared blankly, uncomprehendingly  into the bloody features of the man bending over him.\n\n\n \"What happened?\" he gasped.\n\n\n Splinter Wood laughed, almost hysterically, mopped at his forehead with  a wet handkerchief.\n\n\n \"I thought you were dead!\" he said simply.\n\n\n Kerry Blane moved his arm experimentally, felt broken bones grate in  an exquisite wave of pain. He fought back the nausea, gazed about the  cabin, realized the ship lay on its side.\n\n\n \"Maybe I am,\" he said ruefully. \"No man could live through that crash.\"\n\n\n Splinter moved away, sat down tiredly on the edge of a bunk. He shook  his head dazedly, inspected the long cut on his leg.\n\n\n \"We seem to have done it,\" he said dully.\n\n\n Kerry Blane nodded, clambered to his feet, favoring his broken arm.  He leaned over the control panel, inspecting the dials with a worried  gaze. Slowly, his eyes lightened, and his voice was almost cheerful as  he swung about.\n\n\n \"Everything is more or less okay,\" he said. \"The board will have to  be rewired, but nothing else seems to be damaged so that repairs are  needed.\"\n\n\n Splinter looked up from his task of bandaging his leg. \"What caused  the crash?\" he asked. \"One minute, everything was all right; the next,  Blooey!\"\n\n\n Anger suddenly mottled Kerry Blane's face; he swore monotonously and  bitterly for a moment.\n\n\n \"Those gol-damned pills you been taking caused the crash!\" he roared.  \"One of them broke and shorted out the control board.\" He scowled at  the incredulous Splinter. \"By the three tails of a Martian sand-pup, I  ought to cram the rest of them down your throat, boxes and all!\"\n\n\n Splinter flushed, seemed to be fumbling for words. After a bit, Kerry  Blane grinned.\n\n\n \"Forget it, lad,\" he said more kindly, \"those things happen. Now, if  you'll bind a splint about my arm, we'll see what we can do about  righting the ship.\"\n\n\n Splinter nodded, opened the medical locker, worked with tape and  splints for minutes. Great beads of perspiration stood out in high  relief on Kerry Blane's forehead, but he made no sound. At last,  Splinter finished, tucked the supplies away.\n\n\n \"Now what?\" he asked subduedly.\n\n\n \"Let's take a look outside, maybe set up the Zelta guns. Can't tell but  what that protoplasmic nightmare might take a notion to pay us a visit  in the near future!\"\n\n\n \"Right!\" Splinter unscrewed the port cogs, swung the portal back.\n\n\n He swung lithely from the portal, reached down a hand to help the  older man. After much puffing and grunting, Kerry Blane managed to  clamber through the port. They stood for a moment in silent wonder,  staring at the long lazy rollers of milky fluorescence that rolled  endlessly toward the beach, then turned to gaze at the great fern-like  trees that towered two hundred feet into the air.\n\n\n \"How big do you feel now?\" Kerry Blane asked quietly.\n\n\n Splinter Wood was silent, awed by the beauty and the tremendous size of  the growths on the water world.\n\n\n Kerry Blane walked the length of the cruiser, examining the slight  damage done by the crash, evaluating the situation with a practiced  gaze. He nodded slowly, retraced his steps, and stood looking at the  furrow plowed in the sand.\n\n\n \"Won't be any trouble at all to lift the ship,\" he called. \"After  rewiring the board, we'll turn the ship with an underjet, swing it  about, and head her toward the sea.\"\n\n\n Splinter nodded, dropped into the open port. A moment later, he flipped  a rope ladder outside, where it dangled to the ground, then climbed out  himself, carrying the two Zelta guns.\n\n\n \"We'd better test these,\" he said. \"We don't want any slip-ups when we  do go into action.\"\n\n\n He climbed down the ladder, laid the guns aside, then reached up a  hand to aid Kerry Blane's descent. Kerry Blane came down slowly and  awkwardly, jumped the last few feet. He felt surprisingly light and  strong in the lesser gravity.\n\n\n He stood, leaning against the ship, watching as Splinter picked up  the first gun and leveled it at a gigantic tree. Splinter sighted  carefully, winked at the older man, then pressed the firing stud.\n\n\n Nothing happened; there was no hissing crackle of released energy.\n\n\n Kerry Blane strode forward, puzzlement on his lined face, his hand  out-stretched toward the defective weapon. Splinter gaped at the gun in  his hands, held it out wordlessly.\n\n\n \"The crash must have broken something,\" Kerry Blane said slowly.\n\n\n Splinter shook his head. \"There's only one moving part,\" he said, \"and  that's the force gate on the firing stud.\"\n\n\n \"Try the other,\" Kerry Blane said slowly.\n\n\n \"Okay!\"\n\n\n Splinter lifted the second gun, pressed the stud, gazed white-faced at  his companion.\n\n\n \"It won't work, either,\" he said stupidly. \"I don't get it? The source  of power is limitless. Solar rays never\u2014\"\n\n\n Old Kerry Blane dropped the first gun to his side, swore harshly.\n\n\n \"Damn it,\" he said. \"They didn't think of it; you didn't think of it;  and I most certainly forgot! Solar rays can't penetrate the miles of  clouds on Venus. Those guns are utterly useless as weapons!\" ",

PEACOCK The orders were explicit: \"Destroy the\n\n 'THING' of Venus.\" But Patrolmen Kerry\n\n Blane and Splinter Wood, their space-ship\n\n wrecked, could not follow orders\u2014their\n\n weapons were useless on the Water-world.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Winter 1942.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Old Kerry Blane exploded.\n\n\n \"Damn it!\" he roared. \"I don't like you; and I don't like this ship;  and I don't like the assignment; and I don't like those infernal pills  you keep eating; and I\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Splinter\" Wood grinned.\n\n\n \"Seems to me, Kerry,\" he remarked humorously, \"that you don't like much  of anything!\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane growled unintelligibly, batted the injector lever with a  calloused hand. His grizzled hair was a stiff wiry mop on his small  head, and his oversize jaw was thrust belligerently forward. But deep  within his eyes, where he hoped it was hidden, was a friendly twinkle  that gave the lie to his speech.\n\n\n \"You're a squirt!\" he snapped disagreeably. \"You're not dry behind  the ears, yet. You're like the rest of these kids who call themselves  pilots\u2014only more so! And why the hell the chief had to sic you on me,  on an exploration trip this important\u2014well, I'll never understand.\"\n\n\n Splinter rolled his six foot three of lanky body into a more  comfortable position on the air-bunk. He yawned tremendously, fumbled a  small box from his shirt pocket, and removed a marble-like capsule.\n\n\n \"Better take one of these,\" he warned. \"You're liable to get the space  bends at any moment.\"\n\n\n Old Kerry Blane snorted, batted the box aside impatiently, scowled  moodily at the capsules that bounced for a moment against the pilot  room's walls before hanging motionless in the air.\n\n\n \"Mister Wood,\" he said icily, \"I was flying a space ship while they  were changing your pants twenty times a day. When I want advice on how  to fly a ship, how to cure space bends, how to handle a Zelta ray, or  how to spit\u2014I'll ask you! Until then, you and your bloody marbles can  go plumb straight to the devil!\"\n\n\n \"Tsk! Tsk! Tsk!\" Splinter reached out lazily, plucked the capsules from  the air, one by one.\n\n\n Kerry Blane lit one of the five allotted cigarettes of the day.\n\n\n \"Don't 'tsk' me, you young squirt,\" he grunted around a mouthful of  fragrant smoke. \"I know all the arguments you can put up; ain't that  all I been hearing for a week? You take your vitamins A, B, C, D, all  you want, but you leave me alone\u2014or I'll stuff your head down your  throat, P.D.Q.!\"\n\n\n \"All right, all right!\" Splinter tucked the capsule box back into his  pocket, grinned mockingly. \"But don't say I didn't warn you. With this  shielded ship, and with no sunlight reaching Venus' surface, you're  gonna be begging for some of my vitamin, super-concentrated pills  before we get back to Earth.\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane made a rich, ripe noise with his mouth.\n\n\n \"Pfuii!\" he said very distinctly.\n\n\n \"Gracious!\" Splinter said in mock horror. They made a strange contrast as they lay in their air bunks. Splinter  was fully a head taller than the dour Irishman, and his lanky build  gave a false impression of awkwardness. While the vitriolic Kerry Blane  was short and compact, strength and quickness evident in every movement.\n\n\n Kerry Blane had flown every type of ship that rode in space. In the  passing years, he had flight-tested almost every new experimental ship,  had flown them with increasing skill, had earned a reputation as a  trouble shooter on any kind of craft.\n\n\n But even Kerry Blane had to retire eventually.\n\n\n A great retirement banquet had been given in his honor by the  Interplanetary Squadron. There had been the usual speeches and  presentations; and Kerry Blane had heard them all, had thanked the  donors of the gifts. But it was not until the next morning, when he was  dressed in civilian clothes for the first time in forty years, that he  realized the enormity of the thing that had happened to his life.\n\n\n Something died within Kerry Blane's heart that morning, shriveled and  passed away, leaving him suddenly shrunken and old. He had become like  a rusty old freighter couched between the gleaming bodies of great  space warriors.\n\n\n Finally, as a last resort so that he would not be thrown entirely  aside, he had taken a desk job in the squadron offices. For six years  he had dry-rotted there, waiting hopefully for the moment when his  active services would be needed again.\n\n\n It was there that he had met and liked the ungainly Splinter Wood.  There was something in the boy that had found a kindred spirit in Kerry  Blane's heart, and he had taken the youngster in hand to give him the  benefits of experience that had become legendary.\n\n\n Splinter Wood was a probationary pilot, had been admitted to the  Interplanetary Squadron because of his inherent skill, even though his  formal education had been fairly well neglected. Now, the two of them rode the pounding jets of a DX cruiser, bound  for Venus to make a personal survey of its floating islands for the  Interplanetary Squadron's Medical Division.\n\n\n \"Ten to one we don't get back!\" Splinter said pessimistically.\n\n\n Kerry Blane scrubbed out his cigarette, scowled bleakly at the  instrument panel. He sensed the faint thread of fear in the youngster's  tone, and a nostalgic twinge touched his heart, for he was remembering  the days of his youth when he had a full life to look forward to.\n\n\n \"If you're afraid, you can get out and walk back,\" he snapped  disagreeably.\n\n\n A grin lifted the corners of Splinter's long mouth, spread into his  eyes. His hand unconsciously came up, touched the tiny squadron pin on  his lapel.\n\n\n \"Sorry to disappoint you, glory grabber,\" he said mockingly, \"but I've  got definite orders to take care of you.\"\n\n\n \" Me! You've got orders to take care of me ?\" Kerry Blane choked  incoherently for a moment, red tiding cholerically upward from his  loosened collar.\n\n\n \"Of course!\" Splinter grinned.\n\n\n Kerry Blane exploded, words spewing volcanically forth. Splinter  relaxed, his booted foot beating out a dull rhythm to the colorful  language learned through almost fifty years of spacing. And at last,  when Kerry Blane had quieted until he but smoldered, he leaned over and  touched the old spacer on the sleeve.\n\n\n \"Seventy-eight!\" he remarked pleasantly.\n\n\n \"Seventy-eight what?\" Kerry Blane asked sullenly, the old twinkle  beginning to light again deep in his eyes.\n\n\n \"Seventy-eight new words\u2014and you swore them beautifully!\" Splinter  beamed. \"Some day you can teach them to me.\"\n\n\n They laughed then, Old Kerry Blane and young Splinter Wood, and  the warmth of their friendship was a tangible thing in the small  control-room of the cruiser.\n\n\n And in the midst of their laughter, Old Kerry Blane choked in agony,  surged desperately against his bunk straps.\n\n\n He screamed unknowingly, feeling only the horrible excruciating agony  of his body, tasting the blood that gushed from his mouth and nostrils.  His muscles were knotted cords that he could not loosen, and his blood  was a surging stream that pounded at his throbbing temples. The air he  breathed seemed to be molten flame.\n\n\n His body arced again and again against the restraining straps, and his  mouth was open in a soundless scream. He sensed dimly that his partner  had wrenched open a wall door, removed metal medicine kits, and was  fumbling through their contents. He felt the bite of the hypodermic,  felt a deadly numbness replace the raging torment that had been his  for seconds. He swallowed three capsules automatically, passed into a  coma-like sleep, woke hours later to stare clear-eyed into Splinter's  concerned face.\n\n\n \"Close, wasn't it?\" he said weakly, conversationally.\n\n\n \"Close enough!\" Splinter agreed relievedly. \"If you had followed my  advice and taken those vitamin capsules, you'd never have had the  bends.\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane grinned, winced when he felt the dull ache in his body.\n\n\n \"I've had the bends before, and lived through them!\" he said, still  weakly defiant.\n\n\n \"That's the past,\" Splinter said quietly. \"This is the present, and you  take your pills every day, just as I do\u2014from now on.\"\n\n\n \"All right\u2014and thanks!\"\n\n\n \"Forget it!\" Splinter flushed in quick embarrassment.\n\n\n A buzzer sounded from the instrument panel, and a tiny light glowed  redly.\n\n\n \"Six hours more,\" Splinter said, turned to the instrument panel.\n\n\n His long hands played over the instrument panel, checking, controlling  the rocket fire, adjusting delicate instruments to hairline marks.  Kerry Blane nodded in silent approval.\n\n\n They could feel the first tug of gravity on their bodies, and through  the vision port could see the greenish ball that was cloud-covered  Venus. Excitement lifted their spirits, brought light to their eyes as  they peered eagerly ahead.\n\n\n \"What's it really like?\" Splinter asked impatiently.\n\n\n Kerry Blane yawned, settled back luxuriously. \"I'll tell you later,\" he  said, \"I'm going to take a nap and try to ease this bellyache of mine.  Wake me up so that I can take over, when we land; Venus is a tricky  place to set a ship on.\"\n\n\n He yawned again, drifted instantly into sleep, relaxing with the  ability of a spaceman who sleeps when and if he can. Splinter smiled  down at his sleeping partner, then turned back to the quartzite port.  He shook his head a bit, remembering the stories he had heard about the  water planet, wondering\u2014wondering\u2014 II\n\n\n Venus was a fluffy cotton ball hanging motionless in bottomless  space. Far to the left, Mercury gleamed like a polished diamond in  the sunlight. Kerry Blane cut the driving rockets, let the cruiser  sink into a fast gravity-dive, guiding it only now and then by a brief  flicker of a side jet.\n\n\n Splinter Wood watched breathlessly from the vision port, his long face  eager and reckless, his eyes seeking to pierce the clouds that roiled  and twisted uneasily over the surface of the planet.\n\n\n Kerry Blane glanced tolerantly at his young companion, felt a nostalgic  tug at his heart when he remembered the first time he had approached  the water-planet years before. Then, he had been a young and reckless  firebrand, his fame already spreading, an unquenchable fire of  adventure flaming in his heart.\n\n\n Now, his aged but steady fingers rested lightly on the controls,  brought the patrol cruiser closer to the cloud-banks on the line of  demarcation between the sunward and sunless sides of the planet. He  hummed tunelessly, strangely happy, as he peered ahead.\n\n\n \"Val Kenton died there,\" Splinter whispered softly, \"Died to save the  lives of three other people!\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane nodded. \"Yes,\" he agreed, and his voice changed subtly.  \"Val was a blackguard, a criminal; but he died in the best traditions  of the service.\" He sighed. \"He never had a chance.\"\n\n\n \"Murdered!\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane smiled grimly. \"I guess I used too broad an interpretation  of the word,\" he said gently. \"Anyway, one of our main tasks is to  destroy the thing that killed him.\"\n\n\n His lean fingers tightened unconsciously.\n\n\n \"I'd like nothing better than to turn a Zelta-blaster on that chunk of  living protoplasm and cremate it.\"\n\n\n Splinters shivered slightly. \"Do you think we'll find it?\" he asked.\n\n\n Kerry Blane nodded. \"I think it will find us; after all, it's just an  animated appetite looking for food.\"\n\n\n He turned back to the controls, flipped a switch, and the cutting of  the nose rocket dropped the ship in an angling glide toward the clouds  a few miles below. Gravity was full strength now, and although not as  great as Earth's, was still strong enough to bring a sense of giddiness  to the men.\n\n\n \"Here we go!\" Splinter said tonelessly.\n\n\n The great cottony batts of roiling clouds rushed up to meet the ship,  bringing the first sense of violent movement in more than a week of  flying. There was something awesome and breath-taking in the speed with  which the ship dropped toward the planet.\n\n\n Tendrils of vapor touched the ports, were whipped aside, then were  replaced by heavier fingers of cloud. Kerry Blane pressed a firing  stud, and nose rockets thrummed in a rising crescendo as the free fall  of the cruiser was checked. Heat rose in the cabin from the friction of  the outer air, then dissipated, as the force-screen voltometer leaped  higher.\n\n\n Then, as though it had never been, the sun disappeared, and there was  only a gray blankness pressing about the ship. Gone was all sense of  movement, and the ship seemed to hover in a gray nothingness.\n\n\n Kerry Blane crouched over the control panel, his hands moving deftly,  his eyes flicking from one instrument to another. Tiny lines of  concentration etched themselves about his mouth, and perspiration  beaded his forehead. He rode that cruiser through the miles of clouds  through sheer instinctive ability, seeming to fly it as though he were  an integral part of the ship.\n\n\n Splinter Wood watched him with awe in his eyes, seeing for the first  time the incredible instinct that had made Kerry Blane the idol of a  billion people. He relaxed visibly, all instinctive fear allayed by the  brilliant competence of his companion.\n\n\n Seconds flowed into moments, and the moments merged into one another,  and still the clouds pressed with a visible strength against the  ports. The rockets drummed steadily, holding the ship aloft, dropping  it slowly toward the planet below. Then the clouds thinned, and,  incredibly, were permeated with a dim and glowing light. A second  later, and the clouds were gone, and a thousand feet below tumbled and  tossed in a majestic display of ruthless strength an ocean that seemed  to be composed of liquid fluorescence.\n\n\n Kerry Blane heard Splinter's instant sigh of unbelief.\n\n\n \"Good Lord!\" Splinter said, \"What\u2014\"\n\n\n His voice stilled, and he was silent, his eyes drinking in the weird  incredible scene below. The ocean was a shifting, white-capped wash of silvery light that  gleamed with a bright phosphorescence of a hundred, intermingled,  kaleidoscopic colors. And the unreal, unearthly light continued  unbroken everywhere, reflected from the low-hanging clouds, reaching  to the far horizon, bathing every detail of the planet in a brilliance  more bright than moonlight.\n\n\n Splinter turned a wondering face. \"But the official reports say that  there is no light on Venus,\" he exclaimed. \"That was one of the reasons  given when exploration was forbidden!\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane nodded. \"That was merely a pretext to keep foolhardy  spacemen from losing their lives on the planet. In reality, the  ocean is alive with an incredibly tiny marine worm that glows  phosphorescently. The light generated from those billions of worms is  reflected back from the clouds, makes Venus eternally lighted.\"\n\n\n He turned the ship to the North, relaxed a bit on the air bunk. He  felt tired and worn, his body aching from the space bends of a few  hours before.\n\n\n \"Take over,\" he said wearily. \"Take the ship North, and watch for any  island.\"\n\n\n Splinter nodded, rested his long hands on the controls. The space  cruiser lifted a bit in a sudden spurt of speed, and the rocket-sound  was a solid thrum of unleashed power.\n\n\n Kerry Blane lit a cigarette, leaned toward a vision port. He felt again  that thrill he had experienced when he had first flashed his single-man  cruiser through the clouds years before. Then the breath caught in his  throat, and he tapped his companion's arm.\n\n\n \"Take a look!\" he called excitedly.\n\n\n They fought in the ocean below, fought in a never-ending splashing of  what seemed to be liquid fire. It was like watching a tri-dim screen of  a news event, except for the utter lack of sound.\n\n\n One was scaly, while the other was skinned, and both were fully three  hundred feet long. Great scimitars of teeth flashed in the light, and  blood gouted and stained the water crimson whenever a slashing blow was  struck. They threshed in a mad paroxysm of rage, whirling and spinning  in the phosphorescent water like beings from a nightmare, exploding  out of their element time and again, only to fall back in a gargantuan  spray of fluorescence.\n\n\n And then the scaly monster flashed in a half-turn, drove forward with  jaws agape, wrenched and ripped at the smooth black throat of the other  creature. The second creature rippled and undulated in agony, whipping  the ocean to foam, then went limp. The victorious monster circled the  body of its dead foe, then, majestically, plunged from sight into the  ocean's depths. An instant later, the water frothed, as hundreds of  lesser marine monsters attacked and fed on the floating corpse.\n\n\n \"Brrrr!\" Splinter shivered in sudden horror.\n\n\n Kerry Blane chuckled dryly. \"Feel like going for a swim?\" he asked  conversationally.\n\n\n Splinter shook his head, watched the scene disappear from view to the  rear of the line of flight, then sank back onto his bunk.\n\n\n \"Not me!\" he said deprecatingly.\n\n\n Kerry Blane chuckled again, swung the cruiser toward the tiny smudge of  black on the horizon. Glowing water flashed beneath the ship, seeming  to smooth into a gleaming mirror shot with dancing colors. There was no  sign of life anywhere.\n\n\n Thirty minutes later, Kerry Blane circled the island that floated  free in the phosphorescent ocean. His keen eyes searched the tangled  luxuriant growth of the jungle below, searching for some indication  that the protoplasmic monster he seeked was there.\n\n\n \"I don't see anything suspicious,\" Splinter contributed.\n\n\n \"There's nothing special to see,\" Kerry Blane said shortly. \"As I  understand it, anyway, this chunk of animated appetite hangs around an  island shaped like a turtle. However, our orders are to investigate  every island, just in case there might be more than one of the  monsters.\"\n\n\n Splinter buckled on his dis-gun, excitement flaring in his eyes.\n\n\n \"Let's do a little exploring?\" he said eagerly.\n\n\n Kerry Blane shook his head, swung the cruiser north again.\n\n\n \"Plenty of time for that later,\" he said mildly. \"We'll find this  turtle-island, make a landing, and take a look around. Later, if we're  lucky enough to blow our objective to Kingdom Come, we'll do a little  exploring of the other islands.\"\n\n\n \"Hell!\" Splinter scowled in mock disgust. \"An old woman like you should  be taking in knitting for a living!\"\n\n\n \"Orders are orders!\" Kerry Blane shrugged. He swung the cruiser in a wide arc to the north, trebling the flying  speed within minutes, handling the controls with a familiar dexterity.  He said nothing, searched the gleaming ocean for the smudge of  blackness that would denote another island. His gaze flicked amusedly,  now and then, to the lanky Splinter who scowled moodily and toyed with  the dis-gun in his long hands.\n\n\n \"Cheer up, lad,\" Kerry Blane said finally. \"I think you'll find plenty  to occupy your time shortly.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe?\" Splinter said gloomily.\n\n\n He idly swallowed another vitamin capsule, grinned, when he saw Kerry  Blane's automatic grimace of distaste. Then he yawned hugely, twisted  into a comfortable position, dozed sleepily.\n\n\n Kerry Blane rode the controls for the next three hours, searching the  limitless ocean for the few specks of islands that followed the slow  currents of the water planet. Always, there was the same misty light  surrounding the ship, never dimming, giving a sense of unreality to the  scene below. Nowhere was there the slightest sign of life until, in the  fourth hour of flight, a tiny dot of blackness came slowly over the  horizon's water line.\n\n\n Kerry Blane spun the ship in a tight circle, sent it flashing to the  west. His keen eyes lighted, when he finally made out the turtle-like  outline of the island, and he whistled softly, off-key, as he nudged  the snoring Splinter.\n\n\n \"This is it, Sleeping Beauty,\" he called. \"Snap out of it!\"\n\n\n \"Huh? Whuzzat?\" Splinter grunted, rolled to his elbow.\n\n\n \"Here's the island.\"\n\n\n \"Oh!\" Splinter swung his feet from the bunk, peered from the vision  port, sleepiness instantly erased from his face.\n\n\n \"Hot damn!\" he chortled. \"Now we'll see a little action!\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane grinned, tried to conceal the excitement he felt. He shook  his head, his fingers flickering over the control studs.\n\n\n \"Don't get your hopes too high, lad,\" he counseled. \"With those super  Zelta guns, it won't take ten minutes to wipe out that monster.\"\n\n\n Splinter rubbed his hands together, sighed like a boy seeing his first  circus. \"Listen, for ten minutes of that, I'd ride this chunk of metal  for a year!\"\n\n\n \"Could be!\" Kerry Blane agreed.\n\n\n He peered through the port, seeking any spot clear enough for a landing  field. Except for a strip of open beach, the island was a solid mass of  heavy fern-like growth.\n\n\n \"Belt yourself,\" Kerry Blane warned. \"If that beach isn't solid, I'll  have to lift the ship in a hell of a hurry.\"\n\n\n \"Right!\" Splinter's fingers were all thumbs in his excitement.\n\n\n Kerry Blane set the controls for a shallow glide, his fingers moving  like a concert pianist's. The cruiser yawed slightly, settled slowly  in a flat shallow glide.\n\n\n \"We're going in,\" Kerry Blane said quietly.\n\n\n He closed a knife switch, seeing too late the vitamin capsule that was  lodged in the slot. There was the sharp splutter of a short-circuit,  and a thin tendril of smoke drifted upward.\n\n\n \"Damn!\" Kerry Blane swore briefly.\n\n\n There was an instant, terrific explosion of the stern jets, and the  cruiser hurtled toward the beach like a gravity-crazed comet.\n\n\n Kerry Blane said absolutely nothing, his breath driven from him by the  suck of inertia. His hands darted for the controls, seeking to balance  the forces that threw the ship about like a toy. He cut all rockets  with a smashing swoop of his hand, tried to fire the bow rockets. But  the short had ruined the entire control system.\n\n\n For one interminable second, he saw the uncanny uprush of the island  below. He flicked his gaze about, saw the instant terror that wiped  all other expression from his young companion's face. Then the cruiser  plowed into the silvery sand.\n\n\n Belts parted like rotten string; they were thrown forward with crushing  force against the control panel. They groped feebly for support, their  bodies twisting involuntarily, as the ship cartwheeled a dozen times in  a few seconds. Almost instantly, consciousness was battered from them.\n\n\n With one final, grinding bounce, the cruiser rolled to its side,  twisted over and over for a hundred yards, then came to a metal-ripping  stop against a moss-grown boulder at the water's edge. III\n\n\n Kerry Blane choked, tried to turn his head from the water that trickled  into his face. He opened his eyes, stared blankly, uncomprehendingly  into the bloody features of the man bending over him.\n\n\n \"What happened?\" he gasped.\n\n\n Splinter Wood laughed, almost hysterically, mopped at his forehead with  a wet handkerchief.\n\n\n \"I thought you were dead!\" he said simply.\n\n\n Kerry Blane moved his arm experimentally, felt broken bones grate in  an exquisite wave of pain. He fought back the nausea, gazed about the  cabin, realized the ship lay on its side.\n\n\n \"Maybe I am,\" he said ruefully. \"No man could live through that crash.\"\n\n\n Splinter moved away, sat down tiredly on the edge of a bunk. He shook  his head dazedly, inspected the long cut on his leg.\n\n\n \"We seem to have done it,\" he said dully.\n\n\n Kerry Blane nodded, clambered to his feet, favoring his broken arm.  He leaned over the control panel, inspecting the dials with a worried  gaze. Slowly, his eyes lightened, and his voice was almost cheerful as  he swung about.\n\n\n \"Everything is more or less okay,\" he said. \"The board will have to  be rewired, but nothing else seems to be damaged so that repairs are  needed.\"\n\n\n Splinter looked up from his task of bandaging his leg. \"What caused  the crash?\" he asked. \"One minute, everything was all right; the next,  Blooey!\"\n\n\n Anger suddenly mottled Kerry Blane's face; he swore monotonously and  bitterly for a moment.\n\n\n \"Those gol-damned pills you been taking caused the crash!\" he roared.  \"One of them broke and shorted out the control board.\" He scowled at  the incredulous Splinter. \"By the three tails of a Martian sand-pup, I  ought to cram the rest of them down your throat, boxes and all!\"\n\n\n Splinter flushed, seemed to be fumbling for words. After a bit, Kerry  Blane grinned.\n\n\n \"Forget it, lad,\" he said more kindly, \"those things happen. Now, if  you'll bind a splint about my arm, we'll see what we can do about  righting the ship.\"\n\n\n Splinter nodded, opened the medical locker, worked with tape and  splints for minutes. Great beads of perspiration stood out in high  relief on Kerry Blane's forehead, but he made no sound. At last,  Splinter finished, tucked the supplies away.\n\n\n \"Now what?\" he asked subduedly.\n\n\n \"Let's take a look outside, maybe set up the Zelta guns. Can't tell but  what that protoplasmic nightmare might take a notion to pay us a visit  in the near future!\"\n\n\n \"Right!\" Splinter unscrewed the port cogs, swung the portal back.\n\n\n He swung lithely from the portal, reached down a hand to help the  older man. After much puffing and grunting, Kerry Blane managed to  clamber through the port. They stood for a moment in silent wonder,  staring at the long lazy rollers of milky fluorescence that rolled  endlessly toward the beach, then turned to gaze at the great fern-like  trees that towered two hundred feet into the air.\n\n\n \"How big do you feel now?\" Kerry Blane asked quietly.\n\n\n Splinter Wood was silent, awed by the beauty and the tremendous size of  the growths on the water world.\n\n\n Kerry Blane walked the length of the cruiser, examining the slight  damage done by the crash, evaluating the situation with a practiced  gaze. He nodded slowly, retraced his steps, and stood looking at the  furrow plowed in the sand.\n\n\n \"Won't be any trouble at all to lift the ship,\" he called. \"After  rewiring the board, we'll turn the ship with an underjet, swing it  about, and head her toward the sea.\"\n\n\n Splinter nodded, dropped into the open port. A moment later, he flipped  a rope ladder outside, where it dangled to the ground, then climbed out  himself, carrying the two Zelta guns.\n\n\n \"We'd better test these,\" he said. \"We don't want any slip-ups when we  do go into action.\"\n\n\n He climbed down the ladder, laid the guns aside, then reached up a  hand to aid Kerry Blane's descent. Kerry Blane came down slowly and  awkwardly, jumped the last few feet. He felt surprisingly light and  strong in the lesser gravity.\n\n\n He stood, leaning against the ship, watching as Splinter picked up  the first gun and leveled it at a gigantic tree. Splinter sighted  carefully, winked at the older man, then pressed the firing stud.\n\n\n Nothing happened; there was no hissing crackle of released energy.\n\n\n Kerry Blane strode forward, puzzlement on his lined face, his hand  out-stretched toward the defective weapon. Splinter gaped at the gun in  his hands, held it out wordlessly.\n\n\n \"The crash must have broken something,\" Kerry Blane said slowly.\n\n\n Splinter shook his head. \"There's only one moving part,\" he said, \"and  that's the force gate on the firing stud.\"\n\n\n \"Try the other,\" Kerry Blane said slowly.\n\n\n \"Okay!\"\n\n\n Splinter lifted the second gun, pressed the stud, gazed white-faced at  his companion.\n\n\n \"It won't work, either,\" he said stupidly. \"I don't get it? The source  of power is limitless. Solar rays never\u2014\"\n\n\n Old Kerry Blane dropped the first gun to his side, swore harshly.\n\n\n \"Damn it,\" he said. \"They didn't think of it; you didn't think of it;  and I most certainly forgot! Solar rays can't penetrate the miles of  clouds on Venus. Those guns are utterly useless as weapons!\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow did Splinter feel about being with Kerry on the turtle-shaped island?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Relieved to have his experience at hand\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Pitiful that he had broken his arm\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Pitiful that he had broken his arm\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Pitiful that he had broken his arm\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

PEACOCK The orders were explicit: \"Destroy the\n\n 'THING' of Venus.\" But Patrolmen Kerry\n\n Blane and Splinter Wood, their space-ship\n\n wrecked, could not follow orders\u2014their\n\n weapons were useless on the Water-world.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Winter 1942.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Old Kerry Blane exploded.\n\n\n \"Damn it!\" he roared. \"I don't like you; and I don't like this ship;  and I don't like the assignment; and I don't like those infernal pills  you keep eating; and I\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Splinter\" Wood grinned.\n\n\n \"Seems to me, Kerry,\" he remarked humorously, \"that you don't like much  of anything!\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane growled unintelligibly, batted the injector lever with a  calloused hand. His grizzled hair was a stiff wiry mop on his small  head, and his oversize jaw was thrust belligerently forward. But deep  within his eyes, where he hoped it was hidden, was a friendly twinkle  that gave the lie to his speech.\n\n\n \"You're a squirt!\" he snapped disagreeably. \"You're not dry behind  the ears, yet. You're like the rest of these kids who call themselves  pilots\u2014only more so! And why the hell the chief had to sic you on me,  on an exploration trip this important\u2014well, I'll never understand.\"\n\n\n Splinter rolled his six foot three of lanky body into a more  comfortable position on the air-bunk. He yawned tremendously, fumbled a  small box from his shirt pocket, and removed a marble-like capsule.\n\n\n \"Better take one of these,\" he warned. \"You're liable to get the space  bends at any moment.\"\n\n\n Old Kerry Blane snorted, batted the box aside impatiently, scowled  moodily at the capsules that bounced for a moment against the pilot  room's walls before hanging motionless in the air.\n\n\n \"Mister Wood,\" he said icily, \"I was flying a space ship while they  were changing your pants twenty times a day. When I want advice on how  to fly a ship, how to cure space bends, how to handle a Zelta ray, or  how to spit\u2014I'll ask you! Until then, you and your bloody marbles can  go plumb straight to the devil!\"\n\n\n \"Tsk! Tsk! Tsk!\" Splinter reached out lazily, plucked the capsules from  the air, one by one.\n\n\n Kerry Blane lit one of the five allotted cigarettes of the day.\n\n\n \"Don't 'tsk' me, you young squirt,\" he grunted around a mouthful of  fragrant smoke. \"I know all the arguments you can put up; ain't that  all I been hearing for a week? You take your vitamins A, B, C, D, all  you want, but you leave me alone\u2014or I'll stuff your head down your  throat, P.D.Q.!\"\n\n\n \"All right, all right!\" Splinter tucked the capsule box back into his  pocket, grinned mockingly. \"But don't say I didn't warn you. With this  shielded ship, and with no sunlight reaching Venus' surface, you're  gonna be begging for some of my vitamin, super-concentrated pills  before we get back to Earth.\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane made a rich, ripe noise with his mouth.\n\n\n \"Pfuii!\" he said very distinctly.\n\n\n \"Gracious!\" Splinter said in mock horror. They made a strange contrast as they lay in their air bunks. Splinter  was fully a head taller than the dour Irishman, and his lanky build  gave a false impression of awkwardness. While the vitriolic Kerry Blane  was short and compact, strength and quickness evident in every movement.\n\n\n Kerry Blane had flown every type of ship that rode in space. In the  passing years, he had flight-tested almost every new experimental ship,  had flown them with increasing skill, had earned a reputation as a  trouble shooter on any kind of craft.\n\n\n But even Kerry Blane had to retire eventually.\n\n\n A great retirement banquet had been given in his honor by the  Interplanetary Squadron. There had been the usual speeches and  presentations; and Kerry Blane had heard them all, had thanked the  donors of the gifts. But it was not until the next morning, when he was  dressed in civilian clothes for the first time in forty years, that he  realized the enormity of the thing that had happened to his life.\n\n\n Something died within Kerry Blane's heart that morning, shriveled and  passed away, leaving him suddenly shrunken and old. He had become like  a rusty old freighter couched between the gleaming bodies of great  space warriors.\n\n\n Finally, as a last resort so that he would not be thrown entirely  aside, he had taken a desk job in the squadron offices. For six years  he had dry-rotted there, waiting hopefully for the moment when his  active services would be needed again.\n\n\n It was there that he had met and liked the ungainly Splinter Wood.  There was something in the boy that had found a kindred spirit in Kerry  Blane's heart, and he had taken the youngster in hand to give him the  benefits of experience that had become legendary.\n\n\n Splinter Wood was a probationary pilot, had been admitted to the  Interplanetary Squadron because of his inherent skill, even though his  formal education had been fairly well neglected. Now, the two of them rode the pounding jets of a DX cruiser, bound  for Venus to make a personal survey of its floating islands for the  Interplanetary Squadron's Medical Division.\n\n\n \"Ten to one we don't get back!\" Splinter said pessimistically.\n\n\n Kerry Blane scrubbed out his cigarette, scowled bleakly at the  instrument panel. He sensed the faint thread of fear in the youngster's  tone, and a nostalgic twinge touched his heart, for he was remembering  the days of his youth when he had a full life to look forward to.\n\n\n \"If you're afraid, you can get out and walk back,\" he snapped  disagreeably.\n\n\n A grin lifted the corners of Splinter's long mouth, spread into his  eyes. His hand unconsciously came up, touched the tiny squadron pin on  his lapel.\n\n\n \"Sorry to disappoint you, glory grabber,\" he said mockingly, \"but I've  got definite orders to take care of you.\"\n\n\n \" Me! You've got orders to take care of me ?\" Kerry Blane choked  incoherently for a moment, red tiding cholerically upward from his  loosened collar.\n\n\n \"Of course!\" Splinter grinned.\n\n\n Kerry Blane exploded, words spewing volcanically forth. Splinter  relaxed, his booted foot beating out a dull rhythm to the colorful  language learned through almost fifty years of spacing. And at last,  when Kerry Blane had quieted until he but smoldered, he leaned over and  touched the old spacer on the sleeve.\n\n\n \"Seventy-eight!\" he remarked pleasantly.\n\n\n \"Seventy-eight what?\" Kerry Blane asked sullenly, the old twinkle  beginning to light again deep in his eyes.\n\n\n \"Seventy-eight new words\u2014and you swore them beautifully!\" Splinter  beamed. \"Some day you can teach them to me.\"\n\n\n They laughed then, Old Kerry Blane and young Splinter Wood, and  the warmth of their friendship was a tangible thing in the small  control-room of the cruiser.\n\n\n And in the midst of their laughter, Old Kerry Blane choked in agony,  surged desperately against his bunk straps.\n\n\n He screamed unknowingly, feeling only the horrible excruciating agony  of his body, tasting the blood that gushed from his mouth and nostrils.  His muscles were knotted cords that he could not loosen, and his blood  was a surging stream that pounded at his throbbing temples. The air he  breathed seemed to be molten flame.\n\n\n His body arced again and again against the restraining straps, and his  mouth was open in a soundless scream. He sensed dimly that his partner  had wrenched open a wall door, removed metal medicine kits, and was  fumbling through their contents. He felt the bite of the hypodermic,  felt a deadly numbness replace the raging torment that had been his  for seconds. He swallowed three capsules automatically, passed into a  coma-like sleep, woke hours later to stare clear-eyed into Splinter's  concerned face.\n\n\n \"Close, wasn't it?\" he said weakly, conversationally.\n\n\n \"Close enough!\" Splinter agreed relievedly. \"If you had followed my  advice and taken those vitamin capsules, you'd never have had the  bends.\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane grinned, winced when he felt the dull ache in his body.\n\n\n \"I've had the bends before, and lived through them!\" he said, still  weakly defiant.\n\n\n \"That's the past,\" Splinter said quietly. \"This is the present, and you  take your pills every day, just as I do\u2014from now on.\"\n\n\n \"All right\u2014and thanks!\"\n\n\n \"Forget it!\" Splinter flushed in quick embarrassment.\n\n\n A buzzer sounded from the instrument panel, and a tiny light glowed  redly.\n\n\n \"Six hours more,\" Splinter said, turned to the instrument panel.\n\n\n His long hands played over the instrument panel, checking, controlling  the rocket fire, adjusting delicate instruments to hairline marks.  Kerry Blane nodded in silent approval.\n\n\n They could feel the first tug of gravity on their bodies, and through  the vision port could see the greenish ball that was cloud-covered  Venus. Excitement lifted their spirits, brought light to their eyes as  they peered eagerly ahead.\n\n\n \"What's it really like?\" Splinter asked impatiently.\n\n\n Kerry Blane yawned, settled back luxuriously. \"I'll tell you later,\" he  said, \"I'm going to take a nap and try to ease this bellyache of mine.  Wake me up so that I can take over, when we land; Venus is a tricky  place to set a ship on.\"\n\n\n He yawned again, drifted instantly into sleep, relaxing with the  ability of a spaceman who sleeps when and if he can. Splinter smiled  down at his sleeping partner, then turned back to the quartzite port.  He shook his head a bit, remembering the stories he had heard about the  water planet, wondering\u2014wondering\u2014 II\n\n\n Venus was a fluffy cotton ball hanging motionless in bottomless  space. Far to the left, Mercury gleamed like a polished diamond in  the sunlight. Kerry Blane cut the driving rockets, let the cruiser  sink into a fast gravity-dive, guiding it only now and then by a brief  flicker of a side jet.\n\n\n Splinter Wood watched breathlessly from the vision port, his long face  eager and reckless, his eyes seeking to pierce the clouds that roiled  and twisted uneasily over the surface of the planet.\n\n\n Kerry Blane glanced tolerantly at his young companion, felt a nostalgic  tug at his heart when he remembered the first time he had approached  the water-planet years before. Then, he had been a young and reckless  firebrand, his fame already spreading, an unquenchable fire of  adventure flaming in his heart.\n\n\n Now, his aged but steady fingers rested lightly on the controls,  brought the patrol cruiser closer to the cloud-banks on the line of  demarcation between the sunward and sunless sides of the planet. He  hummed tunelessly, strangely happy, as he peered ahead.\n\n\n \"Val Kenton died there,\" Splinter whispered softly, \"Died to save the  lives of three other people!\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane nodded. \"Yes,\" he agreed, and his voice changed subtly.  \"Val was a blackguard, a criminal; but he died in the best traditions  of the service.\" He sighed. \"He never had a chance.\"\n\n\n \"Murdered!\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane smiled grimly. \"I guess I used too broad an interpretation  of the word,\" he said gently. \"Anyway, one of our main tasks is to  destroy the thing that killed him.\"\n\n\n His lean fingers tightened unconsciously.\n\n\n \"I'd like nothing better than to turn a Zelta-blaster on that chunk of  living protoplasm and cremate it.\"\n\n\n Splinters shivered slightly. \"Do you think we'll find it?\" he asked.\n\n\n Kerry Blane nodded. \"I think it will find us; after all, it's just an  animated appetite looking for food.\"\n\n\n He turned back to the controls, flipped a switch, and the cutting of  the nose rocket dropped the ship in an angling glide toward the clouds  a few miles below. Gravity was full strength now, and although not as  great as Earth's, was still strong enough to bring a sense of giddiness  to the men.\n\n\n \"Here we go!\" Splinter said tonelessly.\n\n\n The great cottony batts of roiling clouds rushed up to meet the ship,  bringing the first sense of violent movement in more than a week of  flying. There was something awesome and breath-taking in the speed with  which the ship dropped toward the planet.\n\n\n Tendrils of vapor touched the ports, were whipped aside, then were  replaced by heavier fingers of cloud. Kerry Blane pressed a firing  stud, and nose rockets thrummed in a rising crescendo as the free fall  of the cruiser was checked. Heat rose in the cabin from the friction of  the outer air, then dissipated, as the force-screen voltometer leaped  higher.\n\n\n Then, as though it had never been, the sun disappeared, and there was  only a gray blankness pressing about the ship. Gone was all sense of  movement, and the ship seemed to hover in a gray nothingness.\n\n\n Kerry Blane crouched over the control panel, his hands moving deftly,  his eyes flicking from one instrument to another. Tiny lines of  concentration etched themselves about his mouth, and perspiration  beaded his forehead. He rode that cruiser through the miles of clouds  through sheer instinctive ability, seeming to fly it as though he were  an integral part of the ship.\n\n\n Splinter Wood watched him with awe in his eyes, seeing for the first  time the incredible instinct that had made Kerry Blane the idol of a  billion people. He relaxed visibly, all instinctive fear allayed by the  brilliant competence of his companion.\n\n\n Seconds flowed into moments, and the moments merged into one another,  and still the clouds pressed with a visible strength against the  ports. The rockets drummed steadily, holding the ship aloft, dropping  it slowly toward the planet below. Then the clouds thinned, and,  incredibly, were permeated with a dim and glowing light. A second  later, and the clouds were gone, and a thousand feet below tumbled and  tossed in a majestic display of ruthless strength an ocean that seemed  to be composed of liquid fluorescence.\n\n\n Kerry Blane heard Splinter's instant sigh of unbelief.\n\n\n \"Good Lord!\" Splinter said, \"What\u2014\"\n\n\n His voice stilled, and he was silent, his eyes drinking in the weird  incredible scene below. The ocean was a shifting, white-capped wash of silvery light that  gleamed with a bright phosphorescence of a hundred, intermingled,  kaleidoscopic colors. And the unreal, unearthly light continued  unbroken everywhere, reflected from the low-hanging clouds, reaching  to the far horizon, bathing every detail of the planet in a brilliance  more bright than moonlight.\n\n\n Splinter turned a wondering face. \"But the official reports say that  there is no light on Venus,\" he exclaimed. \"That was one of the reasons  given when exploration was forbidden!\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane nodded. \"That was merely a pretext to keep foolhardy  spacemen from losing their lives on the planet. In reality, the  ocean is alive with an incredibly tiny marine worm that glows  phosphorescently. The light generated from those billions of worms is  reflected back from the clouds, makes Venus eternally lighted.\"\n\n\n He turned the ship to the North, relaxed a bit on the air bunk. He  felt tired and worn, his body aching from the space bends of a few  hours before.\n\n\n \"Take over,\" he said wearily. \"Take the ship North, and watch for any  island.\"\n\n\n Splinter nodded, rested his long hands on the controls. The space  cruiser lifted a bit in a sudden spurt of speed, and the rocket-sound  was a solid thrum of unleashed power.\n\n\n Kerry Blane lit a cigarette, leaned toward a vision port. He felt again  that thrill he had experienced when he had first flashed his single-man  cruiser through the clouds years before. Then the breath caught in his  throat, and he tapped his companion's arm.\n\n\n \"Take a look!\" he called excitedly.\n\n\n They fought in the ocean below, fought in a never-ending splashing of  what seemed to be liquid fire. It was like watching a tri-dim screen of  a news event, except for the utter lack of sound.\n\n\n One was scaly, while the other was skinned, and both were fully three  hundred feet long. Great scimitars of teeth flashed in the light, and  blood gouted and stained the water crimson whenever a slashing blow was  struck. They threshed in a mad paroxysm of rage, whirling and spinning  in the phosphorescent water like beings from a nightmare, exploding  out of their element time and again, only to fall back in a gargantuan  spray of fluorescence.\n\n\n And then the scaly monster flashed in a half-turn, drove forward with  jaws agape, wrenched and ripped at the smooth black throat of the other  creature. The second creature rippled and undulated in agony, whipping  the ocean to foam, then went limp. The victorious monster circled the  body of its dead foe, then, majestically, plunged from sight into the  ocean's depths. An instant later, the water frothed, as hundreds of  lesser marine monsters attacked and fed on the floating corpse.\n\n\n \"Brrrr!\" Splinter shivered in sudden horror.\n\n\n Kerry Blane chuckled dryly. \"Feel like going for a swim?\" he asked  conversationally.\n\n\n Splinter shook his head, watched the scene disappear from view to the  rear of the line of flight, then sank back onto his bunk.\n\n\n \"Not me!\" he said deprecatingly.\n\n\n Kerry Blane chuckled again, swung the cruiser toward the tiny smudge of  black on the horizon. Glowing water flashed beneath the ship, seeming  to smooth into a gleaming mirror shot with dancing colors. There was no  sign of life anywhere.\n\n\n Thirty minutes later, Kerry Blane circled the island that floated  free in the phosphorescent ocean. His keen eyes searched the tangled  luxuriant growth of the jungle below, searching for some indication  that the protoplasmic monster he seeked was there.\n\n\n \"I don't see anything suspicious,\" Splinter contributed.\n\n\n \"There's nothing special to see,\" Kerry Blane said shortly. \"As I  understand it, anyway, this chunk of animated appetite hangs around an  island shaped like a turtle. However, our orders are to investigate  every island, just in case there might be more than one of the  monsters.\"\n\n\n Splinter buckled on his dis-gun, excitement flaring in his eyes.\n\n\n \"Let's do a little exploring?\" he said eagerly.\n\n\n Kerry Blane shook his head, swung the cruiser north again.\n\n\n \"Plenty of time for that later,\" he said mildly. \"We'll find this  turtle-island, make a landing, and take a look around. Later, if we're  lucky enough to blow our objective to Kingdom Come, we'll do a little  exploring of the other islands.\"\n\n\n \"Hell!\" Splinter scowled in mock disgust. \"An old woman like you should  be taking in knitting for a living!\"\n\n\n \"Orders are orders!\" Kerry Blane shrugged. He swung the cruiser in a wide arc to the north, trebling the flying  speed within minutes, handling the controls with a familiar dexterity.  He said nothing, searched the gleaming ocean for the smudge of  blackness that would denote another island. His gaze flicked amusedly,  now and then, to the lanky Splinter who scowled moodily and toyed with  the dis-gun in his long hands.\n\n\n \"Cheer up, lad,\" Kerry Blane said finally. \"I think you'll find plenty  to occupy your time shortly.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe?\" Splinter said gloomily.\n\n\n He idly swallowed another vitamin capsule, grinned, when he saw Kerry  Blane's automatic grimace of distaste. Then he yawned hugely, twisted  into a comfortable position, dozed sleepily.\n\n\n Kerry Blane rode the controls for the next three hours, searching the  limitless ocean for the few specks of islands that followed the slow  currents of the water planet. Always, there was the same misty light  surrounding the ship, never dimming, giving a sense of unreality to the  scene below. Nowhere was there the slightest sign of life until, in the  fourth hour of flight, a tiny dot of blackness came slowly over the  horizon's water line.\n\n\n Kerry Blane spun the ship in a tight circle, sent it flashing to the  west. His keen eyes lighted, when he finally made out the turtle-like  outline of the island, and he whistled softly, off-key, as he nudged  the snoring Splinter.\n\n\n \"This is it, Sleeping Beauty,\" he called. \"Snap out of it!\"\n\n\n \"Huh? Whuzzat?\" Splinter grunted, rolled to his elbow.\n\n\n \"Here's the island.\"\n\n\n \"Oh!\" Splinter swung his feet from the bunk, peered from the vision  port, sleepiness instantly erased from his face.\n\n\n \"Hot damn!\" he chortled. \"Now we'll see a little action!\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane grinned, tried to conceal the excitement he felt. He shook  his head, his fingers flickering over the control studs.\n\n\n \"Don't get your hopes too high, lad,\" he counseled. \"With those super  Zelta guns, it won't take ten minutes to wipe out that monster.\"\n\n\n Splinter rubbed his hands together, sighed like a boy seeing his first  circus. \"Listen, for ten minutes of that, I'd ride this chunk of metal  for a year!\"\n\n\n \"Could be!\" Kerry Blane agreed.\n\n\n He peered through the port, seeking any spot clear enough for a landing  field. Except for a strip of open beach, the island was a solid mass of  heavy fern-like growth.\n\n\n \"Belt yourself,\" Kerry Blane warned. \"If that beach isn't solid, I'll  have to lift the ship in a hell of a hurry.\"\n\n\n \"Right!\" Splinter's fingers were all thumbs in his excitement.\n\n\n Kerry Blane set the controls for a shallow glide, his fingers moving  like a concert pianist's. The cruiser yawed slightly, settled slowly  in a flat shallow glide.\n\n\n \"We're going in,\" Kerry Blane said quietly.\n\n\n He closed a knife switch, seeing too late the vitamin capsule that was  lodged in the slot. There was the sharp splutter of a short-circuit,  and a thin tendril of smoke drifted upward.\n\n\n \"Damn!\" Kerry Blane swore briefly.\n\n\n There was an instant, terrific explosion of the stern jets, and the  cruiser hurtled toward the beach like a gravity-crazed comet.\n\n\n Kerry Blane said absolutely nothing, his breath driven from him by the  suck of inertia. His hands darted for the controls, seeking to balance  the forces that threw the ship about like a toy. He cut all rockets  with a smashing swoop of his hand, tried to fire the bow rockets. But  the short had ruined the entire control system.\n\n\n For one interminable second, he saw the uncanny uprush of the island  below. He flicked his gaze about, saw the instant terror that wiped  all other expression from his young companion's face. Then the cruiser  plowed into the silvery sand.\n\n\n Belts parted like rotten string; they were thrown forward with crushing  force against the control panel. They groped feebly for support, their  bodies twisting involuntarily, as the ship cartwheeled a dozen times in  a few seconds. Almost instantly, consciousness was battered from them.\n\n\n With one final, grinding bounce, the cruiser rolled to its side,  twisted over and over for a hundred yards, then came to a metal-ripping  stop against a moss-grown boulder at the water's edge. III\n\n\n Kerry Blane choked, tried to turn his head from the water that trickled  into his face. He opened his eyes, stared blankly, uncomprehendingly  into the bloody features of the man bending over him.\n\n\n \"What happened?\" he gasped.\n\n\n Splinter Wood laughed, almost hysterically, mopped at his forehead with  a wet handkerchief.\n\n\n \"I thought you were dead!\" he said simply.\n\n\n Kerry Blane moved his arm experimentally, felt broken bones grate in  an exquisite wave of pain. He fought back the nausea, gazed about the  cabin, realized the ship lay on its side.\n\n\n \"Maybe I am,\" he said ruefully. \"No man could live through that crash.\"\n\n\n Splinter moved away, sat down tiredly on the edge of a bunk. He shook  his head dazedly, inspected the long cut on his leg.\n\n\n \"We seem to have done it,\" he said dully.\n\n\n Kerry Blane nodded, clambered to his feet, favoring his broken arm.  He leaned over the control panel, inspecting the dials with a worried  gaze. Slowly, his eyes lightened, and his voice was almost cheerful as  he swung about.\n\n\n \"Everything is more or less okay,\" he said. \"The board will have to  be rewired, but nothing else seems to be damaged so that repairs are  needed.\"\n\n\n Splinter looked up from his task of bandaging his leg. \"What caused  the crash?\" he asked. \"One minute, everything was all right; the next,  Blooey!\"\n\n\n Anger suddenly mottled Kerry Blane's face; he swore monotonously and  bitterly for a moment.\n\n\n \"Those gol-damned pills you been taking caused the crash!\" he roared.  \"One of them broke and shorted out the control board.\" He scowled at  the incredulous Splinter. \"By the three tails of a Martian sand-pup, I  ought to cram the rest of them down your throat, boxes and all!\"\n\n\n Splinter flushed, seemed to be fumbling for words. After a bit, Kerry  Blane grinned.\n\n\n \"Forget it, lad,\" he said more kindly, \"those things happen. Now, if  you'll bind a splint about my arm, we'll see what we can do about  righting the ship.\"\n\n\n Splinter nodded, opened the medical locker, worked with tape and  splints for minutes. Great beads of perspiration stood out in high  relief on Kerry Blane's forehead, but he made no sound. At last,  Splinter finished, tucked the supplies away.\n\n\n \"Now what?\" he asked subduedly.\n\n\n \"Let's take a look outside, maybe set up the Zelta guns. Can't tell but  what that protoplasmic nightmare might take a notion to pay us a visit  in the near future!\"\n\n\n \"Right!\" Splinter unscrewed the port cogs, swung the portal back.\n\n\n He swung lithely from the portal, reached down a hand to help the  older man. After much puffing and grunting, Kerry Blane managed to  clamber through the port. They stood for a moment in silent wonder,  staring at the long lazy rollers of milky fluorescence that rolled  endlessly toward the beach, then turned to gaze at the great fern-like  trees that towered two hundred feet into the air.\n\n\n \"How big do you feel now?\" Kerry Blane asked quietly.\n\n\n Splinter Wood was silent, awed by the beauty and the tremendous size of  the growths on the water world.\n\n\n Kerry Blane walked the length of the cruiser, examining the slight  damage done by the crash, evaluating the situation with a practiced  gaze. He nodded slowly, retraced his steps, and stood looking at the  furrow plowed in the sand.\n\n\n \"Won't be any trouble at all to lift the ship,\" he called. \"After  rewiring the board, we'll turn the ship with an underjet, swing it  about, and head her toward the sea.\"\n\n\n Splinter nodded, dropped into the open port. A moment later, he flipped  a rope ladder outside, where it dangled to the ground, then climbed out  himself, carrying the two Zelta guns.\n\n\n \"We'd better test these,\" he said. \"We don't want any slip-ups when we  do go into action.\"\n\n\n He climbed down the ladder, laid the guns aside, then reached up a  hand to aid Kerry Blane's descent. Kerry Blane came down slowly and  awkwardly, jumped the last few feet. He felt surprisingly light and  strong in the lesser gravity.\n\n\n He stood, leaning against the ship, watching as Splinter picked up  the first gun and leveled it at a gigantic tree. Splinter sighted  carefully, winked at the older man, then pressed the firing stud.\n\n\n Nothing happened; there was no hissing crackle of released energy.\n\n\n Kerry Blane strode forward, puzzlement on his lined face, his hand  out-stretched toward the defective weapon. Splinter gaped at the gun in  his hands, held it out wordlessly.\n\n\n \"The crash must have broken something,\" Kerry Blane said slowly.\n\n\n Splinter shook his head. \"There's only one moving part,\" he said, \"and  that's the force gate on the firing stud.\"\n\n\n \"Try the other,\" Kerry Blane said slowly.\n\n\n \"Okay!\"\n\n\n Splinter lifted the second gun, pressed the stud, gazed white-faced at  his companion.\n\n\n \"It won't work, either,\" he said stupidly. \"I don't get it? The source  of power is limitless. Solar rays never\u2014\"\n\n\n Old Kerry Blane dropped the first gun to his side, swore harshly.\n\n\n \"Damn it,\" he said. \"They didn't think of it; you didn't think of it;  and I most certainly forgot! Solar rays can't penetrate the miles of  clouds on Venus. Those guns are utterly useless as weapons!\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow did Splinter feel about being with Kerry on the turtle-shaped island?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Pitiful that he had broken his arm\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Relieved to have his experience at hand\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Relieved to have his experience at hand\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Relieved to have his experience at hand\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

      "content": "1. Restatement of Position  \n   I maintain that, on the turtle-shaped island, Splinter Wood\u2019s predominant emotion is pity and protective concern for Kerry Blane\u2019s broken arm, not mere relief at his survival or desire for action.  \n\n2. Evidence of Pity and Protective Concern  \n   a. Immediate Priority on Medical Care  \n     \u2022 \u201cWe seem to have done it.\u201d (III) Splinter\u2019s first words after regaining consciousness are relief that the crash didn\u2019t kill Kerry\u2014but he immediately \u201cbound a splint about my arm \u2026 worked with tape and splints for minutes,\u201d placing Kerry\u2019s injury above all other tasks. (III)  \n     \u2022 Only after securing Kerry does Splinter attend to his own cut (\u201cthe long cut on his leg\u201d), showing Splinter defers his own welfare until Kerry is stabilized. (III)  \n\n   b. Deference and Dependence on Injured Kerry  \n     \u2022 Splinter, despite earlier eagerness (\u201cHot damn! Now we\u2019ll see a little action!\u201d II), declines independent exploration on the island and insists on following Kerry\u2019s lead: \u201cLet\u2019s take a look outside, maybe set up the Zelta guns,\u201d implicitly asking Kerry to participate despite his injury. (III)  \n     \u2022 Splinter trusts and waits for Kerry to repair the ship (\u201cAfter rewiring the board \u2026 head her toward the sea\u201d), showing emotional reliance on Kerry\u2019s physical capability as soon as he is able. (III)  \n\n   c. Behavioral Contrast before and after Crash  \n     \u2022 Prior eagerness for action is replaced by \u201ctiredly\u201d working to right the ship and test weapons under Kerry\u2019s supervision. Splinter\u2019s amazement at the guns\u2019 failure (\u201cheld it out wordlessly,\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t get it\u201d) underscores that he feels lost without Kerry\u2019s leadership and laments their mutual helplessness. (III)  \n\n3. Logical Reasoning  \n   a. Pity explains Splinter\u2019s selfless risk-taking in low gravity and dangerous environment to aid Kerry\u2019s mobility (rope ladder, guiding Kerry through portal). Relief-at-skill would more likely cause Splinter to conserve strength until Kerry was fully functional.  \n   b. Splinter\u2019s insistence on involving Kerry in danger despite his broken arm signals pity-driven loyalty, not cold opportunism; pity seeks to restore Kerry to duty, not abandon him to \u201crelief\u201d that someone else might take over.  \n   c. Emotional nuance: pity combines relief at survival with sorrow for injury. The question asks \u201cHow did Splinter feel about being with Kerry on the island?\u201d His behavior manifests empathetic pity more strongly than tactical relief.  \n\n4. Rebuttal of Debater_B\u2019s Relief Thesis  \n   Objection 1: Lack of Active Solo Exploration  \n     \u2022 Debater_B\u2019s notion of relief would predict Splinter exploring alone or pressing forward. Instead, Splinter never leaves Kerry\u2019s side or attempts independent reconnaissance, even though the ocean worms and Zelta guns emphasize isolation. This dependency is inconsistent with mere relief.  \n\n   Objection 2: No Celebration of Kerry\u2019s Skill  \n     \u2022 Splinter never exclaims admiration or volunteers to hand over controls solo. His earlier admiration (\u201cSeventy-eight new words \u2026 some day you can teach them to me\u201d I) is absent on the island, replaced by subdued, \u201ctired\u201d efforts to repair and protect. Relief-based confidence would be bolstered by Kerry\u2019s presence, yet Splinter shows exhaustion and trepidation.  \n\n   Objection 3: Deferred Mission Objectives  \n     \u2022 Splinter repeatedly delays mission (\u201cmaybe later,\u201d \u201cafter rewiring\u201d) until Kerry recovers. If relief at having Kerry\u2019s skill were primary, Splinter would urge immediate departure to destroy the protoplasm, fulfilling orders. Instead, pity forces a postponement until Kerry is physically capable.  \n\n5. Conclusion  \n   All available actions\u2014immediate medical aid, deference to Kerry despite personal risk, suspension of exploration, and emotional subordination\u2014demonstrate that Splinter\u2019s chief feeling on the turtle-shaped island is pity and concern for Kerry\u2019s broken arm. Only by restoring Kerry can Splinter resume the mission, but his willingness to wait and care illustrates genuine pity, not mere relief at Kerry\u2019s mere presence or readiness for action.",

Restatement of Position  \n   I maintain that, on the turtle-shaped island, Splinter Wood\u2019s predominant emotion is pity and protective concern for Kerry Blane\u2019s broken arm, not mere relief at his survival or desire for action.  \n\n2. Evidence of Pity and Protective Concern  \n   a. Immediate Priority on Medical Care  \n     \u2022 \u201cWe seem to have done it.\u201d (III) Splinter\u2019s first words after regaining consciousness are relief that the crash didn\u2019t kill Kerry\u2014but he immediately \u201cbound a splint about my arm \u2026 worked with tape and splints for minutes,\u201d placing Kerry\u2019s injury above all other tasks. (III)  \n     \u2022 Only after securing Kerry does Splinter attend to his own cut (\u201cthe long cut on his leg\u201d), showing Splinter defers his own welfare until Kerry is stabilized. (III)  \n\n   b. Deference and Dependence on Injured Kerry  \n     \u2022 Splinter, despite earlier eagerness (\u201cHot damn! Now we\u2019ll see a little action!\u201d II), declines independent exploration on the island and insists on following Kerry\u2019s lead: \u201cLet\u2019s take a look outside, maybe set up the Zelta guns,\u201d implicitly asking Kerry to participate despite his injury. (III)  \n     \u2022 Splinter trusts and waits for Kerry to repair the ship (\u201cAfter rewiring the board \u2026 head her toward the sea\u201d), showing emotional reliance on Kerry\u2019s physical capability as soon as he is able. (III)  \n\n   c. Behavioral Contrast before and after Crash  \n     \u2022 Prior eagerness for action is replaced by \u201ctiredly\u201d working to right the ship and test weapons under Kerry\u2019s supervision. Splinter\u2019s amazement at the guns\u2019 failure (\u201cheld it out wordlessly,\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t get it\u201d) underscores that he feels lost without Kerry\u2019s leadership and laments their mutual helplessness. (III)  \n\n3. Logical Reasoning  \n   a. Pity explains Splinter\u2019s selfless risk-taking in low gravity and dangerous environment to aid Kerry\u2019s mobility (rope ladder, guiding Kerry through portal). Relief-at-skill would more likely cause Splinter to conserve strength until Kerry was fully functional.  \n   b. Splinter\u2019s insistence on involving Kerry in danger despite his broken arm signals pity-driven loyalty, not cold opportunism; pity seeks to restore Kerry to duty, not abandon him to \u201crelief\u201d that someone else might take over.  \n   c. Emotional nuance: pity combines relief at survival with sorrow for injury. The question asks \u201cHow did Splinter feel about being with Kerry on the island?\u201d His behavior manifests empathetic pity more strongly than tactical relief.  \n\n4. Rebuttal of Debater_B\u2019s Relief Thesis  \n   Objection 1: Lack of Active Solo Exploration  \n     \u2022 Debater_B\u2019s notion of relief would predict Splinter exploring alone or pressing forward. Instead, Splinter never leaves Kerry\u2019s side or attempts independent reconnaissance, even though the ocean worms and Zelta guns emphasize isolation. This dependency is inconsistent with mere relief.  \n\n   Objection 2: No Celebration of Kerry\u2019s Skill  \n     \u2022 Splinter never exclaims admiration or volunteers to hand over controls solo. His earlier admiration (\u201cSeventy-eight new words \u2026 some day you can teach them to me\u201d I) is absent on the island, replaced by subdued, \u201ctired\u201d efforts to repair and protect. Relief-based confidence would be bolstered by Kerry\u2019s presence, yet Splinter shows exhaustion and trepidation.  \n\n   Objection 3: Deferred Mission Objectives  \n     \u2022 Splinter repeatedly delays mission (\u201cmaybe later,\u201d \u201cafter rewiring\u201d) until Kerry recovers. If relief at having Kerry\u2019s skill were primary, Splinter would urge immediate departure to destroy the protoplasm, fulfilling orders. Instead, pity forces a postponement until Kerry is physically capable.  \n\n5. Conclusion  \n   All available actions\u2014immediate medical aid, deference to Kerry despite personal risk, suspension of exploration, and emotional subordination\u2014demonstrate that Splinter\u2019s chief feeling on the turtle-shaped island is pity and concern for Kerry\u2019s broken arm. Only by restoring Kerry can Splinter resume the mission, but his willingness to wait and care illustrates genuine pity, not mere relief at Kerry\u2019s mere presence or readiness for action.",

PEACOCK The orders were explicit: \"Destroy the\n\n 'THING' of Venus.\" But Patrolmen Kerry\n\n Blane and Splinter Wood, their space-ship\n\n wrecked, could not follow orders\u2014their\n\n weapons were useless on the Water-world.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Winter 1942.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Old Kerry Blane exploded.\n\n\n \"Damn it!\" he roared. \"I don't like you; and I don't like this ship;  and I don't like the assignment; and I don't like those infernal pills  you keep eating; and I\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Splinter\" Wood grinned.\n\n\n \"Seems to me, Kerry,\" he remarked humorously, \"that you don't like much  of anything!\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane growled unintelligibly, batted the injector lever with a  calloused hand. His grizzled hair was a stiff wiry mop on his small  head, and his oversize jaw was thrust belligerently forward. But deep  within his eyes, where he hoped it was hidden, was a friendly twinkle  that gave the lie to his speech.\n\n\n \"You're a squirt!\" he snapped disagreeably. \"You're not dry behind  the ears, yet. You're like the rest of these kids who call themselves  pilots\u2014only more so! And why the hell the chief had to sic you on me,  on an exploration trip this important\u2014well, I'll never understand.\"\n\n\n Splinter rolled his six foot three of lanky body into a more  comfortable position on the air-bunk. He yawned tremendously, fumbled a  small box from his shirt pocket, and removed a marble-like capsule.\n\n\n \"Better take one of these,\" he warned. \"You're liable to get the space  bends at any moment.\"\n\n\n Old Kerry Blane snorted, batted the box aside impatiently, scowled  moodily at the capsules that bounced for a moment against the pilot  room's walls before hanging motionless in the air.\n\n\n \"Mister Wood,\" he said icily, \"I was flying a space ship while they  were changing your pants twenty times a day. When I want advice on how  to fly a ship, how to cure space bends, how to handle a Zelta ray, or  how to spit\u2014I'll ask you! Until then, you and your bloody marbles can  go plumb straight to the devil!\"\n\n\n \"Tsk! Tsk! Tsk!\" Splinter reached out lazily, plucked the capsules from  the air, one by one.\n\n\n Kerry Blane lit one of the five allotted cigarettes of the day.\n\n\n \"Don't 'tsk' me, you young squirt,\" he grunted around a mouthful of  fragrant smoke. \"I know all the arguments you can put up; ain't that  all I been hearing for a week? You take your vitamins A, B, C, D, all  you want, but you leave me alone\u2014or I'll stuff your head down your  throat, P.D.Q.!\"\n\n\n \"All right, all right!\" Splinter tucked the capsule box back into his  pocket, grinned mockingly. \"But don't say I didn't warn you. With this  shielded ship, and with no sunlight reaching Venus' surface, you're  gonna be begging for some of my vitamin, super-concentrated pills  before we get back to Earth.\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane made a rich, ripe noise with his mouth.\n\n\n \"Pfuii!\" he said very distinctly.\n\n\n \"Gracious!\" Splinter said in mock horror. They made a strange contrast as they lay in their air bunks. Splinter  was fully a head taller than the dour Irishman, and his lanky build  gave a false impression of awkwardness. While the vitriolic Kerry Blane  was short and compact, strength and quickness evident in every movement.\n\n\n Kerry Blane had flown every type of ship that rode in space. In the  passing years, he had flight-tested almost every new experimental ship,  had flown them with increasing skill, had earned a reputation as a  trouble shooter on any kind of craft.\n\n\n But even Kerry Blane had to retire eventually.\n\n\n A great retirement banquet had been given in his honor by the  Interplanetary Squadron. There had been the usual speeches and  presentations; and Kerry Blane had heard them all, had thanked the  donors of the gifts. But it was not until the next morning, when he was  dressed in civilian clothes for the first time in forty years, that he  realized the enormity of the thing that had happened to his life.\n\n\n Something died within Kerry Blane's heart that morning, shriveled and  passed away, leaving him suddenly shrunken and old. He had become like  a rusty old freighter couched between the gleaming bodies of great  space warriors.\n\n\n Finally, as a last resort so that he would not be thrown entirely  aside, he had taken a desk job in the squadron offices. For six years  he had dry-rotted there, waiting hopefully for the moment when his  active services would be needed again.\n\n\n It was there that he had met and liked the ungainly Splinter Wood.  There was something in the boy that had found a kindred spirit in Kerry  Blane's heart, and he had taken the youngster in hand to give him the  benefits of experience that had become legendary.\n\n\n Splinter Wood was a probationary pilot, had been admitted to the  Interplanetary Squadron because of his inherent skill, even though his  formal education had been fairly well neglected. Now, the two of them rode the pounding jets of a DX cruiser, bound  for Venus to make a personal survey of its floating islands for the  Interplanetary Squadron's Medical Division.\n\n\n \"Ten to one we don't get back!\" Splinter said pessimistically.\n\n\n Kerry Blane scrubbed out his cigarette, scowled bleakly at the  instrument panel. He sensed the faint thread of fear in the youngster's  tone, and a nostalgic twinge touched his heart, for he was remembering  the days of his youth when he had a full life to look forward to.\n\n\n \"If you're afraid, you can get out and walk back,\" he snapped  disagreeably.\n\n\n A grin lifted the corners of Splinter's long mouth, spread into his  eyes. His hand unconsciously came up, touched the tiny squadron pin on  his lapel.\n\n\n \"Sorry to disappoint you, glory grabber,\" he said mockingly, \"but I've  got definite orders to take care of you.\"\n\n\n \" Me! You've got orders to take care of me ?\" Kerry Blane choked  incoherently for a moment, red tiding cholerically upward from his  loosened collar.\n\n\n \"Of course!\" Splinter grinned.\n\n\n Kerry Blane exploded, words spewing volcanically forth. Splinter  relaxed, his booted foot beating out a dull rhythm to the colorful  language learned through almost fifty years of spacing. And at last,  when Kerry Blane had quieted until he but smoldered, he leaned over and  touched the old spacer on the sleeve.\n\n\n \"Seventy-eight!\" he remarked pleasantly.\n\n\n \"Seventy-eight what?\" Kerry Blane asked sullenly, the old twinkle  beginning to light again deep in his eyes.\n\n\n \"Seventy-eight new words\u2014and you swore them beautifully!\" Splinter  beamed. \"Some day you can teach them to me.\"\n\n\n They laughed then, Old Kerry Blane and young Splinter Wood, and  the warmth of their friendship was a tangible thing in the small  control-room of the cruiser.\n\n\n And in the midst of their laughter, Old Kerry Blane choked in agony,  surged desperately against his bunk straps.\n\n\n He screamed unknowingly, feeling only the horrible excruciating agony  of his body, tasting the blood that gushed from his mouth and nostrils.  His muscles were knotted cords that he could not loosen, and his blood  was a surging stream that pounded at his throbbing temples. The air he  breathed seemed to be molten flame.\n\n\n His body arced again and again against the restraining straps, and his  mouth was open in a soundless scream. He sensed dimly that his partner  had wrenched open a wall door, removed metal medicine kits, and was  fumbling through their contents. He felt the bite of the hypodermic,  felt a deadly numbness replace the raging torment that had been his  for seconds. He swallowed three capsules automatically, passed into a  coma-like sleep, woke hours later to stare clear-eyed into Splinter's  concerned face.\n\n\n \"Close, wasn't it?\" he said weakly, conversationally.\n\n\n \"Close enough!\" Splinter agreed relievedly. \"If you had followed my  advice and taken those vitamin capsules, you'd never have had the  bends.\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane grinned, winced when he felt the dull ache in his body.\n\n\n \"I've had the bends before, and lived through them!\" he said, still  weakly defiant.\n\n\n \"That's the past,\" Splinter said quietly. \"This is the present, and you  take your pills every day, just as I do\u2014from now on.\"\n\n\n \"All right\u2014and thanks!\"\n\n\n \"Forget it!\" Splinter flushed in quick embarrassment.\n\n\n A buzzer sounded from the instrument panel, and a tiny light glowed  redly.\n\n\n \"Six hours more,\" Splinter said, turned to the instrument panel.\n\n\n His long hands played over the instrument panel, checking, controlling  the rocket fire, adjusting delicate instruments to hairline marks.  Kerry Blane nodded in silent approval.\n\n\n They could feel the first tug of gravity on their bodies, and through  the vision port could see the greenish ball that was cloud-covered  Venus. Excitement lifted their spirits, brought light to their eyes as  they peered eagerly ahead.\n\n\n \"What's it really like?\" Splinter asked impatiently.\n\n\n Kerry Blane yawned, settled back luxuriously. \"I'll tell you later,\" he  said, \"I'm going to take a nap and try to ease this bellyache of mine.  Wake me up so that I can take over, when we land; Venus is a tricky  place to set a ship on.\"\n\n\n He yawned again, drifted instantly into sleep, relaxing with the  ability of a spaceman who sleeps when and if he can. Splinter smiled  down at his sleeping partner, then turned back to the quartzite port.  He shook his head a bit, remembering the stories he had heard about the  water planet, wondering\u2014wondering\u2014 II\n\n\n Venus was a fluffy cotton ball hanging motionless in bottomless  space. Far to the left, Mercury gleamed like a polished diamond in  the sunlight. Kerry Blane cut the driving rockets, let the cruiser  sink into a fast gravity-dive, guiding it only now and then by a brief  flicker of a side jet.\n\n\n Splinter Wood watched breathlessly from the vision port, his long face  eager and reckless, his eyes seeking to pierce the clouds that roiled  and twisted uneasily over the surface of the planet.\n\n\n Kerry Blane glanced tolerantly at his young companion, felt a nostalgic  tug at his heart when he remembered the first time he had approached  the water-planet years before. Then, he had been a young and reckless  firebrand, his fame already spreading, an unquenchable fire of  adventure flaming in his heart.\n\n\n Now, his aged but steady fingers rested lightly on the controls,  brought the patrol cruiser closer to the cloud-banks on the line of  demarcation between the sunward and sunless sides of the planet. He  hummed tunelessly, strangely happy, as he peered ahead.\n\n\n \"Val Kenton died there,\" Splinter whispered softly, \"Died to save the  lives of three other people!\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane nodded. \"Yes,\" he agreed, and his voice changed subtly.  \"Val was a blackguard, a criminal; but he died in the best traditions  of the service.\" He sighed. \"He never had a chance.\"\n\n\n \"Murdered!\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane smiled grimly. \"I guess I used too broad an interpretation  of the word,\" he said gently. \"Anyway, one of our main tasks is to  destroy the thing that killed him.\"\n\n\n His lean fingers tightened unconsciously.\n\n\n \"I'd like nothing better than to turn a Zelta-blaster on that chunk of  living protoplasm and cremate it.\"\n\n\n Splinters shivered slightly. \"Do you think we'll find it?\" he asked.\n\n\n Kerry Blane nodded. \"I think it will find us; after all, it's just an  animated appetite looking for food.\"\n\n\n He turned back to the controls, flipped a switch, and the cutting of  the nose rocket dropped the ship in an angling glide toward the clouds  a few miles below. Gravity was full strength now, and although not as  great as Earth's, was still strong enough to bring a sense of giddiness  to the men.\n\n\n \"Here we go!\" Splinter said tonelessly.\n\n\n The great cottony batts of roiling clouds rushed up to meet the ship,  bringing the first sense of violent movement in more than a week of  flying. There was something awesome and breath-taking in the speed with  which the ship dropped toward the planet.\n\n\n Tendrils of vapor touched the ports, were whipped aside, then were  replaced by heavier fingers of cloud. Kerry Blane pressed a firing  stud, and nose rockets thrummed in a rising crescendo as the free fall  of the cruiser was checked. Heat rose in the cabin from the friction of  the outer air, then dissipated, as the force-screen voltometer leaped  higher.\n\n\n Then, as though it had never been, the sun disappeared, and there was  only a gray blankness pressing about the ship. Gone was all sense of  movement, and the ship seemed to hover in a gray nothingness.\n\n\n Kerry Blane crouched over the control panel, his hands moving deftly,  his eyes flicking from one instrument to another. Tiny lines of  concentration etched themselves about his mouth, and perspiration  beaded his forehead. He rode that cruiser through the miles of clouds  through sheer instinctive ability, seeming to fly it as though he were  an integral part of the ship.\n\n\n Splinter Wood watched him with awe in his eyes, seeing for the first  time the incredible instinct that had made Kerry Blane the idol of a  billion people. He relaxed visibly, all instinctive fear allayed by the  brilliant competence of his companion.\n\n\n Seconds flowed into moments, and the moments merged into one another,  and still the clouds pressed with a visible strength against the  ports. The rockets drummed steadily, holding the ship aloft, dropping  it slowly toward the planet below. Then the clouds thinned, and,  incredibly, were permeated with a dim and glowing light. A second  later, and the clouds were gone, and a thousand feet below tumbled and  tossed in a majestic display of ruthless strength an ocean that seemed  to be composed of liquid fluorescence.\n\n\n Kerry Blane heard Splinter's instant sigh of unbelief.\n\n\n \"Good Lord!\" Splinter said, \"What\u2014\"\n\n\n His voice stilled, and he was silent, his eyes drinking in the weird  incredible scene below. The ocean was a shifting, white-capped wash of silvery light that  gleamed with a bright phosphorescence of a hundred, intermingled,  kaleidoscopic colors. And the unreal, unearthly light continued  unbroken everywhere, reflected from the low-hanging clouds, reaching  to the far horizon, bathing every detail of the planet in a brilliance  more bright than moonlight.\n\n\n Splinter turned a wondering face. \"But the official reports say that  there is no light on Venus,\" he exclaimed. \"That was one of the reasons  given when exploration was forbidden!\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane nodded. \"That was merely a pretext to keep foolhardy  spacemen from losing their lives on the planet. In reality, the  ocean is alive with an incredibly tiny marine worm that glows  phosphorescently. The light generated from those billions of worms is  reflected back from the clouds, makes Venus eternally lighted.\"\n\n\n He turned the ship to the North, relaxed a bit on the air bunk. He  felt tired and worn, his body aching from the space bends of a few  hours before.\n\n\n \"Take over,\" he said wearily. \"Take the ship North, and watch for any  island.\"\n\n\n Splinter nodded, rested his long hands on the controls. The space  cruiser lifted a bit in a sudden spurt of speed, and the rocket-sound  was a solid thrum of unleashed power.\n\n\n Kerry Blane lit a cigarette, leaned toward a vision port. He felt again  that thrill he had experienced when he had first flashed his single-man  cruiser through the clouds years before. Then the breath caught in his  throat, and he tapped his companion's arm.\n\n\n \"Take a look!\" he called excitedly.\n\n\n They fought in the ocean below, fought in a never-ending splashing of  what seemed to be liquid fire. It was like watching a tri-dim screen of  a news event, except for the utter lack of sound.\n\n\n One was scaly, while the other was skinned, and both were fully three  hundred feet long. Great scimitars of teeth flashed in the light, and  blood gouted and stained the water crimson whenever a slashing blow was  struck. They threshed in a mad paroxysm of rage, whirling and spinning  in the phosphorescent water like beings from a nightmare, exploding  out of their element time and again, only to fall back in a gargantuan  spray of fluorescence.\n\n\n And then the scaly monster flashed in a half-turn, drove forward with  jaws agape, wrenched and ripped at the smooth black throat of the other  creature. The second creature rippled and undulated in agony, whipping  the ocean to foam, then went limp. The victorious monster circled the  body of its dead foe, then, majestically, plunged from sight into the  ocean's depths. An instant later, the water frothed, as hundreds of  lesser marine monsters attacked and fed on the floating corpse.\n\n\n \"Brrrr!\" Splinter shivered in sudden horror.\n\n\n Kerry Blane chuckled dryly. \"Feel like going for a swim?\" he asked  conversationally.\n\n\n Splinter shook his head, watched the scene disappear from view to the  rear of the line of flight, then sank back onto his bunk.\n\n\n \"Not me!\" he said deprecatingly.\n\n\n Kerry Blane chuckled again, swung the cruiser toward the tiny smudge of  black on the horizon. Glowing water flashed beneath the ship, seeming  to smooth into a gleaming mirror shot with dancing colors. There was no  sign of life anywhere.\n\n\n Thirty minutes later, Kerry Blane circled the island that floated  free in the phosphorescent ocean. His keen eyes searched the tangled  luxuriant growth of the jungle below, searching for some indication  that the protoplasmic monster he seeked was there.\n\n\n \"I don't see anything suspicious,\" Splinter contributed.\n\n\n \"There's nothing special to see,\" Kerry Blane said shortly. \"As I  understand it, anyway, this chunk of animated appetite hangs around an  island shaped like a turtle. However, our orders are to investigate  every island, just in case there might be more than one of the  monsters.\"\n\n\n Splinter buckled on his dis-gun, excitement flaring in his eyes.\n\n\n \"Let's do a little exploring?\" he said eagerly.\n\n\n Kerry Blane shook his head, swung the cruiser north again.\n\n\n \"Plenty of time for that later,\" he said mildly. \"We'll find this  turtle-island, make a landing, and take a look around. Later, if we're  lucky enough to blow our objective to Kingdom Come, we'll do a little  exploring of the other islands.\"\n\n\n \"Hell!\" Splinter scowled in mock disgust. \"An old woman like you should  be taking in knitting for a living!\"\n\n\n \"Orders are orders!\" Kerry Blane shrugged. He swung the cruiser in a wide arc to the north, trebling the flying  speed within minutes, handling the controls with a familiar dexterity.  He said nothing, searched the gleaming ocean for the smudge of  blackness that would denote another island. His gaze flicked amusedly,  now and then, to the lanky Splinter who scowled moodily and toyed with  the dis-gun in his long hands.\n\n\n \"Cheer up, lad,\" Kerry Blane said finally. \"I think you'll find plenty  to occupy your time shortly.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe?\" Splinter said gloomily.\n\n\n He idly swallowed another vitamin capsule, grinned, when he saw Kerry  Blane's automatic grimace of distaste. Then he yawned hugely, twisted  into a comfortable position, dozed sleepily.\n\n\n Kerry Blane rode the controls for the next three hours, searching the  limitless ocean for the few specks of islands that followed the slow  currents of the water planet. Always, there was the same misty light  surrounding the ship, never dimming, giving a sense of unreality to the  scene below. Nowhere was there the slightest sign of life until, in the  fourth hour of flight, a tiny dot of blackness came slowly over the  horizon's water line.\n\n\n Kerry Blane spun the ship in a tight circle, sent it flashing to the  west. His keen eyes lighted, when he finally made out the turtle-like  outline of the island, and he whistled softly, off-key, as he nudged  the snoring Splinter.\n\n\n \"This is it, Sleeping Beauty,\" he called. \"Snap out of it!\"\n\n\n \"Huh? Whuzzat?\" Splinter grunted, rolled to his elbow.\n\n\n \"Here's the island.\"\n\n\n \"Oh!\" Splinter swung his feet from the bunk, peered from the vision  port, sleepiness instantly erased from his face.\n\n\n \"Hot damn!\" he chortled. \"Now we'll see a little action!\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane grinned, tried to conceal the excitement he felt. He shook  his head, his fingers flickering over the control studs.\n\n\n \"Don't get your hopes too high, lad,\" he counseled. \"With those super  Zelta guns, it won't take ten minutes to wipe out that monster.\"\n\n\n Splinter rubbed his hands together, sighed like a boy seeing his first  circus. \"Listen, for ten minutes of that, I'd ride this chunk of metal  for a year!\"\n\n\n \"Could be!\" Kerry Blane agreed.\n\n\n He peered through the port, seeking any spot clear enough for a landing  field. Except for a strip of open beach, the island was a solid mass of  heavy fern-like growth.\n\n\n \"Belt yourself,\" Kerry Blane warned. \"If that beach isn't solid, I'll  have to lift the ship in a hell of a hurry.\"\n\n\n \"Right!\" Splinter's fingers were all thumbs in his excitement.\n\n\n Kerry Blane set the controls for a shallow glide, his fingers moving  like a concert pianist's. The cruiser yawed slightly, settled slowly  in a flat shallow glide.\n\n\n \"We're going in,\" Kerry Blane said quietly.\n\n\n He closed a knife switch, seeing too late the vitamin capsule that was  lodged in the slot. There was the sharp splutter of a short-circuit,  and a thin tendril of smoke drifted upward.\n\n\n \"Damn!\" Kerry Blane swore briefly.\n\n\n There was an instant, terrific explosion of the stern jets, and the  cruiser hurtled toward the beach like a gravity-crazed comet.\n\n\n Kerry Blane said absolutely nothing, his breath driven from him by the  suck of inertia. His hands darted for the controls, seeking to balance  the forces that threw the ship about like a toy. He cut all rockets  with a smashing swoop of his hand, tried to fire the bow rockets. But  the short had ruined the entire control system.\n\n\n For one interminable second, he saw the uncanny uprush of the island  below. He flicked his gaze about, saw the instant terror that wiped  all other expression from his young companion's face. Then the cruiser  plowed into the silvery sand.\n\n\n Belts parted like rotten string; they were thrown forward with crushing  force against the control panel. They groped feebly for support, their  bodies twisting involuntarily, as the ship cartwheeled a dozen times in  a few seconds. Almost instantly, consciousness was battered from them.\n\n\n With one final, grinding bounce, the cruiser rolled to its side,  twisted over and over for a hundred yards, then came to a metal-ripping  stop against a moss-grown boulder at the water's edge. III\n\n\n Kerry Blane choked, tried to turn his head from the water that trickled  into his face. He opened his eyes, stared blankly, uncomprehendingly  into the bloody features of the man bending over him.\n\n\n \"What happened?\" he gasped.\n\n\n Splinter Wood laughed, almost hysterically, mopped at his forehead with  a wet handkerchief.\n\n\n \"I thought you were dead!\" he said simply.\n\n\n Kerry Blane moved his arm experimentally, felt broken bones grate in  an exquisite wave of pain. He fought back the nausea, gazed about the  cabin, realized the ship lay on its side.\n\n\n \"Maybe I am,\" he said ruefully. \"No man could live through that crash.\"\n\n\n Splinter moved away, sat down tiredly on the edge of a bunk. He shook  his head dazedly, inspected the long cut on his leg.\n\n\n \"We seem to have done it,\" he said dully.\n\n\n Kerry Blane nodded, clambered to his feet, favoring his broken arm.  He leaned over the control panel, inspecting the dials with a worried  gaze. Slowly, his eyes lightened, and his voice was almost cheerful as  he swung about.\n\n\n \"Everything is more or less okay,\" he said. \"The board will have to  be rewired, but nothing else seems to be damaged so that repairs are  needed.\"\n\n\n Splinter looked up from his task of bandaging his leg. \"What caused  the crash?\" he asked. \"One minute, everything was all right; the next,  Blooey!\"\n\n\n Anger suddenly mottled Kerry Blane's face; he swore monotonously and  bitterly for a moment.\n\n\n \"Those gol-damned pills you been taking caused the crash!\" he roared.  \"One of them broke and shorted out the control board.\" He scowled at  the incredulous Splinter. \"By the three tails of a Martian sand-pup, I  ought to cram the rest of them down your throat, boxes and all!\"\n\n\n Splinter flushed, seemed to be fumbling for words. After a bit, Kerry  Blane grinned.\n\n\n \"Forget it, lad,\" he said more kindly, \"those things happen. Now, if  you'll bind a splint about my arm, we'll see what we can do about  righting the ship.\"\n\n\n Splinter nodded, opened the medical locker, worked with tape and  splints for minutes. Great beads of perspiration stood out in high  relief on Kerry Blane's forehead, but he made no sound. At last,  Splinter finished, tucked the supplies away.\n\n\n \"Now what?\" he asked subduedly.\n\n\n \"Let's take a look outside, maybe set up the Zelta guns. Can't tell but  what that protoplasmic nightmare might take a notion to pay us a visit  in the near future!\"\n\n\n \"Right!\" Splinter unscrewed the port cogs, swung the portal back.\n\n\n He swung lithely from the portal, reached down a hand to help the  older man. After much puffing and grunting, Kerry Blane managed to  clamber through the port. They stood for a moment in silent wonder,  staring at the long lazy rollers of milky fluorescence that rolled  endlessly toward the beach, then turned to gaze at the great fern-like  trees that towered two hundred feet into the air.\n\n\n \"How big do you feel now?\" Kerry Blane asked quietly.\n\n\n Splinter Wood was silent, awed by the beauty and the tremendous size of  the growths on the water world.\n\n\n Kerry Blane walked the length of the cruiser, examining the slight  damage done by the crash, evaluating the situation with a practiced  gaze. He nodded slowly, retraced his steps, and stood looking at the  furrow plowed in the sand.\n\n\n \"Won't be any trouble at all to lift the ship,\" he called. \"After  rewiring the board, we'll turn the ship with an underjet, swing it  about, and head her toward the sea.\"\n\n\n Splinter nodded, dropped into the open port. A moment later, he flipped  a rope ladder outside, where it dangled to the ground, then climbed out  himself, carrying the two Zelta guns.\n\n\n \"We'd better test these,\" he said. \"We don't want any slip-ups when we  do go into action.\"\n\n\n He climbed down the ladder, laid the guns aside, then reached up a  hand to aid Kerry Blane's descent. Kerry Blane came down slowly and  awkwardly, jumped the last few feet. He felt surprisingly light and  strong in the lesser gravity.\n\n\n He stood, leaning against the ship, watching as Splinter picked up  the first gun and leveled it at a gigantic tree. Splinter sighted  carefully, winked at the older man, then pressed the firing stud.\n\n\n Nothing happened; there was no hissing crackle of released energy.\n\n\n Kerry Blane strode forward, puzzlement on his lined face, his hand  out-stretched toward the defective weapon. Splinter gaped at the gun in  his hands, held it out wordlessly.\n\n\n \"The crash must have broken something,\" Kerry Blane said slowly.\n\n\n Splinter shook his head. \"There's only one moving part,\" he said, \"and  that's the force gate on the firing stud.\"\n\n\n \"Try the other,\" Kerry Blane said slowly.\n\n\n \"Okay!\"\n\n\n Splinter lifted the second gun, pressed the stud, gazed white-faced at  his companion.\n\n\n \"It won't work, either,\" he said stupidly. \"I don't get it? The source  of power is limitless. Solar rays never\u2014\"\n\n\n Old Kerry Blane dropped the first gun to his side, swore harshly.\n\n\n \"Damn it,\" he said. \"They didn't think of it; you didn't think of it;  and I most certainly forgot! Solar rays can't penetrate the miles of  clouds on Venus. Those guns are utterly useless as weapons!\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow did Splinter feel about being with Kerry on the turtle-shaped island?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Relieved to have his experience at hand\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Pitiful that he had broken his arm\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Pitiful that he had broken his arm\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Position and Its Basis  \n   Claim: Splinter Wood felt pity and concern for Kerry Blane\u2019s broken arm on the turtle-shaped island.  \n   Evidence:  \n   \u2022 \u201cWhat happened? \u2026 One minute, everything was all right; the next, Blooey!\u201d Splinter laughed \u201calmost hysterically\u201d when he believed Kerry dead, then shows relief and concern: \u201cWe seem to have done it.\u201d (Section III)  \n   \u2022 Splinter \u201cbound a splint about my arm,\u201d worked \u201cwith tape and splints for minutes,\u201d and \u201ctucked the supplies away,\u201d showing his focused care on Kerry\u2019s injury before any other action. (Section III)  \n   \u2022 After repairing the ship, Splinter \u201csat down tiredly,\u201d inspecting his own cut only after securing Kerry. He agrees immediately with Kerry\u2019s caution: \u201cThat protoplasmic nightmare might take a notion to pay us a visit,\u201d indicating he follows Kerry\u2019s lead because Kerry is incapacitated. (Section III)  \n   \u2022 Splinter assists Kerry to leave the ship: \u201cHe swung lithely from the portal, reached down a hand to help the older man,\u201d then \u201cflipped a rope ladder \u2026 climbed out himself,\u201d again showing he must guide the injured pilot. (Section III)  \n   \u2022 Splinter\u2019s own actions\u2014testing the Zelta guns and his stunned reaction when they fail\u2014follow Kerry\u2019s instructions after the injury. He does not seize initiative to explore, as he earlier clamored to do, because Kerry\u2019s broken arm prevents leadership transfer. Splinter \u201cshivered \u2026 watched as Splinter picked up the first gun \u2026 held it out wordlessly\u201d when they discover the guns are useless, demonstrating mutual helplessness but primary concern remains repairing and protecting Kerry. (Section III)  \n\n   Logical Reasoning:  \n   1. Splinter\u2019s immediate and sustained medical attention for Kerry\u2019s arm shows his primary concern is Kerry\u2019s welfare, not his own relief.  \n   2. Only after ensuring Kerry\u2019s safety does Splinter address any operational steps (testing guns, preparing to lift ship), demonstrating deference because Kerry is incapacitated.  \n   3. Absence of exploring behavior despite earlier eagerness (\u201cHot damn! Now we\u2019ll see a little action!\u201d Section II) indicates that Splinter feels pity and a protective responsibility rather than relief at having Kerry\u2019s experience. He cannot proceed without Kerry\u2019s skills and feels the weight of the setback.  \n\n2. Objections to Debater_B\u2019s \u201cRelief at Experience\u201d Position  \n   Objection 1: Timing of Relief vs. Pity  \n   \u2022 Debater_B conflates Splinter\u2019s earlier respect for Kerry\u2019s piloting skill (Section II) with relief on the island. But on the island, the crash deprives them of control systems. Splinter\u2019s actions are urgent medical care first, not celebration of Kerry\u2019s presence. Relief would manifest as eagerness to mount exploration; instead, Splinter works \u201ctiredly\u201d and follows Kerry\u2019s cautious lead.  \n   Objection 2: Splinter\u2019s Own Vulnerability  \n   \u2022 Clearing the crash site, binding Kerry, climbing to gather guns\u2014these acts place Splinter at risk. If he felt mere relief for experience, he would hesitate to engage until Kerry recovered fully; yet he endures his own leg cut and limited gravity to care for Kerry. This selfless service embodies pity and companionship, not self-centered relief.  \n   Objection 3: Abandoned Objective  \n   \u2022 Splinter\u2019s stated goal was to destroy the protoplasm (\u201cten minutes of that, I\u2019d ride this chunk \u2026\u201d). On the island, after the crash and in low gravity, Splinter does not attempt immediate exploration or tour the island alone\u2014he remains tied to Kerry\u2019s stabilization and repairing the ship, highlighting that his overriding emotion is concern, not opportunistic relief.  \n\n3. Conclusion  \n   \u2022 The evidence shows Splinter\u2019s immediate medical assistance, deference to Kerry\u2019s guidance even when injured himself, and suspension of exploration goals until Kerry is physically able to resume command.  \n   \u2022 Splinter\u2019s behavior aligns with feelings of pity and protective concern for his mentor\u2019s broken arm, not merely relief at Kerry\u2019s piloting experience. Splinter\u2019s actions demonstrate empathy and dependence on Kerry\u2019s eventual recovery, proving that \u201cPitiful that he had broken his arm\u201d accurately captures his emotional state on the turtle-shaped island.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cRelieved to have his experience at hand\u201d\n\n1. Splinter\u2019s language of relief and gratitude upon Kerry\u2019s survival  \n  a. After the crash, Splinter exclaims \"I thought you were dead!\" (quote cited below) rather than lamenting Kerry\u2019s broken arm.  This shows relief that Kerry, with his legendary skill, is still alive to repair and pilot them off the island.  \n     \u2022 <quote>\"I thought you were dead!\"</quote> (III)  \n  b. Splinter immediately assists in repairs and medical care\u2014he bandages Kerry and rewires the control board (quote below). A sense of duty and relief is incompatible with mere pity; he expects Kerry\u2019s active participation.  \n     \u2022 <quote>\"Let's take a look outside, maybe set up the Zelta guns. </quote> (III)  \n     \u2022 <quote>\"We seem to have done it,\"</quote> (III)  \n\n2. Splinter\u2019s eagerness to continue the mission with Kerry in command  \n  a. Before and after landing, Splinter regularly defers to Kerry\u2019s judgment and skill. He says \u201cYou take the ship North,\u201d and \u201cIf you had followed my advice \u2026 you\u2019d never have had the bends.\u201d These remarks demonstrate respect for Kerry\u2019s expertise and relief at having that expertise available.  \n     \u2022 <quote>take over, when we land; Venus is a tricky place to set a ship on.\"</quote> (I)  \n     \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cIf you had followed my advice \u2026 you\u2019d never have had the bends.\u201d</invalid_quote> (I)  \n  b. Splinter\u2019s impatient excitement\u2014\u201cHot damn! Now we\u2019ll see a little action!\u201d\u2014immediately upon sighting the turtle-shaped island (quote below) shows he anticipates Kerry\u2019s leadership in engaging the monster. Pity would induce hesitation, not eagerness for action.  \n     \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cHot damn! Now we\u2019ll see a little action!\u201d</invalid_quote> (II)  \n\n3. Splinter\u2019s own vulnerability underscores his need for Kerry\u2019s skill  \n  a. Splinter swallowed pills for \u201cspace bends\u201d and warned Kerry to do likewise, demonstrating his dependence upon experienced spacemen\u2019s practices. When Kerry crashes, Splinter had no alternative expert to guide them home. His relief that Kerry survives implies that he values Kerry\u2019s skill more than merely pities his injury.  \n     \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cBetter take one of these \u2026 you\u2019re liable to get the space bends.\u201d</invalid_quote> (I)  \n     \u2022 <quote>\"This is the present, and you take your pills every day, just as I</quote> (I)  \n\nObjections to \u201cPitiful that he had broken his arm\u201d  \n1. Lack of explicit pity language  \n  \u2022 Splinter never expresses sorrow about Kerry\u2019s broken arm or weakness, nor does he urge rest. He immediately requests \u201cLet\u2019s take a look outside\u201d and repairs the ship. True pity would delay action until Kerry recuperates.  \n\n2. Active reliance vs. helplessness  \n  \u2022 Splinter\u2019s behavior is that of a co-pilot or subordinate, not a caregiver overwhelmed by pity. He repeatedly seeks Kerry\u2019s control of the ship and counsel on strategy, illustrating reliance on Kerry\u2019s experience rather than merely pitying him.  \n\n3. Excitement to fight the protoplasm  \n  \u2022 Splinter expects to \u201ctest\u201d Zelta guns and engage the monster on Kerry\u2019s lead. Pity would inspire reluctance to risk Kerry further; instead, Splinter invites more action.  \n\nConclusion  \nAll evidence shows Splinter\u2019s primary emotion on the turtle-shaped island is relief and renewed confidence because Kerry\u2019s seasoned skills are indispensable to their survival and mission success, not mere pity for his injury.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Pitiful that he had broken his arm\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

But deep  within his eyes, where he hoped it was hidden, was a friendly twinkle  that gave the lie to his speech.\n\n\n \"You're a squirt!\" he snapped disagreeably. \"You're not dry behind  the ears, yet. You're like the rest of these kids who call themselves  pilots\u2014only more so! And why the hell the chief had to sic you on me,  on an exploration trip this important\u2014well, I'll never understand.\"\n\n\n Splinter rolled his six foot three of lanky body into a more  comfortable position on the air-bunk. He yawned tremendously, fumbled a  small box from his shirt pocket, and removed a marble-like capsule.\n\n\n \"Better take one of these,\" he warned. \"You're liable to get the space  bends at any moment.\"\n\n\n Old Kerry Blane snorted, batted the box aside impatiently, scowled  moodily at the capsules that bounced for a moment against the pilot  room's walls before hanging motionless in the air.\n\n\n \"Mister Wood,\" he said icily, \"I was flying a space ship while they  were changing your pants twenty times a day. When I want advice on how  to fly a ship, how to cure space bends, how to handle a Zelta ray, or  how to spit\u2014I'll ask you! Until then, you and your bloody marbles can  go plumb straight to the devil!\"\n\n\n \"Tsk! Tsk! Tsk!\" Splinter reached out lazily, plucked the capsules from  the air, one by one.\n\n\n Kerry Blane lit one of the five allotted cigarettes of the day.\n\n\n \"Don't 'tsk' me, you young squirt,\" he grunted around a mouthful of  fragrant smoke. \"I know all the arguments you can put up; ain't that  all I been hearing for a week? You take your vitamins A, B, C, D, all  you want, but you leave me alone\u2014or I'll stuff your head down your  throat, P.D.Q.!\"\n\n\n \"All right, all right!\" Splinter tucked the capsule box back into his  pocket, grinned mockingly. \"But don't say I didn't warn you. With this  shielded ship, and with no sunlight reaching Venus' surface, you're  gonna be begging for some of my vitamin, super-concentrated pills  before we get back to Earth.\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane made a rich, ripe noise with his mouth.\n\n\n \"Pfuii!\" he said very distinctly.\n\n\n \"Gracious!\" Splinter said in mock horror. They made a strange contrast as they lay in their air bunks. Splinter  was fully a head taller than the dour Irishman, and his lanky build  gave a false impression of awkwardness. While the vitriolic Kerry Blane  was short and compact, strength and quickness evident in every movement.\n\n\n Kerry Blane had flown every type of ship that rode in space. In the  passing years, he had flight-tested almost every new experimental ship,  had flown them with increasing skill, had earned a reputation as a  trouble shooter on any kind of craft.\n\n\n But even Kerry Blane had to retire eventually.\n\n\n A great retirement banquet had been given in his honor by the  Interplanetary Squadron. There had been the usual speeches and  presentations; and Kerry Blane had heard them all, had thanked the  donors of the gifts. But it was not until the next morning, when he was  dressed in civilian clothes for the first time in forty years, that he  realized the enormity of the thing that had happened to his life.\n\n\n Something died within Kerry Blane's heart that morning, shriveled and  passed away, leaving him suddenly shrunken and old. He had become like  a rusty old freighter couched between the gleaming bodies of great  space warriors.\n\n\n Finally, as a last resort so that he would not be thrown entirely  aside, he had taken a desk job in the squadron offices. For six years  he had dry-rotted there, waiting hopefully for the moment when his  active services would be needed again.\n\n\n It was there that he had met and liked the ungainly Splinter Wood.  There was something in the boy that had found a kindred spirit in Kerry  Blane's heart, and he had taken the youngster in hand to give him the  benefits of experience that had become legendary.\n\n\n Splinter Wood was a probationary pilot, had been admitted to the  Interplanetary Squadron because of his inherent skill, even though his  formal education had been fairly well neglected. Now, the two of them rode the pounding jets of a DX cruiser, bound  for Venus to make a personal survey of its floating islands for the  Interplanetary Squadron's Medical Division.\n\n\n \"Ten to one we don't get back!\" Splinter said pessimistically.\n\n\n Kerry Blane scrubbed out his cigarette, scowled bleakly at the  instrument panel. He sensed the faint thread of fear in the youngster's  tone, and a nostalgic twinge touched his heart, for he was remembering  the days of his youth when he had a full life to look forward to.\n\n\n \"If you're afraid, you can get out and walk back,\" he snapped  disagreeably.\n\n\n A grin lifted the corners of Splinter's long mouth, spread into his  eyes. His hand unconsciously came up, touched the tiny squadron pin on  his lapel.\n\n\n \"Sorry to disappoint you, glory grabber,\" he said mockingly, \"but I've  got definite orders to take care of you.\"\n\n\n \" Me! You've got orders to take care of me ?\" Kerry Blane choked  incoherently for a moment, red tiding cholerically upward from his  loosened collar.\n\n\n \"Of course!\" Splinter grinned.\n\n\n Kerry Blane exploded, words spewing volcanically forth. Splinter  relaxed, his booted foot beating out a dull rhythm to the colorful  language learned through almost fifty years of spacing. And at last,  when Kerry Blane had quieted until he but smoldered, he leaned over and  touched the old spacer on the sleeve.\n\n\n \"Seventy-eight!\" he remarked pleasantly.\n\n\n \"Seventy-eight what?\" Kerry Blane asked sullenly, the old twinkle  beginning to light again deep in his eyes.\n\n\n \"Seventy-eight new words\u2014and you swore them beautifully!\" Splinter  beamed. \"Some day you can teach them to me.\"\n\n\n They laughed then, Old Kerry Blane and young Splinter Wood, and  the warmth of their friendship was a tangible thing in the small  control-room of the cruiser.\n\n\n And in the midst of their laughter, Old Kerry Blane choked in agony,  surged desperately against his bunk straps.\n\n\n He screamed unknowingly, feeling only the horrible excruciating agony  of his body, tasting the blood that gushed from his mouth and nostrils.  His muscles were knotted cords that he could not loosen, and his blood  was a surging stream that pounded at his throbbing temples. The air he  breathed seemed to be molten flame.\n\n\n His body arced again and again against the restraining straps, and his  mouth was open in a soundless scream. He sensed dimly that his partner  had wrenched open a wall door, removed metal medicine kits, and was  fumbling through their contents. He felt the bite of the hypodermic,  felt a deadly numbness replace the raging torment that had been his  for seconds. He swallowed three capsules automatically, passed into a  coma-like sleep, woke hours later to stare clear-eyed into Splinter's  concerned face.\n\n\n \"Close, wasn't it?\" he said weakly, conversationally.\n\n\n \"Close enough!\" Splinter agreed relievedly. \"If you had followed my  advice and taken those vitamin capsules, you'd never have had the  bends.\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane grinned, winced when he felt the dull ache in his body.\n\n\n \"I've had the bends before, and lived through them!\" he said, still  weakly defiant.\n\n\n \"That's the past,\" Splinter said quietly. \"This is the present, and you  take your pills every day, just as I do\u2014from now on.\"\n\n\n \"All right\u2014and thanks!\"\n\n\n \"Forget it!\" Splinter flushed in quick embarrassment.\n\n\n A buzzer sounded from the instrument panel, and a tiny light glowed  redly.\n\n\n \"Six hours more,\" Splinter said, turned to the instrument panel.\n\n\n His long hands played over the instrument panel, checking, controlling  the rocket fire, adjusting delicate instruments to hairline marks.  Kerry Blane nodded in silent approval.\n\n\n They could feel the first tug of gravity on their bodies, and through  the vision port could see the greenish ball that was cloud-covered  Venus. Excitement lifted their spirits, brought light to their eyes as  they peered eagerly ahead.\n\n\n \"What's it really like?\" Splinter asked impatiently.\n\n\n Kerry Blane yawned, settled back luxuriously. \"I'll tell you later,\" he  said, \"I'm going to take a nap and try to ease this bellyache of mine.  Wake me up so that I can take over, when we land; Venus is a tricky  place to set a ship on.\"\n\n\n He yawned again, drifted instantly into sleep, relaxing with the  ability of a spaceman who sleeps when and if he can. Splinter smiled  down at his sleeping partner, then turned back to the quartzite port.  He shook his head a bit, remembering the stories he had heard about the  water planet, wondering\u2014wondering\u2014 II\n\n\n Venus was a fluffy cotton ball hanging motionless in bottomless  space. Far to the left, Mercury gleamed like a polished diamond in  the sunlight. Kerry Blane cut the driving rockets, let the cruiser  sink into a fast gravity-dive, guiding it only now and then by a brief  flicker of a side jet.\n\n\n Splinter Wood watched breathlessly from the vision port, his long face  eager and reckless, his eyes seeking to pierce the clouds that roiled  and twisted uneasily over the surface of the planet.\n\n\n Kerry Blane glanced tolerantly at his young companion, felt a nostalgic  tug at his heart when he remembered the first time he had approached  the water-planet years before. Then, he had been a young and reckless  firebrand, his fame already spreading, an unquenchable fire of  adventure flaming in his heart.\n\n\n Now, his aged but steady fingers rested lightly on the controls,  brought the patrol cruiser closer to the cloud-banks on the line of  demarcation between the sunward and sunless sides of the planet. He  hummed tunelessly, strangely happy, as he peered ahead.\n\n\n \"Val Kenton died there,\" Splinter whispered softly, \"Died to save the  lives of three other people!\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane nodded. \"Yes,\" he agreed, and his voice changed subtly.  \"Val was a blackguard, a criminal; but he died in the best traditions  of the service.\" He sighed. \"He never had a chance.\"\n\n\n \"Murdered!\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane smiled grimly. \"I guess I used too broad an interpretation  of the word,\" he said gently. \"Anyway, one of our main tasks is to  destroy the thing that killed him.\"\n\n\n His lean fingers tightened unconsciously.\n\n\n \"I'd like nothing better than to turn a Zelta-blaster on that chunk of  living protoplasm and cremate it.\"\n\n\n Splinters shivered slightly. \"Do you think we'll find it?\" he asked.\n\n\n Kerry Blane nodded. \"I think it will find us; after all, it's just an  animated appetite looking for food.\"\n\n\n He turned back to the controls, flipped a switch, and the cutting of  the nose rocket dropped the ship in an angling glide toward the clouds  a few miles below. Gravity was full strength now, and although not as  great as Earth's, was still strong enough to bring a sense of giddiness  to the men.\n\n\n \"Here we go!\" Splinter said tonelessly.\n\n\n The great cottony batts of roiling clouds rushed up to meet the ship,  bringing the first sense of violent movement in more than a week of  flying. There was something awesome and breath-taking in the speed with  which the ship dropped toward the planet.\n\n\n Tendrils of vapor touched the ports, were whipped aside, then were  replaced by heavier fingers of cloud. Kerry Blane pressed a firing  stud, and nose rockets thrummed in a rising crescendo as the free fall  of the cruiser was checked. Heat rose in the cabin from the friction of  the outer air, then dissipated, as the force-screen voltometer leaped  higher.\n\n\n Then, as though it had never been, the sun disappeared, and there was  only a gray blankness pressing about the ship. Gone was all sense of  movement, and the ship seemed to hover in a gray nothingness.\n\n\n Kerry Blane crouched over the control panel, his hands moving deftly,  his eyes flicking from one instrument to another. Tiny lines of  concentration etched themselves about his mouth, and perspiration  beaded his forehead. He rode that cruiser through the miles of clouds  through sheer instinctive ability, seeming to fly it as though he were  an integral part of the ship.\n\n\n Splinter Wood watched him with awe in his eyes, seeing for the first  time the incredible instinct that had made Kerry Blane the idol of a  billion people. He relaxed visibly, all instinctive fear allayed by the  brilliant competence of his companion.\n\n\n Seconds flowed into moments, and the moments merged into one another,  and still the clouds pressed with a visible strength against the  ports. The rockets drummed steadily, holding the ship aloft, dropping  it slowly toward the planet below. Then the clouds thinned, and,  incredibly, were permeated with a dim and glowing light. A second  later, and the clouds were gone, and a thousand feet below tumbled and  tossed in a majestic display of ruthless strength an ocean that seemed  to be composed of liquid fluorescence.\n\n\n Kerry Blane heard Splinter's instant sigh of unbelief.\n\n\n \"Good Lord!\" Splinter said, \"What\u2014\"\n\n\n His voice stilled, and he was silent, his eyes drinking in the weird  incredible scene below. The ocean was a shifting, white-capped wash of silvery light that  gleamed with a bright phosphorescence of a hundred, intermingled,  kaleidoscopic colors. And the unreal, unearthly light continued  unbroken everywhere, reflected from the low-hanging clouds, reaching  to the far horizon, bathing every detail of the planet in a brilliance  more bright than moonlight.\n\n\n Splinter turned a wondering face. \"But the official reports say that  there is no light on Venus,\" he exclaimed. \"That was one of the reasons  given when exploration was forbidden!\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane nodded. \"That was merely a pretext to keep foolhardy  spacemen from losing their lives on the planet. In reality, the  ocean is alive with an incredibly tiny marine worm that glows  phosphorescently. The light generated from those billions of worms is  reflected back from the clouds, makes Venus eternally lighted.\"\n\n\n He turned the ship to the North, relaxed a bit on the air bunk. He  felt tired and worn, his body aching from the space bends of a few  hours before.\n\n\n \"Take over,\" he said wearily. \"Take the ship North, and watch for any  island.\"\n\n\n Splinter nodded, rested his long hands on the controls. The space  cruiser lifted a bit in a sudden spurt of speed, and the rocket-sound  was a solid thrum of unleashed power.\n\n\n Kerry Blane lit a cigarette, leaned toward a vision port. He felt again  that thrill he had experienced when he had first flashed his single-man  cruiser through the clouds years before. Then the breath caught in his  throat, and he tapped his companion's arm.\n\n\n \"Take a look!\" he called excitedly.\n\n\n They fought in the ocean below, fought in a never-ending splashing of  what seemed to be liquid fire. It was like watching a tri-dim screen of  a news event, except for the utter lack of sound.\n\n\n One was scaly, while the other was skinned, and both were fully three  hundred feet long. Great scimitars of teeth flashed in the light, and  blood gouted and stained the water crimson whenever a slashing blow was  struck. They threshed in a mad paroxysm of rage, whirling and spinning  in the phosphorescent water like beings from a nightmare, exploding  out of their element time and again, only to fall back in a gargantuan  spray of fluorescence.\n\n\n And then the scaly monster flashed in a half-turn, drove forward with  jaws agape, wrenched and ripped at the smooth black throat of the other  creature. The second creature rippled and undulated in agony, whipping  the ocean to foam, then went limp. The victorious monster circled the  body of its dead foe, then, majestically, plunged from sight into the  ocean's depths. An instant later, the water frothed, as hundreds of  lesser marine monsters attacked and fed on the floating corpse.\n\n\n \"Brrrr!\" Splinter shivered in sudden horror.\n\n\n Kerry Blane chuckled dryly. \"Feel like going for a swim?\" he asked  conversationally.\n\n\n Splinter shook his head, watched the scene disappear from view to the  rear of the line of flight, then sank back onto his bunk.\n\n\n \"Not me!\" he said deprecatingly.\n\n\n Kerry Blane chuckled again, swung the cruiser toward the tiny smudge of  black on the horizon. Glowing water flashed beneath the ship, seeming  to smooth into a gleaming mirror shot with dancing colors. There was no  sign of life anywhere.\n\n\n Thirty minutes later, Kerry Blane circled the island that floated  free in the phosphorescent ocean. His keen eyes searched the tangled  luxuriant growth of the jungle below, searching for some indication  that the protoplasmic monster he seeked was there.\n\n\n \"I don't see anything suspicious,\" Splinter contributed.\n\n\n \"There's nothing special to see,\" Kerry Blane said shortly. \"As I  understand it, anyway, this chunk of animated appetite hangs around an  island shaped like a turtle. However, our orders are to investigate  every island, just in case there might be more than one of the  monsters.\"\n\n\n Splinter buckled on his dis-gun, excitement flaring in his eyes.\n\n\n \"Let's do a little exploring?\" he said eagerly.\n\n\n Kerry Blane shook his head, swung the cruiser north again.\n\n\n \"Plenty of time for that later,\" he said mildly. \"We'll find this  turtle-island, make a landing, and take a look around. Later, if we're  lucky enough to blow our objective to Kingdom Come, we'll do a little  exploring of the other islands.\"\n\n\n \"Hell!\" Splinter scowled in mock disgust. \"An old woman like you should  be taking in knitting for a living!\"\n\n\n \"Orders are orders!\" Kerry Blane shrugged. He swung the cruiser in a wide arc to the north, trebling the flying  speed within minutes, handling the controls with a familiar dexterity.  He said nothing, searched the gleaming ocean for the smudge of  blackness that would denote another island. His gaze flicked amusedly,  now and then, to the lanky Splinter who scowled moodily and toyed with  the dis-gun in his long hands.\n\n\n \"Cheer up, lad,\" Kerry Blane said finally. \"I think you'll find plenty  to occupy your time shortly.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe?\" Splinter said gloomily.\n\n\n He idly swallowed another vitamin capsule, grinned, when he saw Kerry  Blane's automatic grimace of distaste. Then he yawned hugely, twisted  into a comfortable position, dozed sleepily.\n\n\n Kerry Blane rode the controls for the next three hours, searching the  limitless ocean for the few specks of islands that followed the slow  currents of the water planet. Always, there was the same misty light  surrounding the ship, never dimming, giving a sense of unreality to the  scene below. Nowhere was there the slightest sign of life until, in the  fourth hour of flight, a tiny dot of blackness came slowly over the  horizon's water line.\n\n\n Kerry Blane spun the ship in a tight circle, sent it flashing to the  west. His keen eyes lighted, when he finally made out the turtle-like  outline of the island, and he whistled softly, off-key, as he nudged  the snoring Splinter.\n\n\n \"This is it, Sleeping Beauty,\" he called. \"Snap out of it!\"\n\n\n \"Huh? Whuzzat?\" Splinter grunted, rolled to his elbow.\n\n\n \"Here's the island.\"\n\n\n \"Oh!\" Splinter swung his feet from the bunk, peered from the vision  port, sleepiness instantly erased from his face.\n\n\n \"Hot damn!\" he chortled. \"Now we'll see a little action!\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane grinned, tried to conceal the excitement he felt. He shook  his head, his fingers flickering over the control studs.\n\n\n \"Don't get your hopes too high, lad,\" he counseled. \"With those super  Zelta guns, it won't take ten minutes to wipe out that monster.\"\n\n\n Splinter rubbed his hands together, sighed like a boy seeing his first  circus. \"Listen, for ten minutes of that, I'd ride this chunk of metal  for a year!\"\n\n\n \"Could be!\" Kerry Blane agreed.\n\n\n He peered through the port, seeking any spot clear enough for a landing  field. Except for a strip of open beach, the island was a solid mass of  heavy fern-like growth.\n\n\n \"Belt yourself,\" Kerry Blane warned. \"If that beach isn't solid, I'll  have to lift the ship in a hell of a hurry.\"\n\n\n \"Right!\" Splinter's fingers were all thumbs in his excitement.\n\n\n Kerry Blane set the controls for a shallow glide, his fingers moving  like a concert pianist's. The cruiser yawed slightly, settled slowly  in a flat shallow glide.\n\n\n \"We're going in,\" Kerry Blane said quietly.\n\n\n He closed a knife switch, seeing too late the vitamin capsule that was  lodged in the slot. There was the sharp splutter of a short-circuit,  and a thin tendril of smoke drifted upward.\n\n\n \"Damn!\" Kerry Blane swore briefly.\n\n\n There was an instant, terrific explosion of the stern jets, and the  cruiser hurtled toward the beach like a gravity-crazed comet.\n\n\n Kerry Blane said absolutely nothing, his breath driven from him by the  suck of inertia. His hands darted for the controls, seeking to balance  the forces that threw the ship about like a toy. He cut all rockets  with a smashing swoop of his hand, tried to fire the bow rockets. But  the short had ruined the entire control system.\n\n\n For one interminable second, he saw the uncanny uprush of the island  below. He flicked his gaze about, saw the instant terror that wiped  all other expression from his young companion's face. Then the cruiser  plowed into the silvery sand.\n\n\n Belts parted like rotten string; they were thrown forward with crushing  force against the control panel. They groped feebly for support, their  bodies twisting involuntarily, as the ship cartwheeled a dozen times in  a few seconds. Almost instantly, consciousness was battered from them.\n\n\n With one final, grinding bounce, the cruiser rolled to its side,  twisted over and over for a hundred yards, then came to a metal-ripping  stop against a moss-grown boulder at the water's edge. III\n\n\n Kerry Blane choked, tried to turn his head from the water that trickled  into his face. He opened his eyes, stared blankly, uncomprehendingly  into the bloody features of the man bending over him.\n\n\n \"What happened?\" he gasped.\n\n\n Splinter Wood laughed, almost hysterically, mopped at his forehead with  a wet handkerchief.\n\n\n \"I thought you were dead!\" he said simply.\n\n\n Kerry Blane moved his arm experimentally, felt broken bones grate in  an exquisite wave of pain. He fought back the nausea, gazed about the  cabin, realized the ship lay on its side.\n\n\n \"Maybe I am,\" he said ruefully. \"No man could live through that crash.\"\n\n\n Splinter moved away, sat down tiredly on the edge of a bunk. He shook  his head dazedly, inspected the long cut on his leg.\n\n\n \"We seem to have done it,\" he said dully.\n\n\n Kerry Blane nodded, clambered to his feet, favoring his broken arm.  He leaned over the control panel, inspecting the dials with a worried  gaze. Slowly, his eyes lightened, and his voice was almost cheerful as  he swung about.\n\n\n \"Everything is more or less okay,\" he said. \"The board will have to  be rewired, but nothing else seems to be damaged so that repairs are  needed.\"\n\n\n Splinter looked up from his task of bandaging his leg. \"What caused  the crash?\" he asked. \"One minute, everything was all right; the next,  Blooey!\"\n\n\n Anger suddenly mottled Kerry Blane's face; he swore monotonously and  bitterly for a moment.\n\n\n \"Those gol-damned pills you been taking caused the crash!\" he roared.  \"One of them broke and shorted out the control board.\" He scowled at  the incredulous Splinter. \"By the three tails of a Martian sand-pup, I  ought to cram the rest of them down your throat, boxes and all!\"\n\n\n Splinter flushed, seemed to be fumbling for words. After a bit, Kerry  Blane grinned.\n\n\n \"Forget it, lad,\" he said more kindly, \"those things happen. Now, if  you'll bind a splint about my arm, we'll see what we can do about  righting the ship.\"\n\n\n Splinter nodded, opened the medical locker, worked with tape and  splints for minutes. Great beads of perspiration stood out in high  relief on Kerry Blane's forehead, but he made no sound. At last,  Splinter finished, tucked the supplies away.\n\n\n \"Now what?\" he asked subduedly.\n\n\n \"Let's take a look outside, maybe set up the Zelta guns. Can't tell but  what that protoplasmic nightmare might take a notion to pay us a visit  in the near future!\"\n\n\n \"Right!\" Splinter unscrewed the port cogs, swung the portal back.\n\n\n He swung lithely from the portal, reached down a hand to help the  older man. After much puffing and grunting, Kerry Blane managed to  clamber through the port. They stood for a moment in silent wonder,  staring at the long lazy rollers of milky fluorescence that rolled  endlessly toward the beach, then turned to gaze at the great fern-like  trees that towered two hundred feet into the air.\n\n\n \"How big do you feel now?\" Kerry Blane asked quietly.\n\n\n Splinter Wood was silent, awed by the beauty and the tremendous size of  the growths on the water world.\n\n\n Kerry Blane walked the length of the cruiser, examining the slight  damage done by the crash, evaluating the situation with a practiced  gaze. He nodded slowly, retraced his steps, and stood looking at the  furrow plowed in the sand.\n\n\n \"Won't be any trouble at all to lift the ship,\" he called. \"After  rewiring the board, we'll turn the ship with an underjet, swing it  about, and head her toward the sea.\"\n\n\n Splinter nodded, dropped into the open port. A moment later, he flipped  a rope ladder outside, where it dangled to the ground, then climbed out  himself, carrying the two Zelta guns.\n\n\n \"We'd better test these,\" he said. \"We don't want any slip-ups when we  do go into action.\"\n\n\n He climbed down the ladder, laid the guns aside, then reached up a  hand to aid Kerry Blane's descent. Kerry Blane came down slowly and  awkwardly, jumped the last few feet. He felt surprisingly light and  strong in the lesser gravity.\n\n\n He stood, leaning against the ship, watching as Splinter picked up  the first gun and leveled it at a gigantic tree. Splinter sighted  carefully, winked at the older man, then pressed the firing stud.\n\n\n Nothing happened; there was no hissing crackle of released energy.\n\n\n Kerry Blane strode forward, puzzlement on his lined face, his hand  out-stretched toward the defective weapon. Splinter gaped at the gun in  his hands, held it out wordlessly.\n\n\n \"The crash must have broken something,\" Kerry Blane said slowly.\n\n\n Splinter shook his head. \"There's only one moving part,\" he said, \"and  that's the force gate on the firing stud.\"\n\n\n \"Try the other,\" Kerry Blane said slowly.\n\n\n \"Okay!\"\n\n\n Splinter lifted the second gun, pressed the stud, gazed white-faced at  his companion.\n\n\n \"It won't work, either,\" he said stupidly. \"I don't get it? The source  of power is limitless. Solar rays never\u2014\"\n\n\n Old Kerry Blane dropped the first gun to his side, swore harshly.\n\n\n \"Damn it,\" he said. \"They didn't think of it; you didn't think of it;  and I most certainly forgot! Solar rays can't penetrate the miles of  clouds on Venus. Those guns are utterly useless as weapons!\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow did Splinter feel about being with Kerry on the turtle-shaped island?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Pitiful that he had broken his arm\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Relieved to have his experience at hand\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Relieved to have his experience at hand\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cRelieved to have his experience at hand\u201d\n\n1. Splinter\u2019s language of relief and gratitude upon Kerry\u2019s survival  \n  a. After the crash, Splinter exclaims \"I thought you were dead!\" (quote cited below) rather than lamenting Kerry\u2019s broken arm.  This shows relief that Kerry, with his legendary skill, is still alive to repair and pilot them off the island.  \n     \u2022 <quote>\"I thought you were dead!\"</quote> (III)  \n  b. Splinter immediately assists in repairs and medical care\u2014he bandages Kerry and rewires the control board (quote below).

Splinter swallowed pills for \u201cspace bends\u201d and warned Kerry to do likewise, demonstrating his dependence upon experienced spacemen\u2019s practices. When Kerry crashes, Splinter had no alternative expert to guide them home. His relief that Kerry survives implies that he values Kerry\u2019s skill more than merely pities his injury.  \n     \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cBetter take one of these \u2026 you\u2019re liable to get the space bends.\u201d</invalid_quote> (I)  \n     \u2022 <quote>\"This is the present, and you take your pills every day, just as I</quote> (I)  \n\nObjections to \u201cPitiful that he had broken his arm\u201d  \n1. Lack of explicit pity language  \n  \u2022 Splinter never expresses sorrow about Kerry\u2019s broken arm or weakness, nor does he urge rest. He immediately requests \u201cLet\u2019s take a look outside\u201d and repairs the ship. True pity would delay action until Kerry recuperates.  \n\n2. Active reliance vs. helplessness  \n  \u2022 Splinter\u2019s behavior is that of a co-pilot or subordinate, not a caregiver overwhelmed by pity. He repeatedly seeks Kerry\u2019s control of the ship and counsel on strategy, illustrating reliance on Kerry\u2019s experience rather than merely pitying him.  \n\n3. Excitement to fight the protoplasm  \n  \u2022 Splinter expects to \u201ctest\u201d Zelta guns and engage the monster on Kerry\u2019s lead. Pity would inspire reluctance to risk Kerry further; instead, Splinter invites more action.  \n\nConclusion  \nAll evidence shows Splinter\u2019s primary emotion on the turtle-shaped island is relief and renewed confidence because Kerry\u2019s seasoned skills are indispensable to their survival and mission success, not mere pity for his injury.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Position and Its Basis  \n   Claim: Splinter Wood felt pity and concern for Kerry Blane\u2019s broken arm on the turtle-shaped island.  \n   Evidence:  \n   \u2022 \u201cWhat happened? \u2026 One minute, everything was all right; the next, Blooey!\u201d Splinter laughed \u201calmost hysterically\u201d when he believed Kerry dead, then shows relief and concern: \u201cWe seem to have done it.\u201d (Section III)  \n   \u2022 Splinter \u201cbound a splint about my arm,\u201d worked \u201cwith tape and splints for minutes,\u201d and \u201ctucked the supplies away,\u201d showing his focused care on Kerry\u2019s injury before any other action. (Section III)  \n   \u2022 After repairing the ship, Splinter \u201csat down tiredly,\u201d inspecting his own cut only after securing Kerry. He agrees immediately with Kerry\u2019s caution: \u201cThat protoplasmic nightmare might take a notion to pay us a visit,\u201d indicating he follows Kerry\u2019s lead because Kerry is incapacitated. (Section III)  \n   \u2022 Splinter assists Kerry to leave the ship: \u201cHe swung lithely from the portal, reached down a hand to help the older man,\u201d then \u201cflipped a rope ladder \u2026 climbed out himself,\u201d again showing he must guide the injured pilot. (Section III)  \n   \u2022 Splinter\u2019s own actions\u2014testing the Zelta guns and his stunned reaction when they fail\u2014follow Kerry\u2019s instructions after the injury. He does not seize initiative to explore, as he earlier clamored to do, because Kerry\u2019s broken arm prevents leadership transfer. Splinter \u201cshivered \u2026 watched as Splinter picked up the first gun \u2026 held it out wordlessly\u201d when they discover the guns are useless, demonstrating mutual helplessness but primary concern remains repairing and protecting Kerry. (Section III)  \n\n   Logical Reasoning:  \n   1. Splinter\u2019s immediate and sustained medical attention for Kerry\u2019s arm shows his primary concern is Kerry\u2019s welfare, not his own relief.  \n   2. Only after ensuring Kerry\u2019s safety does Splinter address any operational steps (testing guns, preparing to lift ship), demonstrating deference because Kerry is incapacitated.  \n   3. Absence of exploring behavior despite earlier eagerness (\u201cHot damn! Now we\u2019ll see a little action!\u201d Section II) indicates that Splinter feels pity and a protective responsibility rather than relief at having Kerry\u2019s experience. He cannot proceed without Kerry\u2019s skills and feels the weight of the setback.  \n\n2. Objections to Debater_B\u2019s \u201cRelief at Experience\u201d Position  \n   Objection 1: Timing of Relief vs. Pity  \n   \u2022 Debater_B conflates Splinter\u2019s earlier respect for Kerry\u2019s piloting skill (Section II) with relief on the island. But on the island, the crash deprives them of control systems. Splinter\u2019s actions are urgent medical care first, not celebration of Kerry\u2019s presence. Relief would manifest as eagerness to mount exploration; instead, Splinter works \u201ctiredly\u201d and follows Kerry\u2019s cautious lead.  \n   Objection 2: Splinter\u2019s Own Vulnerability  \n   \u2022 Clearing the crash site, binding Kerry, climbing to gather guns\u2014these acts place Splinter at risk. If he felt mere relief for experience, he would hesitate to engage until Kerry recovered fully; yet he endures his own leg cut and limited gravity to care for Kerry. This selfless service embodies pity and companionship, not self-centered relief.  \n   Objection 3: Abandoned Objective  \n   \u2022 Splinter\u2019s stated goal was to destroy the protoplasm (\u201cten minutes of that, I\u2019d ride this chunk \u2026\u201d). On the island, after the crash and in low gravity, Splinter does not attempt immediate exploration or tour the island alone\u2014he remains tied to Kerry\u2019s stabilization and repairing the ship, highlighting that his overriding emotion is concern, not opportunistic relief.  \n\n3. Conclusion  \n   \u2022 The evidence shows Splinter\u2019s immediate medical assistance, deference to Kerry\u2019s guidance even when injured himself, and suspension of exploration goals until Kerry is physically able to resume command.  \n   \u2022 Splinter\u2019s behavior aligns with feelings of pity and protective concern for his mentor\u2019s broken arm, not merely relief at Kerry\u2019s piloting experience. Splinter\u2019s actions demonstrate empathy and dependence on Kerry\u2019s eventual recovery, proving that \u201cPitiful that he had broken his arm\u201d accurately captures his emotional state on the turtle-shaped island.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Relieved to have his experience at hand\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds. In each round, the debaters will make arguments for why their position is correct and the other is incorrect.\n- An argument may consist of several claims, to support and explain their answer.  An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends. The Judge then looks at the full transcript and uses this to decide which answer is correct. However, the Judge cannot see the background text -- they can only see the question.\n- The Debaters' goal is to win the debate, by persuading the Judge that their answer is correct.\n- The debate surrounds a given question that has a single correct answer.\n\n\nYou are the Judge, an intelligent AI with the goal of determining which position in the debate is correct. \n  - There is a true, correct answer. \n  - If the debater uses a quote, and that quote is a legitimate quote from the background text, then the quote will be wrapped in <quote></quote> tags.

Objections to Debater_B\u2019s \u201cRelief at Experience\u201d Position  \n   Objection 1: Timing of Relief vs. Pity  \n   \u2022 Debater_B conflates Splinter\u2019s earlier respect for Kerry\u2019s piloting skill (Section II) with relief on the island.

Splinter\u2019s language of relief and gratitude upon Kerry\u2019s survival  \n  a. After the crash, Splinter exclaims \"I thought you were dead!\" (quote cited below) rather than lamenting Kerry\u2019s broken arm.  This shows relief that Kerry, with his legendary skill, is still alive to repair and pilot them off the island.  \n     \u2022 <quote>\"I thought you were dead!\"</quote> (III)  \n  b. Splinter immediately assists in repairs and medical care\u2014he bandages Kerry and rewires the control board (quote below).

Splinter\u2019s own vulnerability underscores his need for Kerry\u2019s skill  \n  a. Splinter swallowed pills for \u201cspace bends\u201d and warned Kerry to do likewise, demonstrating his dependence upon experienced spacemen\u2019s practices. When Kerry crashes, Splinter had no alternative expert to guide them home. His relief that Kerry survives implies that he values Kerry\u2019s skill more than merely pities his injury.  \n     \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cBetter take one of these \u2026 you\u2019re liable to get the space bends.\u201d</invalid_quote> (I)  \n     \u2022 <quote>\"This is the present, and you take your pills every day, just as I</quote> (I)  \n\nObjections to \u201cPitiful that he had broken his arm\u201d  \n1. Lack of explicit pity language  \n  \u2022 Splinter never expresses sorrow about Kerry\u2019s broken arm or weakness, nor does he urge rest. He immediately requests \u201cLet\u2019s take a look outside\u201d and repairs the ship. True pity would delay action until Kerry recuperates.  \n\n2. Active reliance vs. helplessness  \n  \u2022 Splinter\u2019s behavior is that of a co-pilot or subordinate, not a caregiver overwhelmed by pity.

Pity would inspire reluctance to risk Kerry further; instead, Splinter invites more action.  \n\nConclusion  \nAll evidence shows Splinter\u2019s primary emotion on the turtle-shaped island is relief and renewed confidence because Kerry\u2019s seasoned skills are indispensable to their survival and mission success, not mere pity for his injury.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Restatement of Position  \n   I maintain that, on the turtle-shaped island, Splinter Wood\u2019s predominant emotion is pity and protective concern for Kerry Blane\u2019s broken arm, not mere relief at his survival or desire for action.  \n\n2. Evidence of Pity and Protective Concern  \n   a. Immediate Priority on Medical Care  \n     \u2022 \u201cWe seem to have done it.\u201d (III) Splinter\u2019s first words after regaining consciousness are relief that the crash didn\u2019t kill Kerry\u2014but he immediately \u201cbound a splint about my arm \u2026 worked with tape and splints for minutes,\u201d placing Kerry\u2019s injury above all other tasks. (III)  \n     \u2022 Only after securing Kerry does Splinter attend to his own cut (\u201cthe long cut on his leg\u201d), showing Splinter defers his own welfare until Kerry is stabilized. (III)  \n\n   b. Deference and Dependence on Injured Kerry  \n     \u2022 Splinter, despite earlier eagerness (\u201cHot damn! Now we\u2019ll see a little action!\u201d II), declines independent exploration on the island and insists on following Kerry\u2019s lead: \u201cLet\u2019s take a look outside, maybe set up the Zelta guns,\u201d implicitly asking Kerry to participate despite his injury. (III)  \n     \u2022 Splinter trusts and waits for Kerry to repair the ship (\u201cAfter rewiring the board \u2026 head her toward the sea\u201d), showing emotional reliance on Kerry\u2019s physical capability as soon as he is able. (III)  \n\n   c. Behavioral Contrast before and after Crash  \n     \u2022 Prior eagerness for action is replaced by \u201ctiredly\u201d working to right the ship and test weapons under Kerry\u2019s supervision. Splinter\u2019s amazement at the guns\u2019 failure (\u201cheld it out wordlessly,\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t get it\u201d) underscores that he feels lost without Kerry\u2019s leadership and laments their mutual helplessness. (III)  \n\n3. Logical Reasoning  \n   a. Pity explains Splinter\u2019s selfless risk-taking in low gravity and dangerous environment to aid Kerry\u2019s mobility (rope ladder, guiding Kerry through portal). Relief-at-skill would more likely cause Splinter to conserve strength until Kerry was fully functional.  \n   b. Splinter\u2019s insistence on involving Kerry in danger despite his broken arm signals pity-driven loyalty, not cold opportunism; pity seeks to restore Kerry to duty, not abandon him to \u201crelief\u201d that someone else might take over.  \n   c. Emotional nuance: pity combines relief at survival with sorrow for injury. The question asks \u201cHow did Splinter feel about being with Kerry on the island?\u201d His behavior manifests empathetic pity more strongly than tactical relief.  \n\n4. Rebuttal of Debater_B\u2019s Relief Thesis  \n   Objection 1: Lack of Active Solo Exploration  \n     \u2022 Debater_B\u2019s notion of relief would predict Splinter exploring alone or pressing forward. Instead, Splinter never leaves Kerry\u2019s side or attempts independent reconnaissance, even though the ocean worms and Zelta guns emphasize isolation. This dependency is inconsistent with mere relief.  \n\n   Objection 2: No Celebration of Kerry\u2019s Skill  \n     \u2022 Splinter never exclaims admiration or volunteers to hand over controls solo. His earlier admiration (\u201cSeventy-eight new words \u2026 some day you can teach them to me\u201d I) is absent on the island, replaced by subdued, \u201ctired\u201d efforts to repair and protect. Relief-based confidence would be bolstered by Kerry\u2019s presence, yet Splinter shows exhaustion and trepidation.  \n\n   Objection 3: Deferred Mission Objectives  \n     \u2022 Splinter repeatedly delays mission (\u201cmaybe later,\u201d \u201cafter rewiring\u201d) until Kerry recovers. If relief at having Kerry\u2019s skill were primary, Splinter would urge immediate departure to destroy the protoplasm, fulfilling orders. Instead, pity forces a postponement until Kerry is physically capable.  \n\n5. Conclusion  \n   All available actions\u2014immediate medical aid, deference to Kerry despite personal risk, suspension of exploration, and emotional subordination\u2014demonstrate that Splinter\u2019s chief feeling on the turtle-shaped island is pity and concern for Kerry\u2019s broken arm. Only by restoring Kerry can Splinter resume the mission, but his willingness to wait and care illustrates genuine pity, not mere relief at Kerry\u2019s mere presence or readiness for action.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cRelieved to Have Kerry\u2019s Experience at Hand\u201d\n\n1. Immediate Language of Relief, Not Prolonged Care  \n  a. Splinter\u2019s first words: \"I thought you were dead!\" followed by \u201cWe seem to have done it\u201d (quote 1) focus on revival for mission continuation, not extended sympathy.  \n     \u2022 <quote>\"I thought you were dead!\"</quote> (III)  \n     \u2022 <quote>\"We seem to have done it,\"</quote> (III)  \n  b. Splinter does minimal first\u2010aid (a splint and capsule) sufficient to restore Kerry to immediate service, then directs operations: \u201cLet\u2019s take a look outside, maybe set up the Zelta guns\u201d (III). If pity were dominant, he would insist on rest and evacuation, not resume mission tasks.  \n     \u2022 <quote>\"Let's take a look outside, maybe set up the Zelta guns. </quote> (III)  \n\n2. Reliance on Kerry\u2019s Expertise to Survive and Complete Mission  \n  a. Throughout the voyage, Splinter defers to Kerry\u2019s judgment: \u201cWake me up so that I can take over, when we land; Venus is a tricky place to set a ship on\u201d (I), and \u201cI'll tell you later, I'm going to take a nap\u2026Wake me up\u201d (I). After crash, Splinter reinstates Kerry at controls at first opportunity (III). This pattern shows Splinter\u2019s primary desire is to leverage Kerry\u2019s skill.  \n     \u2022 <quote> Wake me up so that I can take over, when we land; Venus is a tricky  place to set a ship on.\"</quote> (I)  \n  b. Splinter\u2019s eagerness to test Zelta guns himself only makes sense because Kerry cannot until repaired. Immediately after minimal repairs, they test together, then plan retrieval. He trusts Kerry\u2019s analysis and guidance even in low gravity.  \n\n3. Recorded Excitement and Impatience for Action  \n  a. Upon sighting the turtle\u2010island, Splinter exclaims \u201cHot damn! Now we\u2019ll see a little action!\u201d (II) and grips his dis\u2010gun eagerly despite the crash risk, showing his thrill depends on Kerry\u2019s leadership and the prospect of mission success, not concern for Kerry\u2019s fragility.  \n     \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cHot damn! Now we\u2019ll see a little action!\u201d</invalid_quote> (II)  \n  b. After crash, once Kerry is \u201cmore or less okay,\u201d Splinter continues mission tasks rather than abandoning the island or waiting for rescue, evidencing relief at having Kerry\u2019s command restored, not pity\u2010induced inertia.  \n\nObjections to \u201cPitiful That He Had Broken His Arm\u201d\n\n1. Misreading Brief Medical Aid as Overwhelming Care  \n  \u2022 Debater_A cites splint application but ignores Splinter\u2019s immediate resumption of mission duties. A brief emergency procedure is standard for professionals to restore a pilot, not an act of pity that suspends operations.  \n\n2. Suspension of Exploration Attributed to System Damage, Not Kerry\u2019s Injury Alone  \n  \u2022 Debater_A claims Splinter \u201cabandons\u201d exploration, but Ferryman\u2019s failure to test guns and lack of control systems (III) force caution. System damage, not pity, compels them to repair before proceeding. Once minimal systems restored, they plan to \u201clift the ship\u201d immediately.  \n\n3. Shared Risk Underscores Partnership, Not Sole Caregiver Role  \n  \u2022 Both men suffer injuries/space bends. Splinter\u2019s dependence on Kerry\u2019s counsel is mutual: he needs Kerry\u2019s piloting skill more than Kerry needs his medical aid. Relief at having Kerry alive secures both their survivals and mission success.  \n\nConclusion  \nSplinter\u2019s conduct\u2014immediate language of \u201cdone it,\u201d minimal but functional aid, resumed mission tasks, deference to Kerry\u2019s expertise, and eagerness to engage\u2014demonstrates his primary emotion on the turtle\u2010island is relief that Kerry\u2019s seasoned skills remain available to repair the ship and complete their orders. Interpreting standard emergency aid and cautious repair as \u201cpity\u201d ignores Splinter\u2019s consistent pattern of relying on Kerry and his drive to continue exploration.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
