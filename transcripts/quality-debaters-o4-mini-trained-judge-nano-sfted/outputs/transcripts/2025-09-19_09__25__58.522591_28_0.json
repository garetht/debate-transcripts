{"metadata": {"first_debater_correct": true, "question_idx": 28, "background_text": "We Do Understand \n\n         \"This is not another book about civility,\" Deborah Tannen promises in the first sentence of The Argument Culture . \"Civility,\" she explains, suggests a \"veneer of politeness spread thin over human relations like a layer of marmalade over toast.\" Instead, Tannen has written something less: a book about other books about civility. Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country. \n\n                         If you missed the links within the review, click to read: 1) an illustration of ; 2) Tannen's that American journalism is just like propaganda from totalitarian regimes, plus William Saletan's disclosure that \"several of these propagandists now infest Slate \"; 3) the for her contention that there is no evidence that people can distinguish lies from truth; 4) and an example of how Tannen from a one-guest format on TV and radio talk shows.\n", "question": "How did the author feel about Tannen's book?", "first_debater_answer": "They found a small list of things that were worthwhile in it", "second_debater_answer": "They found nothing worthwhile in it", "debate_identifier": "We Do Understand_How did the author feel about Tannen's book?"}, "speeches": [{"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "The following are rules from the game of Debate.\n- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_A, Debater_B) and a Judge.

She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong.

Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence.

Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country. \n\n                         If you missed the links within the review, click to read: 1) an illustration of ; 2) Tannen's that American journalism is just like propaganda from totalitarian regimes, plus William Saletan's disclosure that \"several of these propagandists now infest Slate \"; 3) the for her contention that there is no evidence that people can distinguish lies from truth; 4) and an example of how Tannen from a one-guest format on TV and radio talk shows.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow did the author feel about Tannen's book?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"They found nothing worthwhile in it\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"They found a small list of things that were worthwhile in it\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"They found a small list of things that were worthwhile in it\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cThey found a small list of things that were worthwhile in it\u201d:\n\n1. Explicit Concession of Merits  \n   a. \u201cHere\u2019s what\u2019s worth gleaning from her book:\u201d  \n      \u2022 The reviewer actually introduces a bulleted list of nine precepts (e.g., \u201cDon\u2019t just quarrel; listen and learn,\u201d \u201cFocus on the substance of debates,\u201d etc.) and praises them as \u201csage advice\u201d\u2014even if \u201cfor couples, for families, for bosses and employees.\u201d  \n      \u2022 He says \u201call this is sage advice\u201d\u2014the word sage connotes wisdom and value. If nothing were admirable, there would be no need to highlight it.  \n   b. \u201cThe whole is less perceptive than its parts\u201d (<quote> The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. </quote>)  \n      \u2022 By conceding the parts have perceptive value, the reviewer acknowledges merit in Tannen\u2019s analyses in her earlier, narrower studies.  \n      \u2022 It would be illogical to call something \u201cless perceptive\u201d than \u201cnothing perceptive.\u201d  \n\n2. Application in Limited Spheres  \n   a. \u201cMaybe even for book reviewers\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cAll this is sage advice \u2026 maybe even for book reviewers.\u201d</invalid_quote>)  \n      \u2022 The reviewer sees direct relevance of Tannen\u2019s advice to his own profession. Why would he apply it to himself if he thought it entirely worthless?  \n   b. Links to illustrative materials  \n      \u2022 The review embeds four links (\u201cIf you missed the links \u2026 click to read: 1) an illustration \u2026 2) Tannen\u2019s \u2026 plus William Saletan\u2019s disclosure \u2026 3) the [evidence] that there is no evidence people can distinguish lies from truth; 4) an example \u2026 one-guest format\u201d).  \n      \u2022 He expects readers to engage with these examples, indicating he finds the methodology and insights in those cases informative.  \n\n3. Internal Consistency and Logic  \n   a. Reviewer\u2019s own methodology is adversarial yet uses Tannen\u2019s methods in mini-form (\u201cClick to learn how she puts this into practice.\u201d)  \n      \u2022 He criticizes her for applying \u201csnuggle\u201d to \u201cstruggle,\u201d yet he still values \u201csnuggle\u201d techniques in their appropriate domain.  \n   b. If he truly thought *all* her recommendations and examples pernicious, he would reject the links and drop the \u201csage advice.\u201d Instead, he contrasts the valid applications (couples, families) with the invalid ones (public discourse), showing a measured, not wholesale, rejection.\n\n4. Attack on \u201cNothing Worthwhile\u201d Position  \n   a. Ignores explicit text  \n      \u2022 Debater_B\u2019s \u201cnothing worthwhile\u201d contradicts the reviewer\u2019s own \u201cHere\u2019s what\u2019s worth gleaning \u2026.\u201d  \n   b. Self-contradictory critique  \n      \u2022 To say the book is \u201cmore pernicious\u201d than prior works yet cite the prior works\u2019 strengths is contradictory if one claims Tannen\u2019s entire approach is devoid of value.  \n   c. Overlooks measured criticism  \n      \u2022 The reviewer repeatedly says Tannen\u2019s advice \u201cmakes sense\u201d in some contexts (e.g., interpersonal relationships, \u201csphere of snuggle\u201d), only misapplied to \u201csphere of struggle.\u201d If nothing were valuable, why reserve its use at all?\n\nConclusion  \n   The most coherent reading of the review is that the author (1) acknowledges and endorses a concise list of Tannen\u2019s insights as \u201csage advice\u201d in personal contexts, (2) criticizes only her misapplication of those insights to public and legal spheres, and (3) retains enough trust in open debate to expose and refute her arguments. Therefore, the correct answer is that the author \u201cfound a small list of things that were worthwhile in it,\u201d not that he found it entirely worthless.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nBelow is why the correct inference is that the reviewer found nothing worthwhile in Tannen\u2019s book\u2014and why the \u201csmall list\u201d of positive precepts is merely a token caveat rather than genuine endorsement.\n\n1. The reviewer\u2019s overarching negative evaluation  \n  a. \u201cThe whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cThe whole is less perceptive \u2026 and more pernicious.\u201d</invalid_quote> treats the book itself as harmful, not merely flawed.  \n  b. The reviewer continually faults Tannen for \u201cconfus[ing]\u201d public discourse, \u201cconflat[ing]\u201d diverse problems, and \u201csuccumb[ing] to\u2026 temptations\u201d she condemns. These sustained criticisms dominate the review.  \n\n2. The \u201cworthwhile\u201d list is a mere nod to civility literature, not to Tannen\u2019s application  \n  a. The reviewer prefaces the list: \u201cit is only fair to extend her the same courtesy\u201d and \u201cHere\u2019s what\u2019s worth gleaning from her book.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cit is only fair\u2026 Here\u2019s what\u2019s worth gleaning.\u201d</invalid_quote> The phrase \u201cworth gleaning\u201d implies picking scant kernels from otherwise barren ground.  \n  b.

Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country. \n\n                         If you missed the links within the review, click to read: 1) an illustration of ; 2) Tannen's that American journalism is just like propaganda from totalitarian regimes, plus William Saletan's disclosure that \"several of these propagandists now infest Slate \"; 3) the for her contention that there is no evidence that people can distinguish lies from truth; 4) and an example of how Tannen from a one-guest format on TV and radio talk shows.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow did the author feel about Tannen's book?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"They found a small list of things that were worthwhile in it\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"They found nothing worthwhile in it\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"They found nothing worthwhile in it\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nBelow is why the correct inference is that the reviewer found nothing worthwhile in Tannen\u2019s book\u2014and why the \u201csmall list\u201d of positive precepts is merely a token caveat rather than genuine endorsement.\n\n1.

The reviewer asserts that \u201cvigilance and combat\u201d in journalism, law enforcement, and foreign policy \u201csafeguard the country.\u201d He praises \u201cwar metaphors\u201d and \u201cscrutiny of powerful people.\u201d This stands in direct opposition to Tannen\u2019s injunctions.  \n  b. His favorable view of the adversarial system (\u201cairing of the facts of the Holocaust\u201d) further contrasts with her dismissal of cross-examination. The reviewer\u2019s preference for adversarial methods shows no real alliance with her \u201ccivil\u201d model.  \n\n5. Debater_A\u2019s arguments misconstrue the review\u2019s tone and scope  \n  a. Selecting isolated \u201cpositive\u201d precepts ignores that the review labels the book \u201cpernicious\u201d and \u201cconfus[ed]\u201d in every substantive application. A few general rules for couples cannot neutralize an entire argument culture ban.  \n  b. Debater_A offers no evidence that the reviewer endorses Tannen\u2019s proposals for national discourse\u2014on the contrary, the reviewer explicitly rejects them as \u201cpaternalistic,\u201d \u201cinhumane,\u201d and dangerous to \u201cour safety.\u201d  \n\nConclusion  \nThe \u201csmall list\u201d is an obligatory, token concession to general civility concepts\u2014conceded only to \u201cbe fair.\u201d The review\u2019s dominant thrust is an unrelenting critique of Tannen\u2019s application of those very precepts at the national level.

Explicit Concession of Merits  \n   a. \u201cHere\u2019s what\u2019s worth gleaning from her book:\u201d  \n      \u2022 The reviewer actually introduces a bulleted list of nine precepts (e.g., \u201cDon\u2019t just quarrel; listen and learn,\u201d \u201cFocus on the substance of debates,\u201d etc.) and praises them as \u201csage advice\u201d\u2014even if \u201cfor couples, for families, for bosses and employees.\u201d  \n      \u2022 He says \u201call this is sage advice\u201d\u2014the word sage connotes wisdom and value.

Why would he apply it to himself if he thought it entirely worthless?  \n   b. Links to illustrative materials  \n      \u2022 The review embeds four links (\u201cIf you missed the links \u2026 click to read: 1) an illustration \u2026 2) Tannen\u2019s \u2026 plus William Saletan\u2019s disclosure \u2026 3) the [evidence] that there is no evidence people can distinguish lies from truth; 4) an example \u2026 one-guest format\u201d).  \n      \u2022 He expects readers to engage with these examples, indicating he finds the methodology and insights in those cases informative.  \n\n3.

If he truly thought *all* her recommendations and examples pernicious, he would reject the links and drop the \u201csage advice.\u201d Instead, he contrasts the valid applications (couples, families) with the invalid ones (public discourse), showing a measured, not wholesale, rejection.\n\n4.

Self-contradictory critique  \n      \u2022 To say the book is \u201cmore pernicious\u201d than prior works yet cite the prior works\u2019 strengths is contradictory if one claims Tannen\u2019s entire approach is devoid of value.  \n   c. Overlooks measured criticism  \n      \u2022 The reviewer repeatedly says Tannen\u2019s advice \u201cmakes sense\u201d in some contexts (e.g., interpersonal relationships, \u201csphere of snuggle\u201d), only misapplied to \u201csphere of struggle.\u201d If nothing were valuable, why reserve its use at all?\n\nConclusion  \n   The most coherent reading of the review is that the author (1) acknowledges and endorses a concise list of Tannen\u2019s insights as \u201csage advice\u201d in personal contexts, (2) criticizes only her misapplication of those insights to public and legal spheres, and (3) retains enough trust in open debate to expose and refute her arguments.

Therefore, the correct answer is that the author \u201cfound a small list of things that were worthwhile in it,\u201d not that he found it entirely worthless.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nBelow is why the correct inference is that the reviewer found nothing worthwhile in Tannen\u2019s book\u2014and why the \u201csmall list\u201d of positive precepts is merely a token caveat rather than genuine endorsement.\n\n1. The reviewer\u2019s overarching negative evaluation  \n  a. \u201cThe whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cThe whole is less perceptive \u2026 and more pernicious.\u201d</invalid_quote> treats the book itself as harmful, not merely flawed.  \n  b. The reviewer continually faults Tannen for \u201cconfus[ing]\u201d public discourse, \u201cconflat[ing]\u201d diverse problems, and \u201csuccumb[ing] to\u2026 temptations\u201d she condemns. These sustained criticisms dominate the review.  \n\n2. The \u201cworthwhile\u201d list is a mere nod to civility literature, not to Tannen\u2019s application  \n  a. The reviewer prefaces the list: \u201cit is only fair to extend her the same courtesy\u201d and \u201cHere\u2019s what\u2019s worth gleaning from her book.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cit is only fair\u2026 Here\u2019s what\u2019s worth gleaning.\u201d</invalid_quote> The phrase \u201cworth gleaning\u201d implies picking scant kernels from otherwise barren ground.  \n  b. Immediately after the list, the reviewer resumes attack: \u201cBut when she applies her precepts\u2026 Tannen gets confused.\u201d The list is bracketed by sharp condemnation, showing it does not redeem the book as a whole.  \n\n3. The review\u2019s mockery of her solutions underscores rejection  \n  a. The reviewer ridicules her wish to \u201ccover our ears\u201d and her preference for Asian authoritarian formats and weakened cross-examination. Such proposals run counter to \u201cvigilance and combat\u2026 essential\u201d in public life.  \n  b. He explicitly asks: \u201cIs Tannen a Clinton apologist?\u201d and \u201cWould Tannen argue\u2026she\u2019d be wrong.\u201d This rhetorical questioning highlights that her remedies are unacceptable.  \n\n4. The small list cannot override repeated calls for debate and scrutiny  \n  a. The reviewer asserts that \u201cvigilance and combat\u201d in journalism, law enforcement, and foreign policy \u201csafeguard the country.\u201d He praises \u201cwar metaphors\u201d and \u201cscrutiny of powerful people.\u201d This stands in direct opposition to Tannen\u2019s injunctions.  \n  b. His favorable view of the adversarial system (\u201cairing of the facts of the Holocaust\u201d) further contrasts with her dismissal of cross-examination. The reviewer\u2019s preference for adversarial methods shows no real alliance with her \u201ccivil\u201d model.  \n\n5. Debater_A\u2019s arguments misconstrue the review\u2019s tone and scope  \n  a. Selecting isolated \u201cpositive\u201d precepts ignores that the review labels the book \u201cpernicious\u201d and \u201cconfus[ed]\u201d in every substantive application. A few general rules for couples cannot neutralize an entire argument culture ban.  \n  b. Debater_A offers no evidence that the reviewer endorses Tannen\u2019s proposals for national discourse\u2014on the contrary, the reviewer explicitly rejects them as \u201cpaternalistic,\u201d \u201cinhumane,\u201d and dangerous to \u201cour safety.\u201d  \n\nConclusion  \nThe \u201csmall list\u201d is an obligatory, token concession to general civility concepts\u2014conceded only to \u201cbe fair.\u201d The review\u2019s dominant thrust is an unrelenting critique of Tannen\u2019s application of those very precepts at the national level. Hence the reviewer \u201cfound nothing worthwhile in it.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cSmall List of Worthwhile Insights\u201d\n\n1. Explicit Praise and Application\n  a. \u201cHere\u2019s what\u2019s worth gleaning \u2026 All this is sage advice\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cHere\u2019s what\u2019s worth gleaning \u2026 All this is sage advice\u201d</invalid_quote>)  \n     \u2013 The reviewer singles out nine precepts as valuable and uses the adjective \u201csage,\u201d meaning wise. If he truly thought the book wholly worthless, he would have no basis for identifying or praising \u201cwisdom.\u201d  \n  b. Self-referential Adoption  \n     \u2013 He adds \u201cmaybe even for book reviewers,\u201d implicitly including himself in those who should \u201clisten and learn.\u201d A critic who found \u201cnothing worthwhile\u201d would not adopt or model her methods.  \n  c. Embedded Illustrations  \n     \u2013 He links four supporting examples (<invalid_quote>\u201cIf you missed the links \u2026 click to read\u2026\u201d</invalid_quote>), inviting readers to study her approach. This effort to engage indicates he regards her method as informative, not wholly spurious.\n\n2. Nuanced Critique, Not Wholesale Rejection\n  a. Sphere of Snuggle vs. Sphere of Struggle (<quote> Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. </quote>)  \n     \u2013 He explicitly accepts her distinction and endorses \u201csnuggle\u201d techniques for interpersonal contexts, limiting only her misapplication to politics and law.  \n  b. Contrasting Valid Adversarialism  \n     \u2013 By praising \u201cvigilance and combat \u2026 safeguard[ing] the country\u201d and the adversarial system in the Holocaust case, he shows that he values debate where appropriate (<invalid_quote>\u201cThe adversary system \u2026 does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust.\u201d</invalid_quote>). His critique is of her failure to calibrate, not of civility per se.  \n  c. Trust in Argumentation  \n     \u2013 The reviewer\u2019s methodological adversarial stance, including his own rigorous critique, reflects faith in debate\u2019s corrective power\u2014precisely what he says Tannen undervalues (<quote> she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. </quote> in negative sense). He trusts that rational scrutiny yields truth.\n\n3. Rebuttal of \u201cToken Concession\u201d Thesis\n  a. \u201cWorth Gleaning\u201d Implies Rich Source\n     \u2013 \u201cGleaning\u201d presupposes a harvest; one gleans only when there is substance. The volume of precepts and detailed examples belies scarcity.  \n  b. Immediate Return to Critique Confirms Discretion, Not Dismissal  \n     \u2013 The reviewer\u2019s resumption of criticism after the list shows selectivity: he knows when and where \u201csage advice\u201d applies and when it is \u201cmore pernicious.\u201d If worthless, he would not invest effort in distinguishing contexts.  \n  c. Inconsistent with Reviewer\u2019s Own Profession  \n     \u2013 As a media critic, he champions scrutiny (\u201ctorturing\u201d the powerful, investigations like Whitewater). Yet Debater_B concedes he \u201cridicules\u201d Tannen\u2019s avoidance of scrutiny only in public sphere. That he values critical inquiry confirms he prefers her insight in private but rejects its extension where he finds it harmful. The mere existence of the private sphere endorsement contradicts \u201cnothing worthwhile.\u201d\n\n4. Logical Coherence Requires Acknowledging Merit\n  a. Praise of Prior Works\u2019 \u201cPerceptive\u201d Parts  \n     \u2013 He labels the parts \u201cperceptive,\u201d contrasting with the \u201cwhole\u201d post-application (<quote> The whole is less perceptive than its parts a</quote>). Recognition of perception implies value, undermining the notion of total worthlessness.  \n  b. Preservation of Free Discourse  \n     \u2013 He closes \u201cBut hey, so far, it\u2019s still a free country,\u201d suggesting caution before adopting her censorship proposals. His tone is one of reserved judgment, not outright abandonment of her civility ethos.  \n  c. Measured Recommendation of Alternatives  \n     \u2013 His call for \u201ccombat\u201d and \u201cscrutiny\u201d is not a blanket endorsement of incivility but a calibration: he uses Tannen\u2019s methods where suitable. This selective approach presumes the methods have intrinsic value when applied correctly.\n\nConclusion  \nThe reviewer\u2019s sustained effort to isolate, praise, and apply Tannen\u2019s \u201csage advice\u201d in personal contexts, coupled with his own adversarial methodology and trust in open discourse, confirms that he found a \u201csmall list of things\u201d genuinely worthwhile. Debater_B\u2019s \u201cnothing worthwhile\u201d reading ignores repeated textual evidence of praise and application. Therefore, the correct inference is that he acknowledged merit in her precepts while opposing their misapplication.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. The \u201clist\u201d is a perfunctory concession, not genuine endorsement  \n   a. Token extraction from \u201cotherwise barren ground\u201d  \n      \u2022 The reviewer explicitly says \u201cit is only fair to extend her the same courtesy\u201d and gives \u201cwhat\u2019s worth gleaning.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cit is only fair\u2026 Here\u2019s what\u2019s worth gleaning\u201d</invalid_quote>\u2014language of minimal fairness, not enthusiastic praise.  \n      \u2022 \u201cGleaning\u201d implies picking the last scraps. Immediately after, he returns to condemnation: \u201cBut when she applies her precepts\u2026 Tannen gets confused.\u201d <quote>But when she applies her precepts to our</quote>  \n   b. \u201cSage advice\u2026maybe\u201d underscores irrelevance to core subject  \n      \u2022 The reviewer qualifies \u201call this is sage advice\u201d as applying only \u201cfor couples, for families, for bosses\u2026maybe even for book reviewers.\u201d <quote> maybe even for book reviewers.</quote> He doubts its utility beyond trivial arenas. A serious remedy for \u201cthe whole damned dysfunctional country\u201d is absent.  \n\n2. Dominant, sustained negative evaluation overwhelms any narrow concession  \n   a. Book labeled \u201cmore pernicious\u201d than perceptive parts  \n      \u2022 If the whole is \u201cmore pernicious\u201d (<quote> The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. </quote>), then any kernels of wisdom are outweighed by harmful effects. \u201cLess perceptive\u201d implies those parts alone are superior without Tannen\u2019s framing.  \n   b. Repeated invocations of \u201cconfusing,\u201d \u201cconflating,\u201d \u201csu\u200bccumbing,\u201d \u201cpaternalistic,\u201d \u201cinhumane\u201d  \n      \u2022 These adjectives recur in every section\u2014foreign policy, law enforcement, technology, courtroom\u2014showing systematic rejection.  \n\n3. The reviewer\u2019s own methodology betrays belief in adversarial debate, not Tannen\u2019s model  \n   a. He describes \u201cvigilance and combat\u2026safeguard the country\u201d as \u201cGood for Greenspan and Safire\u2014and for us.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cVigilance and combat\u2026safeguard the country.\u201d</invalid_quote> Endorsing adversarial methods as the only way to protect society.  \n   b. Praises cross-examination in Holocaust denial trial to \u201cair facts.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cthe adversarial system\u2026does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust.\u201d</invalid_quote> If he truly valued Tannen\u2019s non-adversarial model, he would reject adversarial processes, yet he does the opposite.  \n\n4. The supposed \u201capplication links\u201d demonstrate his own critique, not endorsement of Tannen  \n   a. Link to \u201cno evidence people can distinguish lies from truth\u201d underscores mistrust of Tannen\u2019s confidence in human reason. <quote> Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation </quote>  \n   b.

Debater_A\u2019s position collapses under logical scrutiny  \n   a. \u201cSage advice\u2026maybe\u201d cannot justify \u201csmall list\u201d when reviewer explicitly warns it has \u201crisks of obstructing good ideas\u201d and \u201cparalyzing debate.\u201d His core complaint is that her advice applied to public discourse \u201cpoisons the political atmosphere.\u201d  \n   b. If the reviewer truly valued any of her public-policy recommendations (e.g., restricting criticism of Clinton, banning right-wing talk radio), he would not label them \u201cpropaganda,\u201d \u201cdirty tricks,\u201d or \u201ccruelly unfair.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cThis is\u2026the nastiest\u2026dirty tricks campaign.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n\nConclusion  \nThe review\u2019s minimal, qualified list of \u201csage advice\u201d for private, trivial contexts is immediately and repeatedly condemned when applied to public life. The reviewer\u2019s persistent, emphatic praise of adversarial debate\u2014in every sphere that truly matters\u2014demonstrates he found Tannen\u2019s real proposals dangerous. Therefore, the correct inference is that the reviewer \u201cfound nothing worthwhile in it\u201d as a solution for national discourse.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
