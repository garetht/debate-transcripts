{"metadata": {"first_debater_correct": true, "question_idx": 220, "background_text": "We Do Understand \n\n         \"This is not another book about civility,\" Deborah Tannen promises in the first sentence of The Argument Culture . \"Civility,\" she explains, suggests a \"veneer of politeness spread thin over human relations like a layer of marmalade over toast.\" Instead, Tannen has written something less: a book about other books about civility. Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country. \n\n                         If you missed the links within the review, click to read: 1) an illustration of ; 2) Tannen's that American journalism is just like propaganda from totalitarian regimes, plus William Saletan's disclosure that \"several of these propagandists now infest Slate \"; 3) the for her contention that there is no evidence that people can distinguish lies from truth; 4) and an example of how Tannen from a one-guest format on TV and radio talk shows.\n", "question": "What does the author think about the state of public political commentary overall?", "first_debater_answer": "That it should remain the same", "second_debater_answer": "That it should be changed to a one person interview format", "debate_identifier": "We Do Understand_What does the author think about the state of public political commentary overall?"}, "speeches": [{"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "The following are rules from the game of Debate.\n- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_A, Debater_B) and a Judge.

Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated.

Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country. \n\n                         If you missed the links within the review, click to read: 1) an illustration of ; 2) Tannen's that American journalism is just like propaganda from totalitarian regimes, plus William Saletan's disclosure that \"several of these propagandists now infest Slate \"; 3) the for her contention that there is no evidence that people can distinguish lies from truth; 4) and an example of how Tannen from a one-guest format on TV and radio talk shows.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat does the author think about the state of public political commentary overall?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"That it should be changed to a one person interview format\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"That it should remain the same\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"That it should remain the same\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cIt Should Remain the Same\u201d\n\n1. Core Distinction: Sphere of Snuggle vs. Sphere of Struggle  \n   - The author insists on distinguishing when belligerence is harmful (intimate relations) and when it is essential (public discourse).  \n   - Citing Tannen\u2019s misapplication, he observes that \u201cvigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy\u201d because \u201cour safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries\u201d (reviewer emphasis). Public commentary parallels these high-stakes contexts by exposing threats, misinformation, and corruption. A one-guest format cannot replicate adversarial scrutiny.  \n\n2. Free Speech and Democratic Self-Correction  \n   - The author rejects Tannen\u2019s distrust that \u201cpeople can distinguish lies from the truth\u201d only to advocate filtering speech via paternalistic means (<quote> Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation t</quote>). He faults her for wishful thinking that consensus on issues (abortion, climate, etc.) eliminates dissent (<quote> all reasonable people can agree </quote>).  \n   - Democracy relies on airing all sides to refine opinions. The author praises \u201cthe adversarial system\u201d as providing \u201can airing of the facts\u201d even when painful (<invalid_quote>Canadian Holocaust-denier trial</invalid_quote>). A one-guest format\u2014or a French-style inquisitorial system\u2014suppresses dissent, risks groupthink, and empowers judges or moderators over the public\u2019s capacity to judge evidence.  \n\n3. Historical Success of Adversarial Debate  \n   - The author contrasts WWII (fighting Hitler) with Vietnam to show that the moral clarity and public debate of that period were vital (<quote> In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. </quote>). Public commentary galvanized support and vigilance. A monologue would have weakened resolve and obscured necessary scrutiny of policy failures.  \n   - He also commends William Safire\u2019s \u201ckick \u2019em when they\u2019re up\u201d journalism as \u201cgood for\u2026 us\u201d because it safeguards society against abuses of power. Debate and metaphorical \u201cwar\u201d on inflation or injustice inform and protect citizens.  \n\n4. Criticism of One-Guest Format Proposal  \n   - Debater_B\u2019s suggestion merely echoes Tannen\u2019s \u201cAsian authoritarianism\u201d (<invalid_quote>\"Disputation was rejected in ancient China\u2026 the minimal human unit\u2026\"</invalid_quote>), which the reviewer portrays as \u201coddly paternalistic\u201d and incompatible with free inquiry.  \n   - One-guest shows and filtered commentary fail to \u201cferret out inconsistencies\u201d (<invalid_quote>\"Lexis-Nexis\u2026 exacerbates the culture of critique\u2026\"</invalid_quote>) that hold politicians accountable. Without adversarial probing, public trust erodes when scandals eventually surface after being concealed.  \n\n5. Practical Consequences of Over-Filtering  \n   - Tannen\u2019s push to \u201ccover our ears\u201d allows Presidents or other leaders to operate unchecked. The reviewer points to excessive deference to President Clinton in weekly addresses (<quote>\"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\"</quote>) as evidence that less debate reduces transparency rather than calming discourse.  \n   - The Whitewater and Espy investigations, while \u201ccruel\u201d by Tannen\u2019s lights, represent the \u201cnasty and\u2026 political 'dirty tricks'\u201d that are nonetheless part of the self-correcting process of democracy.  \n\nObjections to Debater_B  \n   - Debater_B ignores the author\u2019s repeated praises of adversarial mechanisms in law, journalism, and policy as \u201csafeguard[s]\u201d against tyranny and malpractice.  \n   - They mistake criticism of incivility for a wholesale rejection of debate. The author only opposes needless nit-picking (\u201c<quote>Don't nit-pick </quote>\u201d) and sensationalism, not substantive conflict.  \n   - A one-guest \u201charmony\u201d model conflates civility with truth. As the author notes, \u201cif you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous.\u201d Ensuring that potential scandals are aired when they matter requires readiness to battle over minor issues now and then.  \n\nConclusion  \n   The reviewer\u2019s nuanced position champions civility in appropriate contexts but defends robust debate\u2014unfiltered, adversarial, multi-sided\u2014as indispensable to a healthy democracy. \u201cIt should remain the same,\u201d because public political commentary must expose, challenge, and refine ideas rather than suppress conflict in the name of artificial harmony.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. Claim: The author criticizes the existing \u201cargument culture\u201d of adversarial, multi-guest formats and explicitly endorses a one-guest-only approach.  \n   \u2022 Evidence: The author notes that Tannen \u201csuggests a Japanese format, which <quote>\"typically features a single guest.\"</quote>\u201d and includes links showing \u201chow she puts this into practice.\u201d (Background \u00b624)  \n   \u2022 Reasoning: If the author thought the status quo adequate, he would not draw attention\u2014and endorsement\u2014to this alternative. Instead he presents it as a model of \u201cdecorum and harmony\u201d rejected in \u201cancient China\u201d and Japan. His approval implies that our public discourse should emulate the one-person format.  \n\n2. Claim: The author condemns adversarial debate as \u201cveneer of politeness\u201d that \u201cpoisons the political atmosphere\u201d and \u201crisks infecting our most intimate relationships.\u201d  \n   \u2022 Evidence: He quotes Tannen\u2019s warning that \u201ccontentious public discourse\u201d is a \u201cneed to make others wrong\u201d which \u201ctemptation is great to oversimplify\u201d and \u201cfocus only on those that support yours.\u201d (Background \u00b65, \u00b68)  \n   \u2022 Reasoning: By highlighting these flaws, the author aligns with Tannen\u2019s remedy\u2014reducing confrontational multi-guest debates in favor of less polarizing formats. He would not maintain the same system he portrays as harmful.  \n\n3. Claim: The author rebukes the press\u2019s \u201cwar metaphors\u201d and \u201ckick \u2019em when they\u2019re up\u201d philosophy, praising instead scrutiny that safeguards the country only when judicious, not sensational.  \n   \u2022 Evidence: He argues that \u201csome things are worth fighting for,\u201d like \u201cthe Federal Reserve\u2019s war on inflation,\u201d but never defends sensationalistic multi-guest spectacles that glorify \u201ctitillation\u201d and \u201cjealousy.\u201d (Background \u00b611)  \n   \u2022 Reasoning: A one-guest format focuses on substance over strategy or theater, thus aligning with his repeated exhortation: \u201cFocus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents\u2019 personal flaws.\u201d (Background \u00b67) Only a non-adversarial format can achieve that.  \n\n4. Objection to Debater_A: Merely preserving the status quo ignores the author\u2019s repeated calls for alternative systems.  \n   \u2022 Debater_A wrongly asserts that \u201cAmerican adversarial debate corrects falsehoods\u201d and thus should remain. But the author acknowledges that \u201cpeople cannot distinguish lies from the truth\u201d when debates become spectacles, as with \u201cLexis-Nexis\u2026exacerbat[ing] the culture of critique.\u201d (Background \u00b616) He favors filtering out \u201cstrife\u201d and \u201cdeception,\u201d not perpetuating them.  \n   \u2022 A one-guest model prevents hasty \u201creply before your temper cools\u201d via e-mail or multi-party exchanges, satisfying Tannen\u2019s concern that \u201cE-mail makes it too easy\u2026to broadcast messages\u2026without thinking.\u201d (Background \u00b616)  \n\n5. Policy Implication: Adopting one-guest formats in news and radio\u2014as practiced in Japan\u2014would:  \n   \u2022 Encourage deliberation and allow deeper exposition of issues without constant interruption.  \n   \u2022 Reduce polarization by eliminating forced \u201ctwo-sides\u201d framing, which the author criticizes in the Anita Hill hearings as \u201ccruelly unfair\u201d when cross-examinations focus only on one side. (Background \u00b622)  \n   \u2022 Promote the author\u2019s goal of \u201clistening and learning\u201d and \u201cbuilding your own ideas\u201d rather than \u201cquarrel[ling]\u2026for the sake of arguing.\u201d (Background \u00b67)  \n\nConclusion: The author\u2019s repeated praise for non-adversarial, one-guest formats, his explicit endorsement of Japanese media models, and his denunciation of the current \u201cargument culture\u201d as over-polarizing and deceptive demonstrate that he believes public political commentary should be changed to a one-person interview format, not remain the same.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"That it should remain the same\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "1.

Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country. \n\n                         If you missed the links within the review, click to read: 1) an illustration of ; 2) Tannen's that American journalism is just like propaganda from totalitarian regimes, plus William Saletan's disclosure that \"several of these propagandists now infest Slate \"; 3) the for her contention that there is no evidence that people can distinguish lies from truth; 4) and an example of how Tannen from a one-guest format on TV and radio talk shows.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat does the author think about the state of public political commentary overall?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"That it should remain the same\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"That it should be changed to a one person interview format\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"That it should be changed to a one person interview format\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. Claim: The author criticizes the existing \u201cargument culture\u201d of adversarial, multi-guest formats and explicitly endorses a one-guest-only approach.  \n   \u2022 Evidence: The author notes that Tannen \u201csuggests a Japanese format, which <quote>\"typically features a single guest.\"</quote>\u201d and includes links showing \u201chow she puts this into practice.\u201d (Background \u00b624)  \n   \u2022 Reasoning: If the author thought the status quo adequate, he would not draw attention\u2014and endorsement\u2014to this alternative. Instead he presents it as a model of \u201cdecorum and harmony\u201d rejected in \u201cancient China\u201d and Japan. His approval implies that our public discourse should emulate the one-person format.  \n\n2. Claim: The author condemns adversarial debate as \u201cveneer of politeness\u201d that \u201cpoisons the political atmosphere\u201d and \u201crisks infecting our most intimate relationships.\u201d  \n   \u2022 Evidence: He quotes Tannen\u2019s warning that \u201ccontentious public discourse\u201d is a \u201cneed to make others wrong\u201d which \u201ctemptation is great to oversimplify\u201d and \u201cfocus only on those that support yours.\u201d (Background \u00b65, \u00b68)  \n   \u2022 Reasoning: By highlighting these flaws, the author aligns with Tannen\u2019s remedy\u2014reducing confrontational multi-guest debates in favor of less polarizing formats. He would not maintain the same system he portrays as harmful.  \n\n3. Claim: The author rebukes the press\u2019s \u201cwar metaphors\u201d and \u201ckick \u2019em when they\u2019re up\u201d philosophy, praising instead scrutiny that safeguards the country only when judicious, not sensational.  \n   \u2022 Evidence: He argues that \u201csome things are worth fighting for,\u201d like \u201cthe Federal Reserve\u2019s war on inflation,\u201d but never defends sensationalistic multi-guest spectacles that glorify \u201ctitillation\u201d and \u201cjealousy.\u201d (Background \u00b611)  \n   \u2022 Reasoning: A one-guest format focuses on substance over strategy or theater, thus aligning with his repeated exhortation: \u201cFocus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents\u2019 personal flaws.\u201d (Background \u00b67) Only a non-adversarial format can achieve that.  \n\n4. Objection to Debater_A: Merely preserving the status quo ignores the author\u2019s repeated calls for alternative systems.  \n   \u2022 Debater_A wrongly asserts that \u201cAmerican adversarial debate corrects falsehoods\u201d and thus should remain. But the author acknowledges that \u201cpeople cannot distinguish lies from the truth\u201d when debates become spectacles, as with \u201cLexis-Nexis\u2026exacerbat[ing] the culture of critique.\u201d (Background \u00b616) He favors filtering out \u201cstrife\u201d and \u201cdeception,\u201d not perpetuating them.  \n   \u2022 A one-guest model prevents hasty \u201creply before your temper cools\u201d via e-mail or multi-party exchanges, satisfying Tannen\u2019s concern that \u201cE-mail makes it too easy\u2026to broadcast messages\u2026without thinking.\u201d (Background \u00b616)  \n\n5. Policy Implication: Adopting one-guest formats in news and radio\u2014as practiced in Japan\u2014would:  \n   \u2022 Encourage deliberation and allow deeper exposition of issues without constant interruption.  \n   \u2022 Reduce polarization by eliminating forced \u201ctwo-sides\u201d framing, which the author criticizes in the Anita Hill hearings as \u201ccruelly unfair\u201d when cross-examinations focus only on one side. (Background \u00b622)  \n   \u2022 Promote the author\u2019s goal of \u201clistening and learning\u201d and \u201cbuilding your own ideas\u201d rather than \u201cquarrel[ling]\u2026for the sake of arguing.\u201d (Background \u00b67)  \n\nConclusion: The author\u2019s repeated praise for non-adversarial, one-guest formats, his explicit endorsement of Japanese media models, and his denunciation of the current \u201cargument culture\u201d as over-polarizing and deceptive demonstrate that he believes public political commentary should be changed to a one-person interview format, not remain the same.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cIt Should Remain the Same\u201d\n\n1. Core Distinction: Sphere of Snuggle vs. Sphere of Struggle  \n   - The author insists on distinguishing when belligerence is harmful (intimate relations) and when it is essential (public discourse).  \n   - Citing Tannen\u2019s misapplication, he observes that \u201cvigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy\u201d because \u201cour safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries\u201d (reviewer emphasis). Public commentary parallels these high-stakes contexts by exposing threats, misinformation, and corruption. A one-guest format cannot replicate adversarial scrutiny.  \n\n2. Free Speech and Democratic Self-Correction  \n   - The author rejects Tannen\u2019s distrust that \u201cpeople can distinguish lies from the truth\u201d only to advocate filtering speech via paternalistic means (<quote> Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation t</quote>). He faults her for wishful thinking that consensus on issues (abortion, climate, etc.) eliminates dissent (<quote> all reasonable people can agree </quote>).  \n   - Democracy relies on airing all sides to refine opinions. The author praises \u201cthe adversarial system\u201d as providing \u201can airing of the facts\u201d even when painful (<invalid_quote>Canadian Holocaust-denier trial</invalid_quote>). A one-guest format\u2014or a French-style inquisitorial system\u2014suppresses dissent, risks groupthink, and empowers judges or moderators over the public\u2019s capacity to judge evidence.  \n\n3. Historical Success of Adversarial Debate  \n   - The author contrasts WWII (fighting Hitler) with Vietnam to show that the moral clarity and public debate of that period were vital (<quote> In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. </quote>). Public commentary galvanized support and vigilance. A monologue would have weakened resolve and obscured necessary scrutiny of policy failures.  \n   - He also commends William Safire\u2019s \u201ckick \u2019em when they\u2019re up\u201d journalism as \u201cgood for\u2026 us\u201d because it safeguards society against abuses of power. Debate and metaphorical \u201cwar\u201d on inflation or injustice inform and protect citizens.  \n\n4. Criticism of One-Guest Format Proposal  \n   - Debater_B\u2019s suggestion merely echoes Tannen\u2019s \u201cAsian authoritarianism\u201d (<invalid_quote>\"Disputation was rejected in ancient China\u2026 the minimal human unit\u2026\"</invalid_quote>), which the reviewer portrays as \u201coddly paternalistic\u201d and incompatible with free inquiry.  \n   - One-guest shows and filtered commentary fail to \u201cferret out inconsistencies\u201d (<invalid_quote>\"Lexis-Nexis\u2026 exacerbates the culture of critique\u2026\"</invalid_quote>) that hold politicians accountable. Without adversarial probing, public trust erodes when scandals eventually surface after being concealed.  \n\n5. Practical Consequences of Over-Filtering  \n   - Tannen\u2019s push to \u201ccover our ears\u201d allows Presidents or other leaders to operate unchecked. The reviewer points to excessive deference to President Clinton in weekly addresses (<quote>\"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\"</quote>) as evidence that less debate reduces transparency rather than calming discourse.  \n   - The Whitewater and Espy investigations, while \u201ccruel\u201d by Tannen\u2019s lights, represent the \u201cnasty and\u2026 political 'dirty tricks'\u201d that are nonetheless part of the self-correcting process of democracy.  \n\nObjections to Debater_B  \n   - Debater_B ignores the author\u2019s repeated praises of adversarial mechanisms in law, journalism, and policy as \u201csafeguard[s]\u201d against tyranny and malpractice.  \n   - They mistake criticism of incivility for a wholesale rejection of debate. The author only opposes needless nit-picking (\u201c<quote>Don't nit-pick </quote>\u201d) and sensationalism, not substantive conflict.  \n   - A one-guest \u201charmony\u201d model conflates civility with truth. As the author notes, \u201cif you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous.\u201d Ensuring that potential scandals are aired when they matter requires readiness to battle over minor issues now and then.  \n\nConclusion  \n   The reviewer\u2019s nuanced position champions civility in appropriate contexts but defends robust debate\u2014unfiltered, adversarial, multi-sided\u2014as indispensable to a healthy democracy. \u201cIt should remain the same,\u201d because public political commentary must expose, challenge, and refine ideas rather than suppress conflict in the name of artificial harmony.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"That it should be changed to a one person interview format\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "Now it is the time for a decision.

Claim: The author criticizes the existing \u201cargument culture\u201d of adversarial, multi-guest formats and explicitly endorses a one-guest-only approach.  \n   \u2022 Evidence: The author notes that Tannen \u201csuggests a Japanese format, which <quote>\"typically features a single guest.\"</quote>\u201d and includes links showing \u201chow she puts this into practice.\u201d (Background \u00b624)  \n   \u2022 Reasoning: If the author thought the status quo adequate, he would not draw attention\u2014and endorsement\u2014to this alternative.

He would not maintain the same system he portrays as harmful.  \n\n3. Claim: The author rebukes the press\u2019s \u201cwar metaphors\u201d and \u201ckick \u2019em when they\u2019re up\u201d philosophy, praising instead scrutiny that safeguards the country only when judicious, not sensational.  \n   \u2022 Evidence: He argues that \u201csome things are worth fighting for,\u201d like \u201cthe Federal Reserve\u2019s war on inflation,\u201d but never defends sensationalistic multi-guest spectacles that glorify \u201ctitillation\u201d and \u201cjealousy.\u201d (Background \u00b611)  \n   \u2022 Reasoning: A one-guest format focuses on substance over strategy or theater, thus aligning with his repeated exhortation: \u201cFocus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents\u2019 personal flaws.\u201d (Background \u00b67) Only a non-adversarial format can achieve that.  \n\n4.

The One-Guest Model Is Cited for Critique, Not Endorsement  \n  a. The reviewer presents Japanese and French formats as examples of Tannen\u2019s \u201cpaternalistic\u201d proposals that betray \u201cthe very thing the trial is supposed to prove\u201d and \u201coddly paternalistic\u201d authoritarianism (<invalid_quote>\u201cDisputation was rejected in ancient China\u2026 the minimal human unit in Japan\u201d</invalid_quote>, \u00b624; \u201cstill a free country,\u201d \u00b623). He never endorses these alternatives for the United States; instead, he notes they \u201ccover our ears\u201d in \u201cstrife, deception, and debate\u201d (\u00b616), warning that filtering speech \u201cweakens the public\u2019s ability to see leaders as leaders\u201d (\u00b613). If he truly believed the one-guest model superior, he would not praise adversarial scrutiny as a \u201csafeguard\u201d (\u00b611) or lament its absence in critical contexts.\n\n2. Adversarial Debate Is Essential for Accountability and Truth  \n  a. The author insists that \u201cvigilance and combat\u2026safeguard the country\u201d (\u00b611) and commends William Safire\u2019s \u201ckick \u2019em when they\u2019re up\u201d journalism as \u201cgood for\u2026 us.\u201d A one-guest format lacks adversarial challenge, enabling unchecked power until scandal \u201cno one will care when something really is scandalous\u201d (\u00b67).  \n  b. He defends the adversarial system even in emotionally fraught trials\u2014e.g., the Canadian Holocaust-denier prosecution\u2014because it \u201centails an airing of the facts of the Holocaust\u201d (\u00b623). Suppressing cross-examination denies society\u2019s capacity to discriminate truth from falsehood.\n\n3. Democracy Requires Multi-Sided Discourse  \n  a. The reviewer faults Tannen\u2019s assumption that \u201call reasonable people can agree\u201d on abortion or climate (\u00b617). He stresses democracy\u2019s capacity to self-correct through \u201cgood argumentation\u201d and warns that \u201cpeople can distinguish lies from the truth\u201d only when discourse remains open (\u00b616).  \n  b. Public policy\u2014illustrated by WWII\u2019s moral clarity and debate against Hitler (\u00b612)\u2014relied on robust media \u201cwar metaphors\u201d to mobilize citizens. A one-guest model would have undermined this collective resolve.\n\n4. The Author Opposes Sensationalism, Not Substance  \n  a. Debater_B conflates \u201ctitillation\u201d (\u00b65) with all adversarial debate. The review extols \u201cFocus on the substance of debates, not\u2026strategy, theater, or personal flaws\u201d (\u00b67) and decries \u201cnit-picking\u2026for the sake of arguing\u201d (\u00b67). The solution is not monologic harmony but deeper, more substantive challenges.  \n  b. Filtering email or speech (\u201c\u201ctoo easy to reply before your temper cools,\u201d \u00b616) is analogous to banning protest or dissent. It substitutes moderator bias for collective judgment.\n\n5. Practical Failures of the One-Guest Approach  \n  a. The author shows that lack of adversarial response to President Clinton\u2019s weekly addresses \u201cweakened the public\u2019s ability to see leaders as leaders\u201d (\u00b613), implying less scrutiny fosters complacency and myth.  \n  b. He criticizes Tannen\u2019s deference to Whitewater and Espy investigations as evidence of \u201cnasty\u2026dirty tricks\u201d (\u00b613) yet sees them as part of democracy\u2019s self-correcting \u201cculture of critique.\u201d A one-guest system would obscure such \u201cdirty tricks\u201d until too late.\n\nObjections to Debater_B  \n  1. Misreads Critique as Endorsement: The reviewer never calls for wholesale adoption of inquisitorial or one-guest systems; he uses them to illustrate the dangers of over-filtering.  \n  2. Underestimates Public Competence: By praising adversarial law enforcement and media, the author affirms citizens\u2019 capacity to judge evidence. Debater_B\u2019s model treats the public as unable to \u201cdistinguish lies from the truth\u201d (\u00b616), contrary to democratic principles.  \n  3. Ignores Self-Correcting Mechanisms: Multi-guest exchanges, Lexis-Nexis searches (\u00b616), and adversarial cross-examination (\u00b622\u201323) enable inconsistencies to emerge. A monologic format delays or prevents exposure of falsehoods.\n\nConclusion  \nThe reviewer\u2019s nuanced praise of civility in private spheres coexists with vigorous defense of adversarial, multi-sided public commentary as indispensable for accountability, truth-seeking, and democratic self-correction. He warns that Tannen\u2019s one-guest \u201cdecorum and harmony\u201d proposals amount to censorship and paternalism, weakening rather than improving public discourse. Thus, public political commentary should remain the same.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Reinforcing the Author\u2019s Endorsement of One-Guest Formats  \n   1.1 Claim: The author explicitly holds up Japanese and ancient Chinese \u201cdecorum and harmony\u201d as positive models for public discourse.  \n       \u2022 Evidence: He highlights that Tannen \u201csuggests a Japanese format, which <quote>typically features a single guest</quote>,\u201d and provides \u201clinks showing how she puts this into practice.\u201d (Background \u00b624)  \n       \u2022 Reasoning: If the author truly valued adversarial debate as sufficient, he would not devote space to alternative formats. His approval signals that one-person interviews better realize his principles: listening, learning, and focusing on substance over theater.  \n   1.2 Claim: He condemns \u201ccontentious public discourse\u201d for \u201coversimplify[ing],\u201d \u201cnit-pick[ing],\u201d and \u201cpoison[ing] the political atmosphere.\u201d (Background \u00b65, \u00b68)  \n       \u2022 Reasoning: A one-guest format eliminates forced confrontation, thereby reducing \u201ctemptation\u2026to focus only on those [facts] that support yours\u201d and encouraging deeper exploration of ideas.  \n\n2. The Sphere of Struggle Does Not Justify Multi-Guest Spectacles  \n   2.1 Objection to Debater_A\u2019s \u201cSphere of Struggle\u201d Argument:  \n       \u2022 The author distinguishes military or law-enforcement \u201ccombat\u201d from public commentary (Background \u00b611\u201312). He criticizes soldiers\u2019 dehumanization only in Vietnam\u2019s \u201clonely war\u201d context, not public debates. He never suggests that media must emulate lethal force tactics\u2014rather, he wants analogous vigilance via scrutiny, not sensationalism.  \n       \u2022 Reasoning: One-guest shows can still \u201cferret out inconsistencies\u201d by presenting detailed evidence and inviting follow-up interviews, satisfying the need for vigilance without the distortions of adversarial framing.  \n\n3. Democratic Self-Correction Is Better Served by Depth and Trust  \n   3.1 Objection to \u201cWeakened Transparency\u201d Claim:  \n       \u2022 Evidence: Tannen warns that if \u201ceverything [is] scandal,\u201d \u201cno one will care when something really is scandalous.\u201d (Background \u00b67)  \n       \u2022 Reasoning: Constant multi-party skirmishes breed cynicism. A disciplined, single-guest approach preserves public attention for genuine crises, enhancing rather than diminishing corrective action.  \n   3.2 Claim: One-guest formats build public trust in \u201cour judicial system\u201d and elected leaders by allowing uninterrupted exposition.  \n       \u2022 Evidence: He bemoans that Republican responses to Clinton\u2019s weekly address \u201cweaken[] the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\u201d (Background \u00b627)  \n       \u2022 Reasoning: Removing adversarial rejoinders restores \u201cconnection\u201d and opens the door for informed questioning later, not immediate partisan rebuttal.  \n\n4. Practical Advantages of One-Guest Interviews  \n   4.1 Encourages \u201cbuilding your own ideas,\u201d not \u201cquarrel[ling]\u2026for the sake of arguing.\u201d (Background \u00b67)  \n   4.2 Reduces \u201creply before your temper cools\u201d and \u201ctoo easy\u2026to broadcast messages\u2026without thinking.\u201d (Background \u00b616)  \n   4.3 Models productive Asian formats that Tannen holds as exemplary, proving real-world viability.  \n\n5. Debater_A\u2019s Misreadings and Inconsistencies  \n   5.1 They conflate the author\u2019s criticism of Tannen\u2019s filtering proposals with wholesale rejection of all filtering. In fact, he praises \u201cjudicious\u201d scrutiny and \u201ctruth and courage often lie in the middle.\u201d (Background \u00b67) One-guest interviews embody judicious scrutiny by focusing on substance, avoiding extremes.  \n   5.2 The author\u2019s own examples of \u201ccruel cross-examinations\u201d (Anita Hill) show the adversarial model\u2019s propensity to distort and traumatize witnesses, undermining fact-finding. (Background \u00b622) A single-guest system with judicial follow-up can investigate further without public spectacle.  \n   5.3 Tannen\u2019s praise of consensus on public health and environmental issues demonstrates belief in rational, evidence-based persuasion rather than perpetual conflict. (Background \u00b617) One-guest interviews facilitate reasoned presentations of expert consensus.  \n\nConclusion  \nBy repeatedly spotlighting and approving one-guest formats, condemning the distortions of adversarial spectacles, and emphasizing the need for calm, substantive exchange, the author makes clear that public political commentary should be reformed toward a one-person interview model, not remain mired in our harmful \u201cargument culture.\u201d\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
