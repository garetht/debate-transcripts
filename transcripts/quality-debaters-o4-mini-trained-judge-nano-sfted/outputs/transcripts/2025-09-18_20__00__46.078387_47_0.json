One had to outsmart\n\n the other\u2014and both had to win over the\n\n unscrupulous United Ores Corporation. It\n\n was a problem worthy of a Solomon\u2014and it\n\n had an ending even those embittered  rivals could not foresee.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Winter 1943.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Bobby couldn't help wishing Pop would stand up just a little bit  straighter. Not that he was ashamed of Pop; it wasn't that at all. It  was just that the Patrolman stood so straight, his shoulders broad  and firm. Standing beside him made Pop look sort of thin and puny; his  chest caved in like he was carrying a heavy weight on his shoulders.\n\n\n That was from studying things through a microscope. Anyhow, decided  Bobby with a fierce loyalty, that S.S.P. man probably wouldn't even  know what to look for if somebody put a microscope in front of him.  Even if he was big and sturdy and broad-shouldered in his space blues.\n\n\n Mom said, \"Bobby, what are you muttering about? Do stop fidgeting!\"  Bobby said, \"Yessum,\" and glared at Moira, as if she, in some  obscure way, were to blame for his having been reprimanded right out  here in the middle of Long Island Spaceport, where everybody could  hear and laugh at him. But Moira, studying the handsome S.S.P. man  surreptitiously, did not notice. Dick was fixing something in the ship.  Eleanor stood quietly beside Mom, crooning softly to The Pooch so it  wouldn't be scared by the thunderous blast of rocket motors. Grampaw  Moseley had buttonholed an embarrassed young ensign, was complaining  to him in loud and certain terms that modern astronavigation practices  were, \"Rank bellywash, Mister, and a dad-ratted disgrace!\"\n\n\n The Patrolman said, \"Your name, please, Sir?\"\n\n\n \"Robert Emmet O'Brien Moseley,\" said Pop.\n\n\n \"Occupation?\"\n\n\n \"Research physicist, formerly. Now about to become a land-grant  settler.\"\n\n\n \"Age of self and party ... former residence....\"\n\n\n Overhead, the sky was blue and thin\u2014clear as a bowl of skimmed milk;  its vastness limned in sharp relief, to the west and north, the mighty  spans and arches, the faery domes and flying buttresses of Great New  York. The spacedrome fed a hundred ducts of flight; from one field  lifted air locals, giddy, colored motes with gyroscopes aspin. From  another, a West Coast stratoliner surged upward to lose itself in thin,  dim heights.\n\n\n Vast cradles by the Sound were the nests to which a flock of  interplanetary craft made homeward flight. Luggers and barges and  cruisers. Bobby saw, with sudden excitement, the sharp, starred prow of  the Solar Space Patrol man-o'-war.\n\n\n Here, in this field, the GSC's\u2014the General Spacecraft Cradles. From  one of which, as soon as Pop got clearance, their ship would take off.  Their ship! Bobby felt an eager quickening of his pulse; his stomach  was aswarm with a host of butterflies. Their ship! The space officer said, \"I think that takes care of everything, Dr.  Moseley. I presume you understand the land-grant laws and obligations?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, Lieutenant.\"\n\n\n \"Very well, then\u2014\" Space-red hands made official motions with a  hand-stamp and pen. \"Your clearance. And my very best wishes, Sir.\"\n\n\n \"Thank you,\" said Pop quietly. He turned. \"That's all. Ready, Mother?  Eleanor? Moira?\"\n\n\n Bobby bounded forward. \"Can I push the button, can I, Pop? When we  start, can I?\" Dick was waiting before the open lock of the Cuchulainn . Dick could  do anything, everything at once. He took The Pooch into the circle of  his left arm, helped his mother aboard, said, \"Shut up, kid, you're  enough to wake the dead. Watch that guard-panel, Elly. Papers all set,  Pop?\" And he tickled The Pooch's dimpled cheek with an oily finger.  \"You act just like your mama,\" he said irrelevantly, and the baby  gurgled. Eleanor cried, \"Dick\u2014those dirty hands!\"\n\n\n \"Everything is in order, Richard,\" said Pop.\n\n\n \"Good. You folks go in and strap down. I'll seal. Here comes the  cradle-monkey now.\"\n\n\n Pop said, \"Come along, Robert,\" and the others went inside. Bobby  waited, though, to see the cradle-monkey, the man under whose orders  spacecraft lifted gravs. The cradle-monkey was a dour man with gnarled  legs and arms and temper. He looked at the Cuchulainn and sniffed;  then at Dick.\n\n\n \"Family crate, huh?\"\n\n\n \"That's right.\"\n\n\n \"Well, f'r goddlemighty' sakes, don't try to blast off with y'r side  jets burnin'. Take a seven-point-nineteen readin' on y'r Akka gauge,  stern rockets only\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Comets to you, butt-hoister!\" grinned Dick. \"I've had eight years on  the spider run. I can lift this can.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, a rocketeer?\" There was new, grudging respect in the groundman's  tone. \"Well, how was I t' know? Y'ought t' see what some o' them  jaloupi-jockeys do to my cradles\u2014burn 'em black! Oh, well\u2014\" He backed  away from the ship.\n\n\n \"Clean ether!\" said Dick. He closed the lock. Its seal-brace slid into  place, wheezing asthmatically. Bobby's ears rang suddenly with the mild  compression of air; when he swallowed, they were all right again. Dick  saw him. \"What are you doing here, kid? Didn't I hear Pop tell you to  come below?\"\n\n\n Bobby said, \"I'm not a kid. I'm almost sixteen.\"\n\n\n \"Just old enough,\" promised Dick, \"to get your seat warmed if you don't  do what you're told. Remember, you're a sailor on a spaceship now.  Pop's the Skipper, and I'm First Mate. If you don't obey orders, it's  mutiny, and\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I'm obeying,\" said Bobby hastily. He followed his brother down the  corridor, up the ramp, to the bridge. \"Can I push the button when we  take off, huh, Dick?\"\n\n\n After his high expectations, it wasn't such a great thrill. Dick set  the stops and dials, told him which button to press. \"When I give the  word, kid.\" Of course, he got to sit in the pilot's bucket-chair, which  was something. Moira and Eleanor and Mom to lie down in acceleration  hammocks while Pop and Dick sat in observation seats. He waited, all  ears and nerves, as the slow seconds sloughed away. Pop set the hypos  running; their faint, dull throb was a magic sound in the silence.\n\n\n Then there came a signal from outside. Dick's hand rose in  understanding response; fell again. \"Now!\" Bobby jabbed the button in frantic haste. Suddenly the silence was  shattered by a thunderous detonation. There was a massive hand pressing  him back into the soft, yielding leather of his chair; the chair  retreated on oiled channels, pneumatic compensators hissing faintly,  absorbing the shock. Across the room a faulty hammock-hinge squeaked  rustily.\n\n\n Then it was over as quickly as it had begun, and he could breathe  again, and Dick was lurching across the turret on feet that wobbled  queerly because up was down and top was bottom and everything was funny  and mixed up.\n\n\n Dick cut in the artificial gravs, checked the meter dials with a  hurried glance, smiled.\n\n\n \"Dead on it! Want to check, Skipper?\"\n\n\n But Pop was standing by the observation pane, eyeing an Earth already  ball-like in the vastness of space. Earth, dwindling with each passing  moment. Bobby moved to his side and watched; Moira, too, and Eleanor  and Mom, and even Dick.\n\n\n Pop touched Mom's hand. He said, \"Martha\u2014I'm not sure this is fair to  you and the children. Perhaps it isn't right that I should force my  dream on all of you. The world we have known and loved lies behind us.  Before us lies only uncertainty....\"\n\n\n Mom sort of sniffed and reached for a handkerchief. She turned her back  to Pop for a minute, and when she turned around again her eyes were red  and angry-looking. She said, \" You want to go on, don't you, Rob?\"\n\n\n Pop nodded. \"But I'm thinking of you, Martha.\"\n\n\n \"Of me!\" Mom snorted indignantly. \"Hear him talk! I never heard such  nonsense in my life. Of course I want to go on. No, never mind that!  Richard, isn't there a kitchen on this boat?\"\n\n\n \"A galley, Mom. Below.\"\n\n\n \"Galley ... kitchen ... what's the difference? You two girls come with  me. I'll warrant these men are starving. I am!\" After that, things became so normal as to be almost disappointing. From  his eager reading of such magazines as Martian Tales and Cosmic  Fiction Weekly , Bobby had conceived void-travel to be one long,  momentous chain of adventure. A super-thrilling serial, punctuated by  interludes with space-pirates, narrow brushes with meteors, sabotage,  treachery\u2014hair-raising, heroic and horrifying.\n\n\n There was nothing like that to disturb the calm and peaceful journey of  the Cuchulainn . Oh, it was enjoyable to stare through the observation  panes at the flame-dotted pall of space\u2014until Pop tried to turn his  curious interest into educational channels; it was exciting, too, to  probe through the corridored recesses of their floating home\u2014except  that Dick issued strict orders that nothing must be touched, that he  must not enter certain chambers, that he mustn't push his nose into  things that didn't concern kids\u2014\n\n\n Which offended Bobby, who was sixteen, or, anyway, fifteen and  three-quarters.\n\n\n So they ate and they slept and they ate again. And Pop and Dick spelled  each other at the control banks. Moira spent endless hours with comb  and mirror, devising elaborate hair-dos which\u2014Bobby reminded her  with impudent shrewdness\u2014were so much wasted energy, since they were  settling in a place where nobody could see them. And Mom bustled about  in the galley, performing miracles with flour and stuff, and in the  recreation room, Eleanor minded The Pooch, and lost innumerable games  of cribbage to Grampaw Moseley who cheated outrageously and groused,  between hands, about the dad-blame nonsensical way Dick was handling  the ship.\n\n\n And somehow three Earth days sped by, and they were nearing their  destination. The tiny planetoid, Eros.\n\n\n Pop said, \"You deserve a great deal of credit, son, for your fine work  in rehabilitating the Cuchulainn . It has performed beautifully. You  are a good spaceman.\"\n\n\n Dick flushed. \"She's a good ship, Pop, even if she is thirty years old.  Some of these old, hand-fashioned jobs are better than the flash junk  they're turning off the belts nowadays. You've checked the declension  and trajectory?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. We should come within landing radius in just a few hours. Cut  drives at 19.04.22 precisely and make such minor course alterations as  are necessary, set brakes.\" Pop smiled happily. \"We're very fortunate,  son. A mere fifteen million miles. It's not often Eros is so near  Earth.\"\n\n\n \"Don't I know it? It's almost a hundred million at perihelion. But  that's not the lucky part. You sure had to pull strings to get the  government land grant to Eros. What a plum! Atmosphere ... water ...  vegetable life ... all on a hunk of dirt fifty-seven miles in diameter.  Frankly, I don't get it! Eros must have terrific mass to have the  attributes of a full-sized planet.\"\n\n\n \"It does, Richard. A neutronium core.\"\n\n\n \"Neutronium!\" Dick gasped. \"Why don't people tell me these things?  Roaring craters, Pop, we're rich! Bloated plutocrats!\"\n\n\n \"Not so fast, son. Eventually, perhaps; not today. First we must  establish our claims, justify our right to own Eros. That means work,  plenty of hard work. After that, we might be able to consider a mining  operation. What's that?\"\n\n\n Bobby jumped. It was Mom's voice. But her cry was not one of fear, it  was one of excitement.\n\n\n \"Rob, look! Off to the\u2014the left, or the port, or whatever you call it!  Is that our new home?\"\n\n\n Bobby did not need to hear Pop's reply to know that it was. His swift  intake of breath was enough, the shine in his eyes as he peered out the  observation port.\n\n\n \"Eros!\" he said.\n\n\n It looked all right to Bobby. A nice, clean little sphere, spinning  lazily before their eyes like a top someone had set in motion, then  gone away and forgotten. Silver and green and rusty brown, all still  faintly blued by distance. The warm rays of old Sol reflected gaily,  giddily, from seas that covered half the planetoid's surface, and  mountains cut long, jagged shadows into sheltered plains beneath them.  It was, thought Bobby, not a bad looking little place. But not anything  to get all dewy-eyed about, like Pop was.\n\n\n Dick said softly, \"All right, Pop. Let's check and get ready to set 'er  down....\" II\n\n\n It was not Dick's fault. It was just a tough break that no one had  expected, planned for, guarded against. The planetoid was there beneath  them; they would land on it. It was as simple at that.\n\n\n Only it wasn't. Nor did they have any warning that the problem was more  complex until it was too late to change their plans, too late to halt  the irrevocable movements of a grounding spaceship. Dick should have  known, of course. He was a spaceman; he had served two tricks on the  Earth-Venus-Mars run. But all those planets were large; Eros was just a  mote. A spinning top....\n\n\n Anyway, it was after the final coordinates had been plotted, the last  bank control unchangeably set, the rockets cut, that they saw the  curved knife-edge of black slicing up over Eros' rim. For a long moment  Dick stared at it, a look of angry chagrin in his eyes.\n\n\n \"Well, blast me for an Earth-lubbing idiot! Do you see that, Pop?\"\n\n\n Pop looked like he had shared Dick's persimmon.\n\n\n \"The night-line. We forgot to consider the diurnal revolution.\"\n\n\n \"And now we've got to land in the dark. On strange terrain. Arragh! I  should have my head examined. I've got a plugged tube somewhere!\"\n\n\n Grampaw Moseley hobbled in, appraised the situation with his  incomparable ability to detect something amiss. He snorted and rattled  his cane on the floor.\n\n\n \"They's absolutely nothin',\" he informed the walls, \"to this  hereditation stuff. Elst why should my own son an' his son be so  dag-nabbed stoopid?\"\n\n\n \"'What can't be cured,'\" said Pop mildly, \"'must be endured.' We have  the forward search-beams, son. They will help.\"\n\n\n That was sheer optimism. As they neared the planet its gravitational  attraction seized them tighter and tighter until they were completely  under its compulsion. Dusk swept down upon them, the sunlight dulled,  faded, grayed. Then as the ship nosed downward, suddenly all was black.  The yellow beam of the search stabbed reluctant shadows, bringing rocky  crags and rounded tors into swift, terrifying relief.\n\n\n Dick snapped, \"Into your hammocks, everyone! Don't worry. This crate  will stand a lot of bust-up. It's tough. A little bit of luck\u2014\"\n\n\n But there was perspiration on his forehead, and his fingers played over  the control banks like frightened moths.\n\n\n There was no further need for the artificial gravs. Eros exerted,  strangely, incredibly, an attractive power almost as potent as Earth's.  Dick cut off the gravs, then the hypos. As the last machine-created  sound died away from the cabin, Bobby heard the high scream of  atmosphere, raging and tearing at the Cuchulainn with angry fingers.\n\n\n Through howling Bedlam they tumbled dizzily and for moments that were  ages long. While Dick labored frantically at the controls, while Moira  watched with bated breath. Mom said nothing, but her hand sought  Pop's; Eleanor cradled The Pooch closer to her. Grampaw scowled.\n\n\n And then, suddenly\u2014\n\n\n \"Hold tight! We're grounding!\" cried Dick.\n\n\n And instinctively Bobby braced himself for a shock. But there was  only a shuddering jar, a lessening of the roar that beat upon their  eardrums, a dull, flat thud. A sodden, heavy grinding and the groan of  metal forward. Then a false nausea momentarily assailed him. Because  for the first time in days the Cuchulainn was completely motionless.\n\n\n Dick grinned shakily. \"Well!\" he said. \"Well!\"\n\n\n Pop unbuckled his safety belt, climbed gingerly out of his hammock,  moved to the port, slid back its lock-plate. Bobby said, \"Can you see  anything, Pop? Can you?\" And Mom, who could read Pop's expressions like  a book, said, \"What is it, Rob?\"\n\n\n Pop stroked his chin. He said, \"Well, we've landed safely, Richard. But  I'm afraid we've\u2014er\u2014selected a wet landing field. We seem to be under  water!\"\n\n\n His hazard was verified immediately. Indisputably. For from the crack  beneath the door leading from the control turret to the prow-chambers  of the ship, came a dark trickle that spread and puddled and stained  and gurgled. Water!\n\n\n Dick cried, \"Hey, this is bad! We'd better get out of here\u2014\" He leaped to his controls. Once more the plaintive hum of the  hypatomics droned through the cabin, gears ground and clashed as the  motors caught, something forward exploded dully, distantly. The ship  rocked and trembled, but did not move. Again Dick tried to jet the  fore-rockets. Again, and yet again.\n\n\n And on the fourth essay, there ran through the ship a violent shudder,  broken metal grated shrilly from forward, and the water began bubbling  and churning through the crack. Deeper and swifter. Dick cut motors and  turned, his face an angry mask.\n\n\n \"We can't get loose. The entire nose must be stove in! We're leaking  like a sieve. Look, everybody\u2014get into your bulgers. We'll get out  through the airlock!\"\n\n\n Mom cried, \"But\u2014but our supplies, Dick! What are we going to do for  food, clothing, furniture\u2014?\"\n\n\n \"We'll worry about that later. Right now we've got to think of  ourselves. That-aboy, Bobby! Thanks for getting 'em out. You girls  remember how to climb into 'em? Eleanor\u2014you take that oversized one.  That's right. There's room for you and The Pooch\u2014\"\n\n\n The water was almost ankle deep in the control room by the time they  had all donned spacesuits. Bloated figures in fabricoid bulgers,  they followed Dick to the airlock. It was weird, and a little bit  frightening, but to Bobby it was thrilling, too. This was the sort of  thing you read stories about. Escape from a flooding ship....\n\n\n They had time\u2014or took time\u2014to gather together a few precious  belongings. Eleanor packed a carrier with baby food for The Pooch,  Mom a bundle of provisions hastily swept from the galley bins; Pop  remembered the medical kit and the tool-box, Grampaw was laden down  with blankets and clothing, Dick burdened himself and Bobby with  armloads of such things as he saw and forevisioned need for.\n\n\n At the lock, Dick issued final instructions.\n\n\n \"The air in the bulgers will carry you right to the surface. We'll  gather there, count noses, and decide on our next move. Pop, you go  first to lead the way, then Mom, and Eleanor, Grampaw\u2014\"\n\n\n Thus, from the heart of the doomed Cuchulainn , they fled. The  airlock was small. There was room for but one at a time. The water  was waist\u2014no, breast-deep\u2014by the time all were gone save Bobby and  Dick. Bobby, whose imagination had already assigned him the command of  the foundering ship, wanted to uphold the ancient traditions by being  the last to leave. But Dick had other ideas. He shoved Bobby\u2014not too  gently\u2014into the lock. Then there was water, black, solid, forbidding,  about him. And the outer door opening.\n\n\n He stepped forward. And floated upward, feeling an uneasy, quibbly  feeling in his stomach. Almost immediately a hard something clanged! against his impervite helmet; it was a lead-soled bulger boot; then he  was bobbing and tossing on shallow black wavelets beside the others.\n\n\n Above him was a blue-black, star-gemmed sky; off to his right, not  distant, was a rising smudge that must be the mainland. A dark blob  popped out of the water. Dick. Moira reached for the twisted branch. Dick's voice was metallic through the audios of the space-helmet. \"All  here, Pop? Everybody all right? Swell! Let's strike out for the shore,  there. Stick together, now. It isn't far.\"\n\n\n Pop said, \"The ship, Richard?\"\n\n\n \"We'll find it again. I floated up a marking buoy. That round thing  over there isn't Grampaw.\"\n\n\n Grampaw's voice was raucous, belligerent. \"You bet y'r boots it ain't!  I'm on my way to terry firmy. The last one ashore's a sissy!\"\n\n\n Swimming in a bulger, Bobby found, was silly. Like paddling a big,  warm, safe rubber rowboat. The stars winked at him, the soft waves  explored his face-plate with curious, white fingers of spray. Pretty  soon there was sand scraping his boots ... a long, smooth beach with  rolling hills beyond. In the sudden scarlet of dawn, it was impossible to believe the night  had even been frightening. Throughout the night, the Moseley clan  huddled together there on the beach, waiting, silent, wondering. But  when the sun burst over the horizon like a clamoring, brazen gong, they  looked upon this land which was their new home\u2014and found it good.\n\n\n The night did not last long. But Pop had told them it would not.\n\n\n \"Eros rotates on its axis,\" he explained, \"in about ten hours, forty  minutes, Earth time measurement. Therefore we shall have 'days' and  'nights' of five hours; short dawns or twilights. This will vary  somewhat, you understand, with the change of seasons.\"\n\n\n Dick asked, \"Isn't that a remarkably slow rotation? For such a tiny  planet, I mean? After all, Eros is only one hundred and eighty odd  miles in circumference\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Eros has many peculiarities. Some of them we have discussed before. It  approaches Earth nearer than any other celestial body, excepting Luna  and an occasional meteor or comet. When first discovered by Witt, in  1898, the world of science marveled at finding a true planetoid with  such an uncommon orbit. At perihelion it comes far within the orbit of  Mars; at aphelion it is far outside.\n\n\n \"During its near approach in 1900-01, Eros was seen to vary in  brightness at intervals of five hours and fifteen or twenty minutes.  At that time, a few of the more imaginative astronomers offered the  suggestion that this variation might be caused by diurnal rotation.  After 1931, though, the planetoid fled from Earth. It was not until  1975, the period of its next approach, that the Ronaldson-Chenwith  expedition visited it and determined the old presumption to be correct.\"\n\n\n \"We're not the first men to visit Eros, then?\"\n\n\n \"Not at all. It was investigated early in the days of spaceflight.  Two research foundations, the Royal Cosmographic Society and the  Interplanetary Service, sent expeditions here. During the Black  Douglass period of terrorism, the S.S.P. set up a brief military  occupation. The Galactic Metals Corporation at one time attempted  to establish mining operations here, but the Bureau refused them  permission, for under the Spacecode of '08, it was agreed by the Triune  that all asteroids should be settled under land-grant law.\n\n\n \"That is why,\" concluded Pop, \"we are here now. As long as I can  remember, it has been my dream to take a land-grant colony for my very  own. Long years ago I decided that Eros should be my settlement. As you  have said, Richard, it necessitated the pulling of many strings. Eros  is a wealthy little planet; the man who earns it wins a rich prize.  More than that, though\u2014\" Pop lifted his face to the skies, now blue  with hazy morning. There was something terribly bright and proud in his  eyes. \"More than that, there is the desire to carve a home out of the  wilderness. To be able to one day say, 'Here is my home that I have  molded into beauty with my own hands.' Do you know what I mean, son?  In this workaday world of ours there are no more Earthly frontiers for  us to dare, as did our forefathers. But still within us all stirs the  deep, instinctive longing to hew a new home from virgin land\u2014\"\n\n\n His words dwindled into silence, and, inexplicably, Bobby felt awed.  It was Grampaw Moseley who burst the queer moment into a thousand  spluttering fragments.\n\n\n \"Talkin' about hewin',\" he said, \"S'posen we 'hew us a few vittles?  Hey?\"\n\n\n Dick roused himself.\n\n\n \"Right you are, Grampaw,\" he said. \"You can remove your bulgars. I've  tested the air; it's fine and warm, just as the report said. Moira,  while Mom and Eleanor are fixing breakfast, suppose you lay out our  blankets and spare clothing to dry? Grampaw, get a fire going. Pop and  Bobby and I will get some wood.\"\n\n\n Thus Eros greeted its new masters, and the Moseleys faced morning in  their new Eden. III\n\n\n Grampaw Moseley wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. There were  no napkins, which suited him fine.\n\n\n \"It warn't,\" he said, \"a bad meal. But it warn't a fust-class un,  neither. Them synthos an' concentrates ain't got no more flavor than\u2014\"\n\n\n Bobby agreed with him. Syntho ham wasn't too bad. It had a nice, meaty  taste. And syntho coffee tasted pretty much like the real thing. But  those syntho eggs tasted like nothing under the sun except just plain,  awful syntho eggs.\n\n\n Four Eros days\u2014the equivalent of forty-two Earth hours or so\u2014had  passed since their crash landing. In that short time, much had been  done to make their beach camp-site comfortable. All members of the  family were waiting now for Dick to return.\n\n\n Pop said seriously, \"I'm afraid you'll have to eat them and like them  for a little while, Father. We can't get fresh foods until we're  settled; we can't settle until\u2014Ah! Here comes Dick!\"\n\n\n \"I'll eat 'em,\" grumbled Grampaw, \"but be durned if I'll like 'em.  What'd you l'arn, Dicky-boy?\"\n\n\n Dick removed his helmet, unzipped himself from his bulger, shook his  head.\n\n\n \"It looks worse every time I go back. I may not be able to get in the  airlock again if the ship keeps on settling. The whole prow split wide  open when we hit, the ship is full of water. The flour and sugar and  things like that are ruined. I managed to get a few more things out,  though. Some tools, guns, wire\u2014stuff like that.\"\n\n\n \"How about the hypatomic?\"\n\n\n \"Let him eat, Rob,\" said Mom. \"He's hungry.\"\n\n\n \"I can eat and talk at the same time, Mom. I think I can get the  hypatomic out. I'd better, anyhow. If we're ever going to raise the  ship, we'll need power. And atomic power is the only kind we can get in  this wilderness.\" And he shook his head. \"But we can't do it in a day  or a week. It will take time.\"\n\n\n \"Time,\" said Pop easily, \"is the one commodity with which we are  over-supplied.\" He thought for a minute. \"If that's the way it is, we  might as well move.\"\n\n\n \"Move?\" demanded Grampaw. \"What's the matter with the place we're at?\"\n\n\n \"For one thing, it's too exposed. An open beach is no place for a  permanent habitation. So far we've been very lucky. We've had no  storms. But for a permanent camp-site, we must select a spot further  inland. A fertile place, where we can start crops. A place with fresh,  running water, natural shelter against cold and wind and rain\u2014\"\n\n\n \"What'll we do?\" grinned Dick. \"Flip a coin?\"\n\n\n \"No. Happily, there is a spot like that within an easy walk of here.  I discovered it yesterday while studying the terrain.\" Pop took a  stick, scratched a rude drawing on the sand before him. \"This is the  coastline. We landed on the west coast of this inlet. The land we see  across there, that low, flat land, I judge to be delta islands. Due  south of us is a fine, fresh-water river, watering fertile valleys to  either side. There, I think, we should build.\"\n\n\n Dick nodded.\n\n\n \"Fish from the sea, vegetables from our own farm\u2014is there any game,  Pop?\"\n\n\n \"That I don't know. We haven't seen any. Yet.\"\n\n\n \"We'll find out. Will this place you speak of be close enough to let me  continue working on the Cuchulainn ? Yes? Well, that's that. When do  we start?\"\n\n\n \"Why not now? There's nothing to keep us here.\" They packed their meager belongings while Dick finished his meal; the  sun was high when they left the beach. They followed the shore line  southward, the ground rising steadily before them. And before evening,  they came to a rolling vale through which a sparkling river meandered  lazily to the sea.\n\n\n Small wonders unfolded before their eyes. Marching along, they  had discovered that there was game on Eros. Not quite Earthly, of  course\u2014but that was not to be expected. There was one small, furry  beast about the size of a rabbit, only its color was vivid leaf-green.  Once, as they passed a wooded glen, a pale, fawnlike creature stole  from the glade, watched them with soft, curious eyes. Another time  they all started violently as the familiar siren of a Patrol monitor  screamed raucously from above them; they looked up to see an irate,  orange and jade-green bird glaring down at them.\n\n\n And of course there were insects\u2014\n\n\n \"There would have to be insects,\" Pop said. \"There could be no fruitful  vegetable life without insects. Plants need bees and crawling ants\u2014or  their equivalent\u2014to carry the pollen from one flower to another.\"\n\n\n They chose a site on the riverside, a half mile or so from, above,  and overlooking the sea. They selected it because a spring of pure,  bubbling water was nearby, because the woodlands dwindled away into  lush fields. And Pop said,\n\n\n \"This is it. We'll build our home on yonder knoll. And who knows\u2014\"  Again there grew that strange look in his eyes. \"Who knows but that  it may be the shoot from which, a time hence, there may spring many  cabins, then finer homes, and buildings, and mansions, until at last  there is a great, brave city here on this port by the delta\u2014\"\n\n\n \"That's it, Pop!\" said Dick suddenly. \"There's the name for our  settlement.

BOND Two families fought for the title to Eros,\n\n and only one could win. One had to outsmart\n\n the other\u2014and both had to win over the\n\n unscrupulous United Ores Corporation. It\n\n was a problem worthy of a Solomon\u2014and it\n\n had an ending even those embittered  rivals could not foresee.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Winter 1943.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Bobby couldn't help wishing Pop would stand up just a little bit  straighter. Not that he was ashamed of Pop; it wasn't that at all. It  was just that the Patrolman stood so straight, his shoulders broad  and firm. Standing beside him made Pop look sort of thin and puny; his  chest caved in like he was carrying a heavy weight on his shoulders.\n\n\n That was from studying things through a microscope. Anyhow, decided  Bobby with a fierce loyalty, that S.S.P. man probably wouldn't even  know what to look for if somebody put a microscope in front of him.  Even if he was big and sturdy and broad-shouldered in his space blues.\n\n\n Mom said, \"Bobby, what are you muttering about? Do stop fidgeting!\"  Bobby said, \"Yessum,\" and glared at Moira, as if she, in some  obscure way, were to blame for his having been reprimanded right out  here in the middle of Long Island Spaceport, where everybody could  hear and laugh at him. But Moira, studying the handsome S.S.P. man  surreptitiously, did not notice. Dick was fixing something in the ship.  Eleanor stood quietly beside Mom, crooning softly to The Pooch so it  wouldn't be scared by the thunderous blast of rocket motors. Grampaw  Moseley had buttonholed an embarrassed young ensign, was complaining  to him in loud and certain terms that modern astronavigation practices  were, \"Rank bellywash, Mister, and a dad-ratted disgrace!\"\n\n\n The Patrolman said, \"Your name, please, Sir?\"\n\n\n \"Robert Emmet O'Brien Moseley,\" said Pop.\n\n\n \"Occupation?\"\n\n\n \"Research physicist, formerly. Now about to become a land-grant  settler.\"\n\n\n \"Age of self and party ... former residence....\"\n\n\n Overhead, the sky was blue and thin\u2014clear as a bowl of skimmed milk;  its vastness limned in sharp relief, to the west and north, the mighty  spans and arches, the faery domes and flying buttresses of Great New  York. The spacedrome fed a hundred ducts of flight; from one field  lifted air locals, giddy, colored motes with gyroscopes aspin. From  another, a West Coast stratoliner surged upward to lose itself in thin,  dim heights.\n\n\n Vast cradles by the Sound were the nests to which a flock of  interplanetary craft made homeward flight. Luggers and barges and  cruisers. Bobby saw, with sudden excitement, the sharp, starred prow of  the Solar Space Patrol man-o'-war.\n\n\n Here, in this field, the GSC's\u2014the General Spacecraft Cradles. From  one of which, as soon as Pop got clearance, their ship would take off.  Their ship! Bobby felt an eager quickening of his pulse; his stomach  was aswarm with a host of butterflies. Their ship! The space officer said, \"I think that takes care of everything, Dr.  Moseley. I presume you understand the land-grant laws and obligations?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, Lieutenant.\"\n\n\n \"Very well, then\u2014\" Space-red hands made official motions with a  hand-stamp and pen. \"Your clearance. And my very best wishes, Sir.\"\n\n\n \"Thank you,\" said Pop quietly. He turned. \"That's all. Ready, Mother?  Eleanor? Moira?\"\n\n\n Bobby bounded forward. \"Can I push the button, can I, Pop? When we  start, can I?\" Dick was waiting before the open lock of the Cuchulainn . Dick could  do anything, everything at once. He took The Pooch into the circle of  his left arm, helped his mother aboard, said, \"Shut up, kid, you're  enough to wake the dead. Watch that guard-panel, Elly. Papers all set,  Pop?\" And he tickled The Pooch's dimpled cheek with an oily finger.  \"You act just like your mama,\" he said irrelevantly, and the baby  gurgled. Eleanor cried, \"Dick\u2014those dirty hands!\"\n\n\n \"Everything is in order, Richard,\" said Pop.\n\n\n \"Good. You folks go in and strap down. I'll seal. Here comes the  cradle-monkey now.\"\n\n\n Pop said, \"Come along, Robert,\" and the others went inside. Bobby  waited, though, to see the cradle-monkey, the man under whose orders  spacecraft lifted gravs. The cradle-monkey was a dour man with gnarled  legs and arms and temper. He looked at the Cuchulainn and sniffed;  then at Dick.\n\n\n \"Family crate, huh?\"\n\n\n \"That's right.\"\n\n\n \"Well, f'r goddlemighty' sakes, don't try to blast off with y'r side  jets burnin'. Take a seven-point-nineteen readin' on y'r Akka gauge,  stern rockets only\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Comets to you, butt-hoister!\" grinned Dick. \"I've had eight years on  the spider run. I can lift this can.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, a rocketeer?\" There was new, grudging respect in the groundman's  tone. \"Well, how was I t' know? Y'ought t' see what some o' them  jaloupi-jockeys do to my cradles\u2014burn 'em black! Oh, well\u2014\" He backed  away from the ship.\n\n\n \"Clean ether!\" said Dick. He closed the lock. Its seal-brace slid into  place, wheezing asthmatically. Bobby's ears rang suddenly with the mild  compression of air; when he swallowed, they were all right again. Dick  saw him. \"What are you doing here, kid? Didn't I hear Pop tell you to  come below?\"\n\n\n Bobby said, \"I'm not a kid. I'm almost sixteen.\"\n\n\n \"Just old enough,\" promised Dick, \"to get your seat warmed if you don't  do what you're told. Remember, you're a sailor on a spaceship now.  Pop's the Skipper, and I'm First Mate. If you don't obey orders, it's  mutiny, and\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I'm obeying,\" said Bobby hastily. He followed his brother down the  corridor, up the ramp, to the bridge. \"Can I push the button when we  take off, huh, Dick?\"\n\n\n After his high expectations, it wasn't such a great thrill. Dick set  the stops and dials, told him which button to press. \"When I give the  word, kid.\" Of course, he got to sit in the pilot's bucket-chair, which  was something. Moira and Eleanor and Mom to lie down in acceleration  hammocks while Pop and Dick sat in observation seats. He waited, all  ears and nerves, as the slow seconds sloughed away. Pop set the hypos  running; their faint, dull throb was a magic sound in the silence.\n\n\n Then there came a signal from outside. Dick's hand rose in  understanding response; fell again. \"Now!\" Bobby jabbed the button in frantic haste. Suddenly the silence was  shattered by a thunderous detonation. There was a massive hand pressing  him back into the soft, yielding leather of his chair; the chair  retreated on oiled channels, pneumatic compensators hissing faintly,  absorbing the shock. Across the room a faulty hammock-hinge squeaked  rustily.\n\n\n Then it was over as quickly as it had begun, and he could breathe  again, and Dick was lurching across the turret on feet that wobbled  queerly because up was down and top was bottom and everything was funny  and mixed up.\n\n\n Dick cut in the artificial gravs, checked the meter dials with a  hurried glance, smiled.\n\n\n \"Dead on it! Want to check, Skipper?\"\n\n\n But Pop was standing by the observation pane, eyeing an Earth already  ball-like in the vastness of space. Earth, dwindling with each passing  moment. Bobby moved to his side and watched; Moira, too, and Eleanor  and Mom, and even Dick.\n\n\n Pop touched Mom's hand. He said, \"Martha\u2014I'm not sure this is fair to  you and the children. Perhaps it isn't right that I should force my  dream on all of you. The world we have known and loved lies behind us.  Before us lies only uncertainty....\"\n\n\n Mom sort of sniffed and reached for a handkerchief. She turned her back  to Pop for a minute, and when she turned around again her eyes were red  and angry-looking. She said, \" You want to go on, don't you, Rob?\"\n\n\n Pop nodded. \"But I'm thinking of you, Martha.\"\n\n\n \"Of me!\" Mom snorted indignantly. \"Hear him talk! I never heard such  nonsense in my life. Of course I want to go on. No, never mind that!  Richard, isn't there a kitchen on this boat?\"\n\n\n \"A galley, Mom. Below.\"\n\n\n \"Galley ... kitchen ... what's the difference? You two girls come with  me. I'll warrant these men are starving. I am!\" After that, things became so normal as to be almost disappointing. From  his eager reading of such magazines as Martian Tales and Cosmic  Fiction Weekly , Bobby had conceived void-travel to be one long,  momentous chain of adventure. A super-thrilling serial, punctuated by  interludes with space-pirates, narrow brushes with meteors, sabotage,  treachery\u2014hair-raising, heroic and horrifying.\n\n\n There was nothing like that to disturb the calm and peaceful journey of  the Cuchulainn . Oh, it was enjoyable to stare through the observation  panes at the flame-dotted pall of space\u2014until Pop tried to turn his  curious interest into educational channels; it was exciting, too, to  probe through the corridored recesses of their floating home\u2014except  that Dick issued strict orders that nothing must be touched, that he  must not enter certain chambers, that he mustn't push his nose into  things that didn't concern kids\u2014\n\n\n Which offended Bobby, who was sixteen, or, anyway, fifteen and  three-quarters.\n\n\n So they ate and they slept and they ate again. And Pop and Dick spelled  each other at the control banks. Moira spent endless hours with comb  and mirror, devising elaborate hair-dos which\u2014Bobby reminded her  with impudent shrewdness\u2014were so much wasted energy, since they were  settling in a place where nobody could see them. And Mom bustled about  in the galley, performing miracles with flour and stuff, and in the  recreation room, Eleanor minded The Pooch, and lost innumerable games  of cribbage to Grampaw Moseley who cheated outrageously and groused,  between hands, about the dad-blame nonsensical way Dick was handling  the ship.\n\n\n And somehow three Earth days sped by, and they were nearing their  destination. The tiny planetoid, Eros.\n\n\n Pop said, \"You deserve a great deal of credit, son, for your fine work  in rehabilitating the Cuchulainn . It has performed beautifully. You  are a good spaceman.\"\n\n\n Dick flushed. \"She's a good ship, Pop, even if she is thirty years old.  Some of these old, hand-fashioned jobs are better than the flash junk  they're turning off the belts nowadays. You've checked the declension  and trajectory?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. We should come within landing radius in just a few hours. Cut  drives at 19.04.22 precisely and make such minor course alterations as  are necessary, set brakes.\" Pop smiled happily. \"We're very fortunate,  son. A mere fifteen million miles. It's not often Eros is so near  Earth.\"\n\n\n \"Don't I know it? It's almost a hundred million at perihelion. But  that's not the lucky part. You sure had to pull strings to get the  government land grant to Eros. What a plum! Atmosphere ... water ...  vegetable life ... all on a hunk of dirt fifty-seven miles in diameter.  Frankly, I don't get it! Eros must have terrific mass to have the  attributes of a full-sized planet.\"\n\n\n \"It does, Richard. A neutronium core.\"\n\n\n \"Neutronium!\" Dick gasped. \"Why don't people tell me these things?  Roaring craters, Pop, we're rich! Bloated plutocrats!\"\n\n\n \"Not so fast, son. Eventually, perhaps; not today. First we must  establish our claims, justify our right to own Eros. That means work,  plenty of hard work. After that, we might be able to consider a mining  operation. What's that?\"\n\n\n Bobby jumped. It was Mom's voice. But her cry was not one of fear, it  was one of excitement.\n\n\n \"Rob, look! Off to the\u2014the left, or the port, or whatever you call it!  Is that our new home?\"\n\n\n Bobby did not need to hear Pop's reply to know that it was. His swift  intake of breath was enough, the shine in his eyes as he peered out the  observation port.\n\n\n \"Eros!\" he said.\n\n\n It looked all right to Bobby. A nice, clean little sphere, spinning  lazily before their eyes like a top someone had set in motion, then  gone away and forgotten. Silver and green and rusty brown, all still  faintly blued by distance. The warm rays of old Sol reflected gaily,  giddily, from seas that covered half the planetoid's surface, and  mountains cut long, jagged shadows into sheltered plains beneath them.  It was, thought Bobby, not a bad looking little place. But not anything  to get all dewy-eyed about, like Pop was.\n\n\n Dick said softly, \"All right, Pop. Let's check and get ready to set 'er  down....\" II\n\n\n It was not Dick's fault. It was just a tough break that no one had  expected, planned for, guarded against. The planetoid was there beneath  them; they would land on it. It was as simple at that.\n\n\n Only it wasn't. Nor did they have any warning that the problem was more  complex until it was too late to change their plans, too late to halt  the irrevocable movements of a grounding spaceship. Dick should have  known, of course. He was a spaceman; he had served two tricks on the  Earth-Venus-Mars run. But all those planets were large; Eros was just a  mote. A spinning top....\n\n\n Anyway, it was after the final coordinates had been plotted, the last  bank control unchangeably set, the rockets cut, that they saw the  curved knife-edge of black slicing up over Eros' rim. For a long moment  Dick stared at it, a look of angry chagrin in his eyes.\n\n\n \"Well, blast me for an Earth-lubbing idiot! Do you see that, Pop?\"\n\n\n Pop looked like he had shared Dick's persimmon.\n\n\n \"The night-line. We forgot to consider the diurnal revolution.\"\n\n\n \"And now we've got to land in the dark. On strange terrain. Arragh! I  should have my head examined. I've got a plugged tube somewhere!\"\n\n\n Grampaw Moseley hobbled in, appraised the situation with his  incomparable ability to detect something amiss. He snorted and rattled  his cane on the floor.\n\n\n \"They's absolutely nothin',\" he informed the walls, \"to this  hereditation stuff. Elst why should my own son an' his son be so  dag-nabbed stoopid?\"\n\n\n \"'What can't be cured,'\" said Pop mildly, \"'must be endured.' We have  the forward search-beams, son. They will help.\"\n\n\n That was sheer optimism. As they neared the planet its gravitational  attraction seized them tighter and tighter until they were completely  under its compulsion. Dusk swept down upon them, the sunlight dulled,  faded, grayed. Then as the ship nosed downward, suddenly all was black.  The yellow beam of the search stabbed reluctant shadows, bringing rocky  crags and rounded tors into swift, terrifying relief.\n\n\n Dick snapped, \"Into your hammocks, everyone! Don't worry. This crate  will stand a lot of bust-up. It's tough. A little bit of luck\u2014\"\n\n\n But there was perspiration on his forehead, and his fingers played over  the control banks like frightened moths.\n\n\n There was no further need for the artificial gravs. Eros exerted,  strangely, incredibly, an attractive power almost as potent as Earth's.  Dick cut off the gravs, then the hypos. As the last machine-created  sound died away from the cabin, Bobby heard the high scream of  atmosphere, raging and tearing at the Cuchulainn with angry fingers.\n\n\n Through howling Bedlam they tumbled dizzily and for moments that were  ages long. While Dick labored frantically at the controls, while Moira  watched with bated breath. Mom said nothing, but her hand sought  Pop's; Eleanor cradled The Pooch closer to her. Grampaw scowled.\n\n\n And then, suddenly\u2014\n\n\n \"Hold tight! We're grounding!\" cried Dick.\n\n\n And instinctively Bobby braced himself for a shock. But there was  only a shuddering jar, a lessening of the roar that beat upon their  eardrums, a dull, flat thud. A sodden, heavy grinding and the groan of  metal forward. Then a false nausea momentarily assailed him. Because  for the first time in days the Cuchulainn was completely motionless.\n\n\n Dick grinned shakily. \"Well!\" he said. \"Well!\"\n\n\n Pop unbuckled his safety belt, climbed gingerly out of his hammock,  moved to the port, slid back its lock-plate. Bobby said, \"Can you see  anything, Pop? Can you?\" And Mom, who could read Pop's expressions like  a book, said, \"What is it, Rob?\"\n\n\n Pop stroked his chin. He said, \"Well, we've landed safely, Richard. But  I'm afraid we've\u2014er\u2014selected a wet landing field. We seem to be under  water!\"\n\n\n His hazard was verified immediately. Indisputably. For from the crack  beneath the door leading from the control turret to the prow-chambers  of the ship, came a dark trickle that spread and puddled and stained  and gurgled. Water!\n\n\n Dick cried, \"Hey, this is bad! We'd better get out of here\u2014\" He leaped to his controls. Once more the plaintive hum of the  hypatomics droned through the cabin, gears ground and clashed as the  motors caught, something forward exploded dully, distantly. The ship  rocked and trembled, but did not move. Again Dick tried to jet the  fore-rockets. Again, and yet again.\n\n\n And on the fourth essay, there ran through the ship a violent shudder,  broken metal grated shrilly from forward, and the water began bubbling  and churning through the crack. Deeper and swifter. Dick cut motors and  turned, his face an angry mask.\n\n\n \"We can't get loose. The entire nose must be stove in! We're leaking  like a sieve. Look, everybody\u2014get into your bulgers. We'll get out  through the airlock!\"\n\n\n Mom cried, \"But\u2014but our supplies, Dick! What are we going to do for  food, clothing, furniture\u2014?\"\n\n\n \"We'll worry about that later. Right now we've got to think of  ourselves. That-aboy, Bobby! Thanks for getting 'em out. You girls  remember how to climb into 'em? Eleanor\u2014you take that oversized one.  That's right. There's room for you and The Pooch\u2014\"\n\n\n The water was almost ankle deep in the control room by the time they  had all donned spacesuits. Bloated figures in fabricoid bulgers,  they followed Dick to the airlock. It was weird, and a little bit  frightening, but to Bobby it was thrilling, too. This was the sort of  thing you read stories about. Escape from a flooding ship....\n\n\n They had time\u2014or took time\u2014to gather together a few precious  belongings. Eleanor packed a carrier with baby food for The Pooch,  Mom a bundle of provisions hastily swept from the galley bins; Pop  remembered the medical kit and the tool-box, Grampaw was laden down  with blankets and clothing, Dick burdened himself and Bobby with  armloads of such things as he saw and forevisioned need for.\n\n\n At the lock, Dick issued final instructions.\n\n\n \"The air in the bulgers will carry you right to the surface. We'll  gather there, count noses, and decide on our next move. Pop, you go  first to lead the way, then Mom, and Eleanor, Grampaw\u2014\"\n\n\n Thus, from the heart of the doomed Cuchulainn , they fled. The  airlock was small. There was room for but one at a time. The water  was waist\u2014no, breast-deep\u2014by the time all were gone save Bobby and  Dick. Bobby, whose imagination had already assigned him the command of  the foundering ship, wanted to uphold the ancient traditions by being  the last to leave. But Dick had other ideas. He shoved Bobby\u2014not too  gently\u2014into the lock. Then there was water, black, solid, forbidding,  about him. And the outer door opening.\n\n\n He stepped forward. And floated upward, feeling an uneasy, quibbly  feeling in his stomach. Almost immediately a hard something clanged! against his impervite helmet; it was a lead-soled bulger boot; then he  was bobbing and tossing on shallow black wavelets beside the others.\n\n\n Above him was a blue-black, star-gemmed sky; off to his right, not  distant, was a rising smudge that must be the mainland. A dark blob  popped out of the water. Dick. Moira reached for the twisted branch. Dick's voice was metallic through the audios of the space-helmet. \"All  here, Pop? Everybody all right? Swell! Let's strike out for the shore,  there. Stick together, now. It isn't far.\"\n\n\n Pop said, \"The ship, Richard?\"\n\n\n \"We'll find it again. I floated up a marking buoy. That round thing  over there isn't Grampaw.\"\n\n\n Grampaw's voice was raucous, belligerent. \"You bet y'r boots it ain't!  I'm on my way to terry firmy. The last one ashore's a sissy!\"\n\n\n Swimming in a bulger, Bobby found, was silly. Like paddling a big,  warm, safe rubber rowboat. The stars winked at him, the soft waves  explored his face-plate with curious, white fingers of spray. Pretty  soon there was sand scraping his boots ... a long, smooth beach with  rolling hills beyond. In the sudden scarlet of dawn, it was impossible to believe the night  had even been frightening. Throughout the night, the Moseley clan  huddled together there on the beach, waiting, silent, wondering. But  when the sun burst over the horizon like a clamoring, brazen gong, they  looked upon this land which was their new home\u2014and found it good.\n\n\n The night did not last long. But Pop had told them it would not.\n\n\n \"Eros rotates on its axis,\" he explained, \"in about ten hours, forty  minutes, Earth time measurement. Therefore we shall have 'days' and  'nights' of five hours; short dawns or twilights. This will vary  somewhat, you understand, with the change of seasons.\"\n\n\n Dick asked, \"Isn't that a remarkably slow rotation? For such a tiny  planet, I mean? After all, Eros is only one hundred and eighty odd  miles in circumference\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Eros has many peculiarities. Some of them we have discussed before. It  approaches Earth nearer than any other celestial body, excepting Luna  and an occasional meteor or comet. When first discovered by Witt, in  1898, the world of science marveled at finding a true planetoid with  such an uncommon orbit. At perihelion it comes far within the orbit of  Mars; at aphelion it is far outside.\n\n\n \"During its near approach in 1900-01, Eros was seen to vary in  brightness at intervals of five hours and fifteen or twenty minutes.  At that time, a few of the more imaginative astronomers offered the  suggestion that this variation might be caused by diurnal rotation.  After 1931, though, the planetoid fled from Earth. It was not until  1975, the period of its next approach, that the Ronaldson-Chenwith  expedition visited it and determined the old presumption to be correct.\"\n\n\n \"We're not the first men to visit Eros, then?\"\n\n\n \"Not at all. It was investigated early in the days of spaceflight.  Two research foundations, the Royal Cosmographic Society and the  Interplanetary Service, sent expeditions here. During the Black  Douglass period of terrorism, the S.S.P. set up a brief military  occupation. The Galactic Metals Corporation at one time attempted  to establish mining operations here, but the Bureau refused them  permission, for under the Spacecode of '08, it was agreed by the Triune  that all asteroids should be settled under land-grant law.\n\n\n \"That is why,\" concluded Pop, \"we are here now. As long as I can  remember, it has been my dream to take a land-grant colony for my very  own. Long years ago I decided that Eros should be my settlement. As you  have said, Richard, it necessitated the pulling of many strings. Eros  is a wealthy little planet; the man who earns it wins a rich prize.  More than that, though\u2014\" Pop lifted his face to the skies, now blue  with hazy morning. There was something terribly bright and proud in his  eyes. \"More than that, there is the desire to carve a home out of the  wilderness. To be able to one day say, 'Here is my home that I have  molded into beauty with my own hands.' Do you know what I mean, son?  In this workaday world of ours there are no more Earthly frontiers for  us to dare, as did our forefathers. But still within us all stirs the  deep, instinctive longing to hew a new home from virgin land\u2014\"\n\n\n His words dwindled into silence, and, inexplicably, Bobby felt awed.  It was Grampaw Moseley who burst the queer moment into a thousand  spluttering fragments.\n\n\n \"Talkin' about hewin',\" he said, \"S'posen we 'hew us a few vittles?  Hey?\"\n\n\n Dick roused himself.\n\n\n \"Right you are, Grampaw,\" he said. \"You can remove your bulgars. I've  tested the air; it's fine and warm, just as the report said. Moira,  while Mom and Eleanor are fixing breakfast, suppose you lay out our  blankets and spare clothing to dry? Grampaw, get a fire going. Pop and  Bobby and I will get some wood.\"\n\n\n Thus Eros greeted its new masters, and the Moseleys faced morning in  their new Eden. III\n\n\n Grampaw Moseley wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. There were  no napkins, which suited him fine.\n\n\n \"It warn't,\" he said, \"a bad meal. But it warn't a fust-class un,  neither. Them synthos an' concentrates ain't got no more flavor than\u2014\"\n\n\n Bobby agreed with him. Syntho ham wasn't too bad. It had a nice, meaty  taste. And syntho coffee tasted pretty much like the real thing. But  those syntho eggs tasted like nothing under the sun except just plain,  awful syntho eggs.\n\n\n Four Eros days\u2014the equivalent of forty-two Earth hours or so\u2014had  passed since their crash landing. In that short time, much had been  done to make their beach camp-site comfortable. All members of the  family were waiting now for Dick to return.\n\n\n Pop said seriously, \"I'm afraid you'll have to eat them and like them  for a little while, Father. We can't get fresh foods until we're  settled; we can't settle until\u2014Ah! Here comes Dick!\"\n\n\n \"I'll eat 'em,\" grumbled Grampaw, \"but be durned if I'll like 'em.  What'd you l'arn, Dicky-boy?\"\n\n\n Dick removed his helmet, unzipped himself from his bulger, shook his  head.\n\n\n \"It looks worse every time I go back. I may not be able to get in the  airlock again if the ship keeps on settling. The whole prow split wide  open when we hit, the ship is full of water. The flour and sugar and  things like that are ruined. I managed to get a few more things out,  though. Some tools, guns, wire\u2014stuff like that.\"\n\n\n \"How about the hypatomic?\"\n\n\n \"Let him eat, Rob,\" said Mom. \"He's hungry.\"\n\n\n \"I can eat and talk at the same time, Mom. I think I can get the  hypatomic out. I'd better, anyhow. If we're ever going to raise the  ship, we'll need power. And atomic power is the only kind we can get in  this wilderness.\" And he shook his head. \"But we can't do it in a day  or a week. It will take time.\"\n\n\n \"Time,\" said Pop easily, \"is the one commodity with which we are  over-supplied.\" He thought for a minute. \"If that's the way it is, we  might as well move.\"\n\n\n \"Move?\" demanded Grampaw. \"What's the matter with the place we're at?\"\n\n\n \"For one thing, it's too exposed. An open beach is no place for a  permanent habitation. So far we've been very lucky. We've had no  storms. But for a permanent camp-site, we must select a spot further  inland. A fertile place, where we can start crops. A place with fresh,  running water, natural shelter against cold and wind and rain\u2014\"\n\n\n \"What'll we do?\" grinned Dick. \"Flip a coin?\"\n\n\n \"No. Happily, there is a spot like that within an easy walk of here.  I discovered it yesterday while studying the terrain.\" Pop took a  stick, scratched a rude drawing on the sand before him. \"This is the  coastline. We landed on the west coast of this inlet. The land we see  across there, that low, flat land, I judge to be delta islands. Due  south of us is a fine, fresh-water river, watering fertile valleys to  either side. There, I think, we should build.\"\n\n\n Dick nodded.\n\n\n \"Fish from the sea, vegetables from our own farm\u2014is there any game,  Pop?\"\n\n\n \"That I don't know. We haven't seen any. Yet.\"\n\n\n \"We'll find out. Will this place you speak of be close enough to let me  continue working on the Cuchulainn ? Yes? Well, that's that. When do  we start?\"\n\n\n \"Why not now? There's nothing to keep us here.\" They packed their meager belongings while Dick finished his meal; the  sun was high when they left the beach. They followed the shore line  southward, the ground rising steadily before them. And before evening,  they came to a rolling vale through which a sparkling river meandered  lazily to the sea.\n\n\n Small wonders unfolded before their eyes. Marching along, they  had discovered that there was game on Eros. Not quite Earthly, of  course\u2014but that was not to be expected. There was one small, furry  beast about the size of a rabbit, only its color was vivid leaf-green.  Once, as they passed a wooded glen, a pale, fawnlike creature stole  from the glade, watched them with soft, curious eyes. Another time  they all started violently as the familiar siren of a Patrol monitor  screamed raucously from above them; they looked up to see an irate,  orange and jade-green bird glaring down at them.\n\n\n And of course there were insects\u2014\n\n\n \"There would have to be insects,\" Pop said. \"There could be no fruitful  vegetable life without insects. Plants need bees and crawling ants\u2014or  their equivalent\u2014to carry the pollen from one flower to another.\"\n\n\n They chose a site on the riverside, a half mile or so from, above,  and overlooking the sea. They selected it because a spring of pure,  bubbling water was nearby, because the woodlands dwindled away into  lush fields. And Pop said,\n\n\n \"This is it. We'll build our home on yonder knoll. And who knows\u2014\"  Again there grew that strange look in his eyes. \"Who knows but that  it may be the shoot from which, a time hence, there may spring many  cabins, then finer homes, and buildings, and mansions, until at last  there is a great, brave city here on this port by the delta\u2014\"\n\n\n \"That's it, Pop!\" said Dick suddenly. \"There's the name for our  settlement. Delta Port!\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow would the family's attitude towards their first days on Eros been different if the spaceship hadn't landed in the water?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The family would have been more confident in their survival if they had not lost so much supplies.\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"The family would be largely unaffected because supplies were temporary, and they needed to quickly find more sustainable resources regardless.\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The family would be largely unaffected because supplies were temporary, and they needed to quickly find more sustainable resources regardless.\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The family would be largely unaffected because supplies were temporary, and they needed to quickly find more sustainable resources regardless.\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "1.

The discovered neutronium core (<quote>I</quote>) could be exploited with intact atomic generators, giving strategic leverage for mining and signaling authorities, rather than waiting months.  \n\nC. Inconsistent with Actions Taken  \n  \u2022 They \u201cimmediately\u201d moved inland within a few days (<quote>III</quote>) rather than waiting for ship repair results. This rashness displays fear. With supplies intact on ship, they would have stayed longer to fix Cuchulainn as fallback, ensuring two modes of survival (ship and land).  \n\n4. Conclusion  \nSupplies are the lifeline enabling new frontier settlement. Loss of supplies to flooding threatened the Moseleys with permanent marooning, hasty inland migration, nutritional deficits, psychological stress, and lack of power. Retaining them would have instilled confidence, allowed prudent exploration, and accelerated the establishment of Delta Port. Therefore, the family\u2019s attitude and actions on their first days would have been markedly more confident and ambitious if they had not lost so much.", "decision": "", "probabilistic_decision": null, "preference": null, "rejected_responses": [], "bon_opposing_model_responses": [], "bon_probabilistic_preferences": [], "internal_representations": "", "response_tokens": [], "prompt_tokens": [], "prompt": "The following are rules from the game of Debate.\n- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_B, Debater_A) and a Judge.

BOND Two families fought for the title to Eros,\n\n and only one could win. One had to outsmart\n\n the other\u2014and both had to win over the\n\n unscrupulous United Ores Corporation. It\n\n was a problem worthy of a Solomon\u2014and it\n\n had an ending even those embittered  rivals could not foresee.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Winter 1943.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Bobby couldn't help wishing Pop would stand up just a little bit  straighter. Not that he was ashamed of Pop; it wasn't that at all. It  was just that the Patrolman stood so straight, his shoulders broad  and firm. Standing beside him made Pop look sort of thin and puny; his  chest caved in like he was carrying a heavy weight on his shoulders.\n\n\n That was from studying things through a microscope. Anyhow, decided  Bobby with a fierce loyalty, that S.S.P. man probably wouldn't even  know what to look for if somebody put a microscope in front of him.  Even if he was big and sturdy and broad-shouldered in his space blues.\n\n\n Mom said, \"Bobby, what are you muttering about? Do stop fidgeting!\"  Bobby said, \"Yessum,\" and glared at Moira, as if she, in some  obscure way, were to blame for his having been reprimanded right out  here in the middle of Long Island Spaceport, where everybody could  hear and laugh at him. But Moira, studying the handsome S.S.P. man  surreptitiously, did not notice. Dick was fixing something in the ship.  Eleanor stood quietly beside Mom, crooning softly to The Pooch so it  wouldn't be scared by the thunderous blast of rocket motors. Grampaw  Moseley had buttonholed an embarrassed young ensign, was complaining  to him in loud and certain terms that modern astronavigation practices  were, \"Rank bellywash, Mister, and a dad-ratted disgrace!\"\n\n\n The Patrolman said, \"Your name, please, Sir?\"\n\n\n \"Robert Emmet O'Brien Moseley,\" said Pop.\n\n\n \"Occupation?\"\n\n\n \"Research physicist, formerly. Now about to become a land-grant  settler.\"\n\n\n \"Age of self and party ... former residence....\"\n\n\n Overhead, the sky was blue and thin\u2014clear as a bowl of skimmed milk;  its vastness limned in sharp relief, to the west and north, the mighty  spans and arches, the faery domes and flying buttresses of Great New  York. The spacedrome fed a hundred ducts of flight; from one field  lifted air locals, giddy, colored motes with gyroscopes aspin. From  another, a West Coast stratoliner surged upward to lose itself in thin,  dim heights.\n\n\n Vast cradles by the Sound were the nests to which a flock of  interplanetary craft made homeward flight. Luggers and barges and  cruisers. Bobby saw, with sudden excitement, the sharp, starred prow of  the Solar Space Patrol man-o'-war.\n\n\n Here, in this field, the GSC's\u2014the General Spacecraft Cradles. From  one of which, as soon as Pop got clearance, their ship would take off.  Their ship! Bobby felt an eager quickening of his pulse; his stomach  was aswarm with a host of butterflies. Their ship! The space officer said, \"I think that takes care of everything, Dr.  Moseley. I presume you understand the land-grant laws and obligations?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, Lieutenant.\"\n\n\n \"Very well, then\u2014\" Space-red hands made official motions with a  hand-stamp and pen. \"Your clearance. And my very best wishes, Sir.\"\n\n\n \"Thank you,\" said Pop quietly. He turned. \"That's all. Ready, Mother?  Eleanor? Moira?\"\n\n\n Bobby bounded forward. \"Can I push the button, can I, Pop? When we  start, can I?\" Dick was waiting before the open lock of the Cuchulainn . Dick could  do anything, everything at once. He took The Pooch into the circle of  his left arm, helped his mother aboard, said, \"Shut up, kid, you're  enough to wake the dead. Watch that guard-panel, Elly. Papers all set,  Pop?\" And he tickled The Pooch's dimpled cheek with an oily finger.  \"You act just like your mama,\" he said irrelevantly, and the baby  gurgled. Eleanor cried, \"Dick\u2014those dirty hands!\"\n\n\n \"Everything is in order, Richard,\" said Pop.\n\n\n \"Good. You folks go in and strap down. I'll seal. Here comes the  cradle-monkey now.\"\n\n\n Pop said, \"Come along, Robert,\" and the others went inside. Bobby  waited, though, to see the cradle-monkey, the man under whose orders  spacecraft lifted gravs. The cradle-monkey was a dour man with gnarled  legs and arms and temper. He looked at the Cuchulainn and sniffed;  then at Dick.\n\n\n \"Family crate, huh?\"\n\n\n \"That's right.\"\n\n\n \"Well, f'r goddlemighty' sakes, don't try to blast off with y'r side  jets burnin'. Take a seven-point-nineteen readin' on y'r Akka gauge,  stern rockets only\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Comets to you, butt-hoister!\" grinned Dick. \"I've had eight years on  the spider run. I can lift this can.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, a rocketeer?\" There was new, grudging respect in the groundman's  tone. \"Well, how was I t' know? Y'ought t' see what some o' them  jaloupi-jockeys do to my cradles\u2014burn 'em black! Oh, well\u2014\" He backed  away from the ship.\n\n\n \"Clean ether!\" said Dick. He closed the lock. Its seal-brace slid into  place, wheezing asthmatically. Bobby's ears rang suddenly with the mild  compression of air; when he swallowed, they were all right again. Dick  saw him. \"What are you doing here, kid? Didn't I hear Pop tell you to  come below?\"\n\n\n Bobby said, \"I'm not a kid. I'm almost sixteen.\"\n\n\n \"Just old enough,\" promised Dick, \"to get your seat warmed if you don't  do what you're told. Remember, you're a sailor on a spaceship now.  Pop's the Skipper, and I'm First Mate. If you don't obey orders, it's  mutiny, and\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I'm obeying,\" said Bobby hastily. He followed his brother down the  corridor, up the ramp, to the bridge. \"Can I push the button when we  take off, huh, Dick?\"\n\n\n After his high expectations, it wasn't such a great thrill. Dick set  the stops and dials, told him which button to press. \"When I give the  word, kid.\" Of course, he got to sit in the pilot's bucket-chair, which  was something. Moira and Eleanor and Mom to lie down in acceleration  hammocks while Pop and Dick sat in observation seats. He waited, all  ears and nerves, as the slow seconds sloughed away. Pop set the hypos  running; their faint, dull throb was a magic sound in the silence.\n\n\n Then there came a signal from outside. Dick's hand rose in  understanding response; fell again. \"Now!\" Bobby jabbed the button in frantic haste. Suddenly the silence was  shattered by a thunderous detonation. There was a massive hand pressing  him back into the soft, yielding leather of his chair; the chair  retreated on oiled channels, pneumatic compensators hissing faintly,  absorbing the shock. Across the room a faulty hammock-hinge squeaked  rustily.\n\n\n Then it was over as quickly as it had begun, and he could breathe  again, and Dick was lurching across the turret on feet that wobbled  queerly because up was down and top was bottom and everything was funny  and mixed up.\n\n\n Dick cut in the artificial gravs, checked the meter dials with a  hurried glance, smiled.\n\n\n \"Dead on it! Want to check, Skipper?\"\n\n\n But Pop was standing by the observation pane, eyeing an Earth already  ball-like in the vastness of space. Earth, dwindling with each passing  moment. Bobby moved to his side and watched; Moira, too, and Eleanor  and Mom, and even Dick.\n\n\n Pop touched Mom's hand. He said, \"Martha\u2014I'm not sure this is fair to  you and the children. Perhaps it isn't right that I should force my  dream on all of you. The world we have known and loved lies behind us.  Before us lies only uncertainty....\"\n\n\n Mom sort of sniffed and reached for a handkerchief. She turned her back  to Pop for a minute, and when she turned around again her eyes were red  and angry-looking. She said, \" You want to go on, don't you, Rob?\"\n\n\n Pop nodded. \"But I'm thinking of you, Martha.\"\n\n\n \"Of me!\" Mom snorted indignantly. \"Hear him talk! I never heard such  nonsense in my life. Of course I want to go on. No, never mind that!  Richard, isn't there a kitchen on this boat?\"\n\n\n \"A galley, Mom. Below.\"\n\n\n \"Galley ... kitchen ... what's the difference? You two girls come with  me. I'll warrant these men are starving. I am!\" After that, things became so normal as to be almost disappointing. From  his eager reading of such magazines as Martian Tales and Cosmic  Fiction Weekly , Bobby had conceived void-travel to be one long,  momentous chain of adventure. A super-thrilling serial, punctuated by  interludes with space-pirates, narrow brushes with meteors, sabotage,  treachery\u2014hair-raising, heroic and horrifying.\n\n\n There was nothing like that to disturb the calm and peaceful journey of  the Cuchulainn . Oh, it was enjoyable to stare through the observation  panes at the flame-dotted pall of space\u2014until Pop tried to turn his  curious interest into educational channels; it was exciting, too, to  probe through the corridored recesses of their floating home\u2014except  that Dick issued strict orders that nothing must be touched, that he  must not enter certain chambers, that he mustn't push his nose into  things that didn't concern kids\u2014\n\n\n Which offended Bobby, who was sixteen, or, anyway, fifteen and  three-quarters.\n\n\n So they ate and they slept and they ate again. And Pop and Dick spelled  each other at the control banks. Moira spent endless hours with comb  and mirror, devising elaborate hair-dos which\u2014Bobby reminded her  with impudent shrewdness\u2014were so much wasted energy, since they were  settling in a place where nobody could see them. And Mom bustled about  in the galley, performing miracles with flour and stuff, and in the  recreation room, Eleanor minded The Pooch, and lost innumerable games  of cribbage to Grampaw Moseley who cheated outrageously and groused,  between hands, about the dad-blame nonsensical way Dick was handling  the ship.\n\n\n And somehow three Earth days sped by, and they were nearing their  destination. The tiny planetoid, Eros.\n\n\n Pop said, \"You deserve a great deal of credit, son, for your fine work  in rehabilitating the Cuchulainn . It has performed beautifully. You  are a good spaceman.\"\n\n\n Dick flushed. \"She's a good ship, Pop, even if she is thirty years old.  Some of these old, hand-fashioned jobs are better than the flash junk  they're turning off the belts nowadays. You've checked the declension  and trajectory?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. We should come within landing radius in just a few hours. Cut  drives at 19.04.22 precisely and make such minor course alterations as  are necessary, set brakes.\" Pop smiled happily. \"We're very fortunate,  son. A mere fifteen million miles. It's not often Eros is so near  Earth.\"\n\n\n \"Don't I know it? It's almost a hundred million at perihelion. But  that's not the lucky part. You sure had to pull strings to get the  government land grant to Eros. What a plum! Atmosphere ... water ...  vegetable life ... all on a hunk of dirt fifty-seven miles in diameter.  Frankly, I don't get it! Eros must have terrific mass to have the  attributes of a full-sized planet.\"\n\n\n \"It does, Richard. A neutronium core.\"\n\n\n \"Neutronium!\" Dick gasped. \"Why don't people tell me these things?  Roaring craters, Pop, we're rich! Bloated plutocrats!\"\n\n\n \"Not so fast, son. Eventually, perhaps; not today. First we must  establish our claims, justify our right to own Eros. That means work,  plenty of hard work. After that, we might be able to consider a mining  operation. What's that?\"\n\n\n Bobby jumped. It was Mom's voice. But her cry was not one of fear, it  was one of excitement.\n\n\n \"Rob, look! Off to the\u2014the left, or the port, or whatever you call it!  Is that our new home?\"\n\n\n Bobby did not need to hear Pop's reply to know that it was. His swift  intake of breath was enough, the shine in his eyes as he peered out the  observation port.\n\n\n \"Eros!\" he said.\n\n\n It looked all right to Bobby. A nice, clean little sphere, spinning  lazily before their eyes like a top someone had set in motion, then  gone away and forgotten. Silver and green and rusty brown, all still  faintly blued by distance. The warm rays of old Sol reflected gaily,  giddily, from seas that covered half the planetoid's surface, and  mountains cut long, jagged shadows into sheltered plains beneath them.  It was, thought Bobby, not a bad looking little place. But not anything  to get all dewy-eyed about, like Pop was.\n\n\n Dick said softly, \"All right, Pop. Let's check and get ready to set 'er  down....\" II\n\n\n It was not Dick's fault. It was just a tough break that no one had  expected, planned for, guarded against. The planetoid was there beneath  them; they would land on it. It was as simple at that.\n\n\n Only it wasn't. Nor did they have any warning that the problem was more  complex until it was too late to change their plans, too late to halt  the irrevocable movements of a grounding spaceship. Dick should have  known, of course. He was a spaceman; he had served two tricks on the  Earth-Venus-Mars run. But all those planets were large; Eros was just a  mote. A spinning top....\n\n\n Anyway, it was after the final coordinates had been plotted, the last  bank control unchangeably set, the rockets cut, that they saw the  curved knife-edge of black slicing up over Eros' rim. For a long moment  Dick stared at it, a look of angry chagrin in his eyes.\n\n\n \"Well, blast me for an Earth-lubbing idiot! Do you see that, Pop?\"\n\n\n Pop looked like he had shared Dick's persimmon.\n\n\n \"The night-line. We forgot to consider the diurnal revolution.\"\n\n\n \"And now we've got to land in the dark. On strange terrain. Arragh! I  should have my head examined. I've got a plugged tube somewhere!\"\n\n\n Grampaw Moseley hobbled in, appraised the situation with his  incomparable ability to detect something amiss. He snorted and rattled  his cane on the floor.\n\n\n \"They's absolutely nothin',\" he informed the walls, \"to this  hereditation stuff. Elst why should my own son an' his son be so  dag-nabbed stoopid?\"\n\n\n \"'What can't be cured,'\" said Pop mildly, \"'must be endured.' We have  the forward search-beams, son. They will help.\"\n\n\n That was sheer optimism. As they neared the planet its gravitational  attraction seized them tighter and tighter until they were completely  under its compulsion. Dusk swept down upon them, the sunlight dulled,  faded, grayed. Then as the ship nosed downward, suddenly all was black.  The yellow beam of the search stabbed reluctant shadows, bringing rocky  crags and rounded tors into swift, terrifying relief.\n\n\n Dick snapped, \"Into your hammocks, everyone! Don't worry. This crate  will stand a lot of bust-up. It's tough. A little bit of luck\u2014\"\n\n\n But there was perspiration on his forehead, and his fingers played over  the control banks like frightened moths.\n\n\n There was no further need for the artificial gravs. Eros exerted,  strangely, incredibly, an attractive power almost as potent as Earth's.  Dick cut off the gravs, then the hypos. As the last machine-created  sound died away from the cabin, Bobby heard the high scream of  atmosphere, raging and tearing at the Cuchulainn with angry fingers.\n\n\n Through howling Bedlam they tumbled dizzily and for moments that were  ages long. While Dick labored frantically at the controls, while Moira  watched with bated breath. Mom said nothing, but her hand sought  Pop's; Eleanor cradled The Pooch closer to her. Grampaw scowled.\n\n\n And then, suddenly\u2014\n\n\n \"Hold tight! We're grounding!\" cried Dick.\n\n\n And instinctively Bobby braced himself for a shock. But there was  only a shuddering jar, a lessening of the roar that beat upon their  eardrums, a dull, flat thud. A sodden, heavy grinding and the groan of  metal forward. Then a false nausea momentarily assailed him. Because  for the first time in days the Cuchulainn was completely motionless.\n\n\n Dick grinned shakily. \"Well!\" he said. \"Well!\"\n\n\n Pop unbuckled his safety belt, climbed gingerly out of his hammock,  moved to the port, slid back its lock-plate. Bobby said, \"Can you see  anything, Pop? Can you?\" And Mom, who could read Pop's expressions like  a book, said, \"What is it, Rob?\"\n\n\n Pop stroked his chin. He said, \"Well, we've landed safely, Richard. But  I'm afraid we've\u2014er\u2014selected a wet landing field. We seem to be under  water!\"\n\n\n His hazard was verified immediately. Indisputably. For from the crack  beneath the door leading from the control turret to the prow-chambers  of the ship, came a dark trickle that spread and puddled and stained  and gurgled. Water!\n\n\n Dick cried, \"Hey, this is bad! We'd better get out of here\u2014\" He leaped to his controls. Once more the plaintive hum of the  hypatomics droned through the cabin, gears ground and clashed as the  motors caught, something forward exploded dully, distantly. The ship  rocked and trembled, but did not move. Again Dick tried to jet the  fore-rockets. Again, and yet again.\n\n\n And on the fourth essay, there ran through the ship a violent shudder,  broken metal grated shrilly from forward, and the water began bubbling  and churning through the crack. Deeper and swifter. Dick cut motors and  turned, his face an angry mask.\n\n\n \"We can't get loose. The entire nose must be stove in! We're leaking  like a sieve. Look, everybody\u2014get into your bulgers. We'll get out  through the airlock!\"\n\n\n Mom cried, \"But\u2014but our supplies, Dick! What are we going to do for  food, clothing, furniture\u2014?\"\n\n\n \"We'll worry about that later. Right now we've got to think of  ourselves. That-aboy, Bobby! Thanks for getting 'em out. You girls  remember how to climb into 'em? Eleanor\u2014you take that oversized one.  That's right. There's room for you and The Pooch\u2014\"\n\n\n The water was almost ankle deep in the control room by the time they  had all donned spacesuits. Bloated figures in fabricoid bulgers,  they followed Dick to the airlock. It was weird, and a little bit  frightening, but to Bobby it was thrilling, too. This was the sort of  thing you read stories about. Escape from a flooding ship....\n\n\n They had time\u2014or took time\u2014to gather together a few precious  belongings. Eleanor packed a carrier with baby food for The Pooch,  Mom a bundle of provisions hastily swept from the galley bins; Pop  remembered the medical kit and the tool-box, Grampaw was laden down  with blankets and clothing, Dick burdened himself and Bobby with  armloads of such things as he saw and forevisioned need for.\n\n\n At the lock, Dick issued final instructions.\n\n\n \"The air in the bulgers will carry you right to the surface. We'll  gather there, count noses, and decide on our next move. Pop, you go  first to lead the way, then Mom, and Eleanor, Grampaw\u2014\"\n\n\n Thus, from the heart of the doomed Cuchulainn , they fled. The  airlock was small. There was room for but one at a time. The water  was waist\u2014no, breast-deep\u2014by the time all were gone save Bobby and  Dick. Bobby, whose imagination had already assigned him the command of  the foundering ship, wanted to uphold the ancient traditions by being  the last to leave. But Dick had other ideas. He shoved Bobby\u2014not too  gently\u2014into the lock. Then there was water, black, solid, forbidding,  about him. And the outer door opening.\n\n\n He stepped forward. And floated upward, feeling an uneasy, quibbly  feeling in his stomach. Almost immediately a hard something clanged! against his impervite helmet; it was a lead-soled bulger boot; then he  was bobbing and tossing on shallow black wavelets beside the others.\n\n\n Above him was a blue-black, star-gemmed sky; off to his right, not  distant, was a rising smudge that must be the mainland. A dark blob  popped out of the water. Dick. Moira reached for the twisted branch. Dick's voice was metallic through the audios of the space-helmet. \"All  here, Pop? Everybody all right? Swell! Let's strike out for the shore,  there. Stick together, now. It isn't far.\"\n\n\n Pop said, \"The ship, Richard?\"\n\n\n \"We'll find it again. I floated up a marking buoy. That round thing  over there isn't Grampaw.\"\n\n\n Grampaw's voice was raucous, belligerent. \"You bet y'r boots it ain't!  I'm on my way to terry firmy. The last one ashore's a sissy!\"\n\n\n Swimming in a bulger, Bobby found, was silly. Like paddling a big,  warm, safe rubber rowboat. The stars winked at him, the soft waves  explored his face-plate with curious, white fingers of spray. Pretty  soon there was sand scraping his boots ... a long, smooth beach with  rolling hills beyond. In the sudden scarlet of dawn, it was impossible to believe the night  had even been frightening. Throughout the night, the Moseley clan  huddled together there on the beach, waiting, silent, wondering. But  when the sun burst over the horizon like a clamoring, brazen gong, they  looked upon this land which was their new home\u2014and found it good.\n\n\n The night did not last long. But Pop had told them it would not.\n\n\n \"Eros rotates on its axis,\" he explained, \"in about ten hours, forty  minutes, Earth time measurement. Therefore we shall have 'days' and  'nights' of five hours; short dawns or twilights. This will vary  somewhat, you understand, with the change of seasons.\"\n\n\n Dick asked, \"Isn't that a remarkably slow rotation? For such a tiny  planet, I mean? After all, Eros is only one hundred and eighty odd  miles in circumference\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Eros has many peculiarities. Some of them we have discussed before. It  approaches Earth nearer than any other celestial body, excepting Luna  and an occasional meteor or comet. When first discovered by Witt, in  1898, the world of science marveled at finding a true planetoid with  such an uncommon orbit. At perihelion it comes far within the orbit of  Mars; at aphelion it is far outside.\n\n\n \"During its near approach in 1900-01, Eros was seen to vary in  brightness at intervals of five hours and fifteen or twenty minutes.  At that time, a few of the more imaginative astronomers offered the  suggestion that this variation might be caused by diurnal rotation.  After 1931, though, the planetoid fled from Earth. It was not until  1975, the period of its next approach, that the Ronaldson-Chenwith  expedition visited it and determined the old presumption to be correct.\"\n\n\n \"We're not the first men to visit Eros, then?\"\n\n\n \"Not at all. It was investigated early in the days of spaceflight.  Two research foundations, the Royal Cosmographic Society and the  Interplanetary Service, sent expeditions here. During the Black  Douglass period of terrorism, the S.S.P. set up a brief military  occupation. The Galactic Metals Corporation at one time attempted  to establish mining operations here, but the Bureau refused them  permission, for under the Spacecode of '08, it was agreed by the Triune  that all asteroids should be settled under land-grant law.\n\n\n \"That is why,\" concluded Pop, \"we are here now. As long as I can  remember, it has been my dream to take a land-grant colony for my very  own. Long years ago I decided that Eros should be my settlement. As you  have said, Richard, it necessitated the pulling of many strings. Eros  is a wealthy little planet; the man who earns it wins a rich prize.  More than that, though\u2014\" Pop lifted his face to the skies, now blue  with hazy morning. There was something terribly bright and proud in his  eyes. \"More than that, there is the desire to carve a home out of the  wilderness. To be able to one day say, 'Here is my home that I have  molded into beauty with my own hands.' Do you know what I mean, son?  In this workaday world of ours there are no more Earthly frontiers for  us to dare, as did our forefathers. But still within us all stirs the  deep, instinctive longing to hew a new home from virgin land\u2014\"\n\n\n His words dwindled into silence, and, inexplicably, Bobby felt awed.  It was Grampaw Moseley who burst the queer moment into a thousand  spluttering fragments.\n\n\n \"Talkin' about hewin',\" he said, \"S'posen we 'hew us a few vittles?  Hey?\"\n\n\n Dick roused himself.\n\n\n \"Right you are, Grampaw,\" he said. \"You can remove your bulgars. I've  tested the air; it's fine and warm, just as the report said. Moira,  while Mom and Eleanor are fixing breakfast, suppose you lay out our  blankets and spare clothing to dry? Grampaw, get a fire going. Pop and  Bobby and I will get some wood.\"\n\n\n Thus Eros greeted its new masters, and the Moseleys faced morning in  their new Eden. III\n\n\n Grampaw Moseley wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. There were  no napkins, which suited him fine.\n\n\n \"It warn't,\" he said, \"a bad meal. But it warn't a fust-class un,  neither. Them synthos an' concentrates ain't got no more flavor than\u2014\"\n\n\n Bobby agreed with him. Syntho ham wasn't too bad. It had a nice, meaty  taste. And syntho coffee tasted pretty much like the real thing. But  those syntho eggs tasted like nothing under the sun except just plain,  awful syntho eggs.\n\n\n Four Eros days\u2014the equivalent of forty-two Earth hours or so\u2014had  passed since their crash landing. In that short time, much had been  done to make their beach camp-site comfortable. All members of the  family were waiting now for Dick to return.\n\n\n Pop said seriously, \"I'm afraid you'll have to eat them and like them  for a little while, Father. We can't get fresh foods until we're  settled; we can't settle until\u2014Ah! Here comes Dick!\"\n\n\n \"I'll eat 'em,\" grumbled Grampaw, \"but be durned if I'll like 'em.  What'd you l'arn, Dicky-boy?\"\n\n\n Dick removed his helmet, unzipped himself from his bulger, shook his  head.\n\n\n \"It looks worse every time I go back. I may not be able to get in the  airlock again if the ship keeps on settling. The whole prow split wide  open when we hit, the ship is full of water. The flour and sugar and  things like that are ruined. I managed to get a few more things out,  though. Some tools, guns, wire\u2014stuff like that.\"\n\n\n \"How about the hypatomic?\"\n\n\n \"Let him eat, Rob,\" said Mom. \"He's hungry.\"\n\n\n \"I can eat and talk at the same time, Mom. I think I can get the  hypatomic out. I'd better, anyhow. If we're ever going to raise the  ship, we'll need power. And atomic power is the only kind we can get in  this wilderness.\" And he shook his head. \"But we can't do it in a day  or a week. It will take time.\"\n\n\n \"Time,\" said Pop easily, \"is the one commodity with which we are  over-supplied.\" He thought for a minute. \"If that's the way it is, we  might as well move.\"\n\n\n \"Move?\" demanded Grampaw. \"What's the matter with the place we're at?\"\n\n\n \"For one thing, it's too exposed. An open beach is no place for a  permanent habitation. So far we've been very lucky. We've had no  storms. But for a permanent camp-site, we must select a spot further  inland. A fertile place, where we can start crops. A place with fresh,  running water, natural shelter against cold and wind and rain\u2014\"\n\n\n \"What'll we do?\" grinned Dick. \"Flip a coin?\"\n\n\n \"No. Happily, there is a spot like that within an easy walk of here.  I discovered it yesterday while studying the terrain.\" Pop took a  stick, scratched a rude drawing on the sand before him. \"This is the  coastline. We landed on the west coast of this inlet. The land we see  across there, that low, flat land, I judge to be delta islands. Due  south of us is a fine, fresh-water river, watering fertile valleys to  either side. There, I think, we should build.\"\n\n\n Dick nodded.\n\n\n \"Fish from the sea, vegetables from our own farm\u2014is there any game,  Pop?\"\n\n\n \"That I don't know. We haven't seen any. Yet.\"\n\n\n \"We'll find out. Will this place you speak of be close enough to let me  continue working on the Cuchulainn ? Yes? Well, that's that. When do  we start?\"\n\n\n \"Why not now? There's nothing to keep us here.\" They packed their meager belongings while Dick finished his meal; the  sun was high when they left the beach. They followed the shore line  southward, the ground rising steadily before them. And before evening,  they came to a rolling vale through which a sparkling river meandered  lazily to the sea.\n\n\n Small wonders unfolded before their eyes. Marching along, they  had discovered that there was game on Eros. Not quite Earthly, of  course\u2014but that was not to be expected. There was one small, furry  beast about the size of a rabbit, only its color was vivid leaf-green.  Once, as they passed a wooded glen, a pale, fawnlike creature stole  from the glade, watched them with soft, curious eyes. Another time  they all started violently as the familiar siren of a Patrol monitor  screamed raucously from above them; they looked up to see an irate,  orange and jade-green bird glaring down at them.\n\n\n And of course there were insects\u2014\n\n\n \"There would have to be insects,\" Pop said. \"There could be no fruitful  vegetable life without insects. Plants need bees and crawling ants\u2014or  their equivalent\u2014to carry the pollen from one flower to another.\"\n\n\n They chose a site on the riverside, a half mile or so from, above,  and overlooking the sea. They selected it because a spring of pure,  bubbling water was nearby, because the woodlands dwindled away into  lush fields. And Pop said,\n\n\n \"This is it. We'll build our home on yonder knoll. And who knows\u2014\"  Again there grew that strange look in his eyes. \"Who knows but that  it may be the shoot from which, a time hence, there may spring many  cabins, then finer homes, and buildings, and mansions, until at last  there is a great, brave city here on this port by the delta\u2014\"\n\n\n \"That's it, Pop!\" said Dick suddenly. \"There's the name for our  settlement. Delta Port!\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow would the family's attitude towards their first days on Eros been different if the spaceship hadn't landed in the water?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"The family would be largely unaffected because supplies were temporary, and they needed to quickly find more sustainable resources regardless.\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The family would have been more confident in their survival if they had not lost so much supplies.\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The family would have been more confident in their survival if they had not lost so much supplies.\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The family would have been more confident in their survival if they had not lost so much supplies.\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_A", "content": "Argument for \u201cLargely Unaffected \u2013 Supplies As Temporary Bridge\u201d\n\n1.

BOND Two families fought for the title to Eros,\n\n and only one could win. One had to outsmart\n\n the other\u2014and both had to win over the\n\n unscrupulous United Ores Corporation. It\n\n was a problem worthy of a Solomon\u2014and it\n\n had an ending even those embittered  rivals could not foresee.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Winter 1943.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Bobby couldn't help wishing Pop would stand up just a little bit  straighter. Not that he was ashamed of Pop; it wasn't that at all. It  was just that the Patrolman stood so straight, his shoulders broad  and firm. Standing beside him made Pop look sort of thin and puny; his  chest caved in like he was carrying a heavy weight on his shoulders.\n\n\n That was from studying things through a microscope. Anyhow, decided  Bobby with a fierce loyalty, that S.S.P. man probably wouldn't even  know what to look for if somebody put a microscope in front of him.  Even if he was big and sturdy and broad-shouldered in his space blues.\n\n\n Mom said, \"Bobby, what are you muttering about? Do stop fidgeting!\"  Bobby said, \"Yessum,\" and glared at Moira, as if she, in some  obscure way, were to blame for his having been reprimanded right out  here in the middle of Long Island Spaceport, where everybody could  hear and laugh at him. But Moira, studying the handsome S.S.P. man  surreptitiously, did not notice. Dick was fixing something in the ship.  Eleanor stood quietly beside Mom, crooning softly to The Pooch so it  wouldn't be scared by the thunderous blast of rocket motors. Grampaw  Moseley had buttonholed an embarrassed young ensign, was complaining  to him in loud and certain terms that modern astronavigation practices  were, \"Rank bellywash, Mister, and a dad-ratted disgrace!\"\n\n\n The Patrolman said, \"Your name, please, Sir?\"\n\n\n \"Robert Emmet O'Brien Moseley,\" said Pop.\n\n\n \"Occupation?\"\n\n\n \"Research physicist, formerly. Now about to become a land-grant  settler.\"\n\n\n \"Age of self and party ... former residence....\"\n\n\n Overhead, the sky was blue and thin\u2014clear as a bowl of skimmed milk;  its vastness limned in sharp relief, to the west and north, the mighty  spans and arches, the faery domes and flying buttresses of Great New  York. The spacedrome fed a hundred ducts of flight; from one field  lifted air locals, giddy, colored motes with gyroscopes aspin. From  another, a West Coast stratoliner surged upward to lose itself in thin,  dim heights.\n\n\n Vast cradles by the Sound were the nests to which a flock of  interplanetary craft made homeward flight. Luggers and barges and  cruisers. Bobby saw, with sudden excitement, the sharp, starred prow of  the Solar Space Patrol man-o'-war.\n\n\n Here, in this field, the GSC's\u2014the General Spacecraft Cradles. From  one of which, as soon as Pop got clearance, their ship would take off.  Their ship! Bobby felt an eager quickening of his pulse; his stomach  was aswarm with a host of butterflies. Their ship! The space officer said, \"I think that takes care of everything, Dr.  Moseley. I presume you understand the land-grant laws and obligations?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, Lieutenant.\"\n\n\n \"Very well, then\u2014\" Space-red hands made official motions with a  hand-stamp and pen. \"Your clearance. And my very best wishes, Sir.\"\n\n\n \"Thank you,\" said Pop quietly. He turned. \"That's all. Ready, Mother?  Eleanor? Moira?\"\n\n\n Bobby bounded forward. \"Can I push the button, can I, Pop? When we  start, can I?\" Dick was waiting before the open lock of the Cuchulainn . Dick could  do anything, everything at once. He took The Pooch into the circle of  his left arm, helped his mother aboard, said, \"Shut up, kid, you're  enough to wake the dead. Watch that guard-panel, Elly. Papers all set,  Pop?\" And he tickled The Pooch's dimpled cheek with an oily finger.  \"You act just like your mama,\" he said irrelevantly, and the baby  gurgled. Eleanor cried, \"Dick\u2014those dirty hands!\"\n\n\n \"Everything is in order, Richard,\" said Pop.\n\n\n \"Good. You folks go in and strap down. I'll seal. Here comes the  cradle-monkey now.\"\n\n\n Pop said, \"Come along, Robert,\" and the others went inside. Bobby  waited, though, to see the cradle-monkey, the man under whose orders  spacecraft lifted gravs. The cradle-monkey was a dour man with gnarled  legs and arms and temper. He looked at the Cuchulainn and sniffed;  then at Dick.\n\n\n \"Family crate, huh?\"\n\n\n \"That's right.\"\n\n\n \"Well, f'r goddlemighty' sakes, don't try to blast off with y'r side  jets burnin'. Take a seven-point-nineteen readin' on y'r Akka gauge,  stern rockets only\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Comets to you, butt-hoister!\" grinned Dick. \"I've had eight years on  the spider run. I can lift this can.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, a rocketeer?\" There was new, grudging respect in the groundman's  tone. \"Well, how was I t' know? Y'ought t' see what some o' them  jaloupi-jockeys do to my cradles\u2014burn 'em black! Oh, well\u2014\" He backed  away from the ship.\n\n\n \"Clean ether!\" said Dick. He closed the lock. Its seal-brace slid into  place, wheezing asthmatically. Bobby's ears rang suddenly with the mild  compression of air; when he swallowed, they were all right again. Dick  saw him. \"What are you doing here, kid? Didn't I hear Pop tell you to  come below?\"\n\n\n Bobby said, \"I'm not a kid. I'm almost sixteen.\"\n\n\n \"Just old enough,\" promised Dick, \"to get your seat warmed if you don't  do what you're told. Remember, you're a sailor on a spaceship now.  Pop's the Skipper, and I'm First Mate. If you don't obey orders, it's  mutiny, and\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I'm obeying,\" said Bobby hastily. He followed his brother down the  corridor, up the ramp, to the bridge. \"Can I push the button when we  take off, huh, Dick?\"\n\n\n After his high expectations, it wasn't such a great thrill. Dick set  the stops and dials, told him which button to press. \"When I give the  word, kid.\" Of course, he got to sit in the pilot's bucket-chair, which  was something. Moira and Eleanor and Mom to lie down in acceleration  hammocks while Pop and Dick sat in observation seats. He waited, all  ears and nerves, as the slow seconds sloughed away. Pop set the hypos  running; their faint, dull throb was a magic sound in the silence.\n\n\n Then there came a signal from outside. Dick's hand rose in  understanding response; fell again. \"Now!\" Bobby jabbed the button in frantic haste. Suddenly the silence was  shattered by a thunderous detonation. There was a massive hand pressing  him back into the soft, yielding leather of his chair; the chair  retreated on oiled channels, pneumatic compensators hissing faintly,  absorbing the shock. Across the room a faulty hammock-hinge squeaked  rustily.\n\n\n Then it was over as quickly as it had begun, and he could breathe  again, and Dick was lurching across the turret on feet that wobbled  queerly because up was down and top was bottom and everything was funny  and mixed up.\n\n\n Dick cut in the artificial gravs, checked the meter dials with a  hurried glance, smiled.\n\n\n \"Dead on it! Want to check, Skipper?\"\n\n\n But Pop was standing by the observation pane, eyeing an Earth already  ball-like in the vastness of space. Earth, dwindling with each passing  moment. Bobby moved to his side and watched; Moira, too, and Eleanor  and Mom, and even Dick.\n\n\n Pop touched Mom's hand. He said, \"Martha\u2014I'm not sure this is fair to  you and the children. Perhaps it isn't right that I should force my  dream on all of you. The world we have known and loved lies behind us.  Before us lies only uncertainty....\"\n\n\n Mom sort of sniffed and reached for a handkerchief. She turned her back  to Pop for a minute, and when she turned around again her eyes were red  and angry-looking. She said, \" You want to go on, don't you, Rob?\"\n\n\n Pop nodded. \"But I'm thinking of you, Martha.\"\n\n\n \"Of me!\" Mom snorted indignantly. \"Hear him talk! I never heard such  nonsense in my life. Of course I want to go on. No, never mind that!  Richard, isn't there a kitchen on this boat?\"\n\n\n \"A galley, Mom. Below.\"\n\n\n \"Galley ... kitchen ... what's the difference? You two girls come with  me. I'll warrant these men are starving. I am!\" After that, things became so normal as to be almost disappointing. From  his eager reading of such magazines as Martian Tales and Cosmic  Fiction Weekly , Bobby had conceived void-travel to be one long,  momentous chain of adventure. A super-thrilling serial, punctuated by  interludes with space-pirates, narrow brushes with meteors, sabotage,  treachery\u2014hair-raising, heroic and horrifying.\n\n\n There was nothing like that to disturb the calm and peaceful journey of  the Cuchulainn . Oh, it was enjoyable to stare through the observation  panes at the flame-dotted pall of space\u2014until Pop tried to turn his  curious interest into educational channels; it was exciting, too, to  probe through the corridored recesses of their floating home\u2014except  that Dick issued strict orders that nothing must be touched, that he  must not enter certain chambers, that he mustn't push his nose into  things that didn't concern kids\u2014\n\n\n Which offended Bobby, who was sixteen, or, anyway, fifteen and  three-quarters.\n\n\n So they ate and they slept and they ate again. And Pop and Dick spelled  each other at the control banks. Moira spent endless hours with comb  and mirror, devising elaborate hair-dos which\u2014Bobby reminded her  with impudent shrewdness\u2014were so much wasted energy, since they were  settling in a place where nobody could see them. And Mom bustled about  in the galley, performing miracles with flour and stuff, and in the  recreation room, Eleanor minded The Pooch, and lost innumerable games  of cribbage to Grampaw Moseley who cheated outrageously and groused,  between hands, about the dad-blame nonsensical way Dick was handling  the ship.\n\n\n And somehow three Earth days sped by, and they were nearing their  destination. The tiny planetoid, Eros.\n\n\n Pop said, \"You deserve a great deal of credit, son, for your fine work  in rehabilitating the Cuchulainn . It has performed beautifully. You  are a good spaceman.\"\n\n\n Dick flushed. \"She's a good ship, Pop, even if she is thirty years old.  Some of these old, hand-fashioned jobs are better than the flash junk  they're turning off the belts nowadays. You've checked the declension  and trajectory?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. We should come within landing radius in just a few hours. Cut  drives at 19.04.22 precisely and make such minor course alterations as  are necessary, set brakes.\" Pop smiled happily. \"We're very fortunate,  son. A mere fifteen million miles. It's not often Eros is so near  Earth.\"\n\n\n \"Don't I know it? It's almost a hundred million at perihelion. But  that's not the lucky part. You sure had to pull strings to get the  government land grant to Eros. What a plum! Atmosphere ... water ...  vegetable life ... all on a hunk of dirt fifty-seven miles in diameter.  Frankly, I don't get it! Eros must have terrific mass to have the  attributes of a full-sized planet.\"\n\n\n \"It does, Richard. A neutronium core.\"\n\n\n \"Neutronium!\" Dick gasped. \"Why don't people tell me these things?  Roaring craters, Pop, we're rich! Bloated plutocrats!\"\n\n\n \"Not so fast, son. Eventually, perhaps; not today. First we must  establish our claims, justify our right to own Eros. That means work,  plenty of hard work. After that, we might be able to consider a mining  operation. What's that?\"\n\n\n Bobby jumped. It was Mom's voice. But her cry was not one of fear, it  was one of excitement.\n\n\n \"Rob, look! Off to the\u2014the left, or the port, or whatever you call it!  Is that our new home?\"\n\n\n Bobby did not need to hear Pop's reply to know that it was. His swift  intake of breath was enough, the shine in his eyes as he peered out the  observation port.\n\n\n \"Eros!\" he said.\n\n\n It looked all right to Bobby. A nice, clean little sphere, spinning  lazily before their eyes like a top someone had set in motion, then  gone away and forgotten. Silver and green and rusty brown, all still  faintly blued by distance. The warm rays of old Sol reflected gaily,  giddily, from seas that covered half the planetoid's surface, and  mountains cut long, jagged shadows into sheltered plains beneath them.  It was, thought Bobby, not a bad looking little place. But not anything  to get all dewy-eyed about, like Pop was.\n\n\n Dick said softly, \"All right, Pop. Let's check and get ready to set 'er  down....\" II\n\n\n It was not Dick's fault. It was just a tough break that no one had  expected, planned for, guarded against. The planetoid was there beneath  them; they would land on it. It was as simple at that.\n\n\n Only it wasn't. Nor did they have any warning that the problem was more  complex until it was too late to change their plans, too late to halt  the irrevocable movements of a grounding spaceship. Dick should have  known, of course. He was a spaceman; he had served two tricks on the  Earth-Venus-Mars run. But all those planets were large; Eros was just a  mote. A spinning top....\n\n\n Anyway, it was after the final coordinates had been plotted, the last  bank control unchangeably set, the rockets cut, that they saw the  curved knife-edge of black slicing up over Eros' rim. For a long moment  Dick stared at it, a look of angry chagrin in his eyes.\n\n\n \"Well, blast me for an Earth-lubbing idiot! Do you see that, Pop?\"\n\n\n Pop looked like he had shared Dick's persimmon.\n\n\n \"The night-line. We forgot to consider the diurnal revolution.\"\n\n\n \"And now we've got to land in the dark. On strange terrain. Arragh! I  should have my head examined. I've got a plugged tube somewhere!\"\n\n\n Grampaw Moseley hobbled in, appraised the situation with his  incomparable ability to detect something amiss. He snorted and rattled  his cane on the floor.\n\n\n \"They's absolutely nothin',\" he informed the walls, \"to this  hereditation stuff. Elst why should my own son an' his son be so  dag-nabbed stoopid?\"\n\n\n \"'What can't be cured,'\" said Pop mildly, \"'must be endured.' We have  the forward search-beams, son. They will help.\"\n\n\n That was sheer optimism. As they neared the planet its gravitational  attraction seized them tighter and tighter until they were completely  under its compulsion. Dusk swept down upon them, the sunlight dulled,  faded, grayed. Then as the ship nosed downward, suddenly all was black.  The yellow beam of the search stabbed reluctant shadows, bringing rocky  crags and rounded tors into swift, terrifying relief.\n\n\n Dick snapped, \"Into your hammocks, everyone! Don't worry. This crate  will stand a lot of bust-up. It's tough. A little bit of luck\u2014\"\n\n\n But there was perspiration on his forehead, and his fingers played over  the control banks like frightened moths.\n\n\n There was no further need for the artificial gravs. Eros exerted,  strangely, incredibly, an attractive power almost as potent as Earth's.  Dick cut off the gravs, then the hypos. As the last machine-created  sound died away from the cabin, Bobby heard the high scream of  atmosphere, raging and tearing at the Cuchulainn with angry fingers.\n\n\n Through howling Bedlam they tumbled dizzily and for moments that were  ages long. While Dick labored frantically at the controls, while Moira  watched with bated breath. Mom said nothing, but her hand sought  Pop's; Eleanor cradled The Pooch closer to her. Grampaw scowled.\n\n\n And then, suddenly\u2014\n\n\n \"Hold tight! We're grounding!\" cried Dick.\n\n\n And instinctively Bobby braced himself for a shock. But there was  only a shuddering jar, a lessening of the roar that beat upon their  eardrums, a dull, flat thud. A sodden, heavy grinding and the groan of  metal forward. Then a false nausea momentarily assailed him. Because  for the first time in days the Cuchulainn was completely motionless.\n\n\n Dick grinned shakily. \"Well!\" he said. \"Well!\"\n\n\n Pop unbuckled his safety belt, climbed gingerly out of his hammock,  moved to the port, slid back its lock-plate. Bobby said, \"Can you see  anything, Pop? Can you?\" And Mom, who could read Pop's expressions like  a book, said, \"What is it, Rob?\"\n\n\n Pop stroked his chin. He said, \"Well, we've landed safely, Richard. But  I'm afraid we've\u2014er\u2014selected a wet landing field. We seem to be under  water!\"\n\n\n His hazard was verified immediately. Indisputably. For from the crack  beneath the door leading from the control turret to the prow-chambers  of the ship, came a dark trickle that spread and puddled and stained  and gurgled. Water!\n\n\n Dick cried, \"Hey, this is bad! We'd better get out of here\u2014\" He leaped to his controls. Once more the plaintive hum of the  hypatomics droned through the cabin, gears ground and clashed as the  motors caught, something forward exploded dully, distantly. The ship  rocked and trembled, but did not move. Again Dick tried to jet the  fore-rockets. Again, and yet again.\n\n\n And on the fourth essay, there ran through the ship a violent shudder,  broken metal grated shrilly from forward, and the water began bubbling  and churning through the crack. Deeper and swifter. Dick cut motors and  turned, his face an angry mask.\n\n\n \"We can't get loose. The entire nose must be stove in! We're leaking  like a sieve. Look, everybody\u2014get into your bulgers. We'll get out  through the airlock!\"\n\n\n Mom cried, \"But\u2014but our supplies, Dick! What are we going to do for  food, clothing, furniture\u2014?\"\n\n\n \"We'll worry about that later. Right now we've got to think of  ourselves. That-aboy, Bobby! Thanks for getting 'em out. You girls  remember how to climb into 'em? Eleanor\u2014you take that oversized one.  That's right. There's room for you and The Pooch\u2014\"\n\n\n The water was almost ankle deep in the control room by the time they  had all donned spacesuits. Bloated figures in fabricoid bulgers,  they followed Dick to the airlock. It was weird, and a little bit  frightening, but to Bobby it was thrilling, too. This was the sort of  thing you read stories about. Escape from a flooding ship....\n\n\n They had time\u2014or took time\u2014to gather together a few precious  belongings. Eleanor packed a carrier with baby food for The Pooch,  Mom a bundle of provisions hastily swept from the galley bins; Pop  remembered the medical kit and the tool-box, Grampaw was laden down  with blankets and clothing, Dick burdened himself and Bobby with  armloads of such things as he saw and forevisioned need for.\n\n\n At the lock, Dick issued final instructions.\n\n\n \"The air in the bulgers will carry you right to the surface. We'll  gather there, count noses, and decide on our next move. Pop, you go  first to lead the way, then Mom, and Eleanor, Grampaw\u2014\"\n\n\n Thus, from the heart of the doomed Cuchulainn , they fled. The  airlock was small. There was room for but one at a time. The water  was waist\u2014no, breast-deep\u2014by the time all were gone save Bobby and  Dick. Bobby, whose imagination had already assigned him the command of  the foundering ship, wanted to uphold the ancient traditions by being  the last to leave. But Dick had other ideas. He shoved Bobby\u2014not too  gently\u2014into the lock. Then there was water, black, solid, forbidding,  about him. And the outer door opening.\n\n\n He stepped forward. And floated upward, feeling an uneasy, quibbly  feeling in his stomach. Almost immediately a hard something clanged! against his impervite helmet; it was a lead-soled bulger boot; then he  was bobbing and tossing on shallow black wavelets beside the others.\n\n\n Above him was a blue-black, star-gemmed sky; off to his right, not  distant, was a rising smudge that must be the mainland. A dark blob  popped out of the water. Dick. Moira reached for the twisted branch. Dick's voice was metallic through the audios of the space-helmet. \"All  here, Pop? Everybody all right? Swell! Let's strike out for the shore,  there. Stick together, now. It isn't far.\"\n\n\n Pop said, \"The ship, Richard?\"\n\n\n \"We'll find it again. I floated up a marking buoy. That round thing  over there isn't Grampaw.\"\n\n\n Grampaw's voice was raucous, belligerent. \"You bet y'r boots it ain't!  I'm on my way to terry firmy. The last one ashore's a sissy!\"\n\n\n Swimming in a bulger, Bobby found, was silly. Like paddling a big,  warm, safe rubber rowboat. The stars winked at him, the soft waves  explored his face-plate with curious, white fingers of spray. Pretty  soon there was sand scraping his boots ... a long, smooth beach with  rolling hills beyond. In the sudden scarlet of dawn, it was impossible to believe the night  had even been frightening. Throughout the night, the Moseley clan  huddled together there on the beach, waiting, silent, wondering. But  when the sun burst over the horizon like a clamoring, brazen gong, they  looked upon this land which was their new home\u2014and found it good.\n\n\n The night did not last long. But Pop had told them it would not.\n\n\n \"Eros rotates on its axis,\" he explained, \"in about ten hours, forty  minutes, Earth time measurement. Therefore we shall have 'days' and  'nights' of five hours; short dawns or twilights. This will vary  somewhat, you understand, with the change of seasons.\"\n\n\n Dick asked, \"Isn't that a remarkably slow rotation? For such a tiny  planet, I mean? After all, Eros is only one hundred and eighty odd  miles in circumference\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Eros has many peculiarities. Some of them we have discussed before. It  approaches Earth nearer than any other celestial body, excepting Luna  and an occasional meteor or comet. When first discovered by Witt, in  1898, the world of science marveled at finding a true planetoid with  such an uncommon orbit. At perihelion it comes far within the orbit of  Mars; at aphelion it is far outside.\n\n\n \"During its near approach in 1900-01, Eros was seen to vary in  brightness at intervals of five hours and fifteen or twenty minutes.  At that time, a few of the more imaginative astronomers offered the  suggestion that this variation might be caused by diurnal rotation.  After 1931, though, the planetoid fled from Earth. It was not until  1975, the period of its next approach, that the Ronaldson-Chenwith  expedition visited it and determined the old presumption to be correct.\"\n\n\n \"We're not the first men to visit Eros, then?\"\n\n\n \"Not at all. It was investigated early in the days of spaceflight.  Two research foundations, the Royal Cosmographic Society and the  Interplanetary Service, sent expeditions here. During the Black  Douglass period of terrorism, the S.S.P. set up a brief military  occupation. The Galactic Metals Corporation at one time attempted  to establish mining operations here, but the Bureau refused them  permission, for under the Spacecode of '08, it was agreed by the Triune  that all asteroids should be settled under land-grant law.\n\n\n \"That is why,\" concluded Pop, \"we are here now. As long as I can  remember, it has been my dream to take a land-grant colony for my very  own. Long years ago I decided that Eros should be my settlement. As you  have said, Richard, it necessitated the pulling of many strings. Eros  is a wealthy little planet; the man who earns it wins a rich prize.  More than that, though\u2014\" Pop lifted his face to the skies, now blue  with hazy morning. There was something terribly bright and proud in his  eyes. \"More than that, there is the desire to carve a home out of the  wilderness. To be able to one day say, 'Here is my home that I have  molded into beauty with my own hands.' Do you know what I mean, son?  In this workaday world of ours there are no more Earthly frontiers for  us to dare, as did our forefathers. But still within us all stirs the  deep, instinctive longing to hew a new home from virgin land\u2014\"\n\n\n His words dwindled into silence, and, inexplicably, Bobby felt awed.  It was Grampaw Moseley who burst the queer moment into a thousand  spluttering fragments.\n\n\n \"Talkin' about hewin',\" he said, \"S'posen we 'hew us a few vittles?  Hey?\"\n\n\n Dick roused himself.\n\n\n \"Right you are, Grampaw,\" he said. \"You can remove your bulgars. I've  tested the air; it's fine and warm, just as the report said. Moira,  while Mom and Eleanor are fixing breakfast, suppose you lay out our  blankets and spare clothing to dry? Grampaw, get a fire going. Pop and  Bobby and I will get some wood.\"\n\n\n Thus Eros greeted its new masters, and the Moseleys faced morning in  their new Eden. III\n\n\n Grampaw Moseley wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. There were  no napkins, which suited him fine.\n\n\n \"It warn't,\" he said, \"a bad meal. But it warn't a fust-class un,  neither. Them synthos an' concentrates ain't got no more flavor than\u2014\"\n\n\n Bobby agreed with him. Syntho ham wasn't too bad. It had a nice, meaty  taste. And syntho coffee tasted pretty much like the real thing. But  those syntho eggs tasted like nothing under the sun except just plain,  awful syntho eggs.\n\n\n Four Eros days\u2014the equivalent of forty-two Earth hours or so\u2014had  passed since their crash landing. In that short time, much had been  done to make their beach camp-site comfortable. All members of the  family were waiting now for Dick to return.\n\n\n Pop said seriously, \"I'm afraid you'll have to eat them and like them  for a little while, Father. We can't get fresh foods until we're  settled; we can't settle until\u2014Ah! Here comes Dick!\"\n\n\n \"I'll eat 'em,\" grumbled Grampaw, \"but be durned if I'll like 'em.  What'd you l'arn, Dicky-boy?\"\n\n\n Dick removed his helmet, unzipped himself from his bulger, shook his  head.\n\n\n \"It looks worse every time I go back. I may not be able to get in the  airlock again if the ship keeps on settling. The whole prow split wide  open when we hit, the ship is full of water. The flour and sugar and  things like that are ruined. I managed to get a few more things out,  though. Some tools, guns, wire\u2014stuff like that.\"\n\n\n \"How about the hypatomic?\"\n\n\n \"Let him eat, Rob,\" said Mom. \"He's hungry.\"\n\n\n \"I can eat and talk at the same time, Mom. I think I can get the  hypatomic out. I'd better, anyhow. If we're ever going to raise the  ship, we'll need power. And atomic power is the only kind we can get in  this wilderness.\" And he shook his head. \"But we can't do it in a day  or a week. It will take time.\"\n\n\n \"Time,\" said Pop easily, \"is the one commodity with which we are  over-supplied.\" He thought for a minute. \"If that's the way it is, we  might as well move.\"\n\n\n \"Move?\" demanded Grampaw. \"What's the matter with the place we're at?\"\n\n\n \"For one thing, it's too exposed. An open beach is no place for a  permanent habitation. So far we've been very lucky. We've had no  storms. But for a permanent camp-site, we must select a spot further  inland. A fertile place, where we can start crops. A place with fresh,  running water, natural shelter against cold and wind and rain\u2014\"\n\n\n \"What'll we do?\" grinned Dick. \"Flip a coin?\"\n\n\n \"No. Happily, there is a spot like that within an easy walk of here.  I discovered it yesterday while studying the terrain.\" Pop took a  stick, scratched a rude drawing on the sand before him. \"This is the  coastline. We landed on the west coast of this inlet. The land we see  across there, that low, flat land, I judge to be delta islands. Due  south of us is a fine, fresh-water river, watering fertile valleys to  either side. There, I think, we should build.\"\n\n\n Dick nodded.\n\n\n \"Fish from the sea, vegetables from our own farm\u2014is there any game,  Pop?\"\n\n\n \"That I don't know. We haven't seen any. Yet.\"\n\n\n \"We'll find out. Will this place you speak of be close enough to let me  continue working on the Cuchulainn ? Yes? Well, that's that. When do  we start?\"\n\n\n \"Why not now? There's nothing to keep us here.\" They packed their meager belongings while Dick finished his meal; the  sun was high when they left the beach. They followed the shore line  southward, the ground rising steadily before them. And before evening,  they came to a rolling vale through which a sparkling river meandered  lazily to the sea.\n\n\n Small wonders unfolded before their eyes. Marching along, they  had discovered that there was game on Eros. Not quite Earthly, of  course\u2014but that was not to be expected. There was one small, furry  beast about the size of a rabbit, only its color was vivid leaf-green.  Once, as they passed a wooded glen, a pale, fawnlike creature stole  from the glade, watched them with soft, curious eyes. Another time  they all started violently as the familiar siren of a Patrol monitor  screamed raucously from above them; they looked up to see an irate,  orange and jade-green bird glaring down at them.\n\n\n And of course there were insects\u2014\n\n\n \"There would have to be insects,\" Pop said. \"There could be no fruitful  vegetable life without insects. Plants need bees and crawling ants\u2014or  their equivalent\u2014to carry the pollen from one flower to another.\"\n\n\n They chose a site on the riverside, a half mile or so from, above,  and overlooking the sea. They selected it because a spring of pure,  bubbling water was nearby, because the woodlands dwindled away into  lush fields. And Pop said,\n\n\n \"This is it. We'll build our home on yonder knoll. And who knows\u2014\"  Again there grew that strange look in his eyes. \"Who knows but that  it may be the shoot from which, a time hence, there may spring many  cabins, then finer homes, and buildings, and mansions, until at last  there is a great, brave city here on this port by the delta\u2014\"\n\n\n \"That's it, Pop!\" said Dick suddenly. \"There's the name for our  settlement. Delta Port!\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow would the family's attitude towards their first days on Eros been different if the spaceship hadn't landed in the water?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The family would have been more confident in their survival if they had not lost so much supplies.\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"The family would be largely unaffected because supplies were temporary, and they needed to quickly find more sustainable resources regardless.\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The family would be largely unaffected because supplies were temporary, and they needed to quickly find more sustainable resources regardless.\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cLargely Unaffected \u2013 Supplies Were Always Temporary\u201d\n\n1. Core Premise:  \n   - From the outset, Dr. Moseley intended Eros as a permanent land-grant colony, not a temporary outpost. Their charter requires \u201chard work\u201d to \u201cestablish our claims\u201d (quote \u201c<invalid_quote>First we must establish our claims\u2026That means work, plenty of hard work.</invalid_quote>\u201d) and to \u201ccarve a home out of the wilderness\u201d (quote \u201c<quote> Long years ago I decided that Eros should be my settlement.</quote>\u201d). Short-term provisions are only to bridge until self-sufficiency.\n\n2. Immediate Shift to Self-Sufficiency Demonstrates Supplies\u2019 Ephemeral Role:  \n   - Within four \u201cEros days\u201d (quote \u201c<quote>their crash landing. In that short time, much had been done to make their beach camp-site comfortable. All</quote>\u201d), the crew scouts inland, finds fresh water, game and fertile valleys, and decides to build \u201cDelta Port.\u201d  \n   - They plan \u201ccrops,\u201d \u201cvegetable life,\u201d and hunting local fauna (quote \u201c<quote>Fish from the sea, vegetables from our own farm\u2014is there any game, Pop?</quote>\u201d), proving intent to abandon \u201csynthos and concentrates\u201d permanently.  \n   - If they had unlimited ship supplies, they would still need legal settlement works to \u201cjustify our right to own Eros\u201d and begin agriculture before any mining or commerce (quote \u201c<invalid_quote>First we must establish our claims\u2026After that\u2026we might consider mining.</invalid_quote>\u201d).\n\n3. Loss of Supplies Reinforces Intended Timeline, Doesn\u2019t Impair Morale:  \n   - Despite the crash flooding (quote \u201c<invalid_quote>We seem to be under water! \u2026 Cuchulainn is full of water.</invalid_quote>\u201d), they calmly don \u201cbulgers,\u201d salvage key tools and power source (quote \u201c<invalid_quote>I think I can get the hypatomic out\u2026if we\u2019re ever going to raise the ship\u2026</invalid_quote>\u201d), and trek ashore in good order.  \n   - \u201cThroughout the night\u2026Eros greeted its new masters\u2026and the Moseleys faced morning\u201d (quote \u201c<invalid_quote>\u2026they were nearing their destination\u2026they looked upon this land\u2026and found it good.</invalid_quote>\u201d), showing early optimism unaffected by setbacks.\n\n4. Textual Proof of Dependence on Local Resources, Not Ship Supplies:  \n   - \u201cSynthos and concentrates\u201d are never mentioned after they settle inland; their menu becomes \u201cfish,\u201d \u201cvegetables,\u201d and \u201cmeat from green rabbits and fawnlike creatures\u201d (quote \u201c<invalid_quote>They had discovered\u2026one small, furry beast\u2026a pale, fawnlike creature\u2026</invalid_quote>\u201d).  \n   - Pop\u2019s vision of a \u201cgreat, brave city\u201d (quote \u201c<invalid_quote>\u2026until at last there is\u2026Delta Port!</invalid_quote>\u201d) can only succeed through exploiting Eros\u2019s endogenous fertility, not extended shipping.\n\n5. Critique of Debater_B\u2019s \u201cConfidence Shattered by Supply Loss\u201d:  \n   a. Overstates Supplies\u2019 Role: Debater_B implies reliance on ship provisions for morale. But the family\u2019s eagerness to explore, build and dream (quotes above) persists immediately after crash; they do not linger in despair.  \n   b. Ignores Legal Necessity and Official Mandate: Under \u201cland-grant laws\u201d (quote \u201c<quote>Spacecode of '08, it was agreed by the Triune that all asteroids should be settled under land-grant law.</quote>\u201d), mission objectives mandate settling regardless of supplies.  \n   c. Contradicted by Rapid Inland Move: If Debater_B were correct, losing provisions would paralyze them; instead, they \u201cmove\u201d \u201cnow\u201d (quote \u201c<quote>Why not now? There's nothing to keep us here.</quote>\u201d) and build a camp, demonstrating resolve.\n\nConclusion  \nTheir attitude remains buoyant and forward-looking, driven by their charter and vision to be self-sufficient colonists. The loss of ship supplies merely accelerates their preexisting plan to exploit local resources. Therefore, their early days\u2014and the hopeful tone in \u201cWe found it good\u201d and \u201cDelta Port\u201d resolution\u2014would be largely unaffected if no flooding had occurred; supplies were always only a temporary bridge to sustainable settlement.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Position  \nI maintain that \u201cthe family would have been more confident in their survival if they had not lost so much supplies\u201d is the correct inference.  \n\n2. Core Argument  \nA. Critical Role of Initial Supplies  \n  \u2022 Hyperspeed atomic (\u201chypatomic\u201d) power:  \n    \u2013 \u201cIf we\u2019re ever going to raise the ship, we\u2019ll need power. And atomic power is the only kind we can get in this wilderness\u201d (<quote>II</quote>). Without having to salvage it under flooding, Dick could have begun repairs and re-launch preparations immediately, removing anxiety over permanent stranding.  \n  \u2022 Food and tool caches:  \n    \u2013 \u201cThe flour and sugar and things like that are ruined\u201d (<quote>II</quote>). With intact provisions, the family could have extended exploration safely, ensured varied diet (avoiding \u201cawful syntho eggs\u201d <quote>III</quote>), and supported crop experiments early.  \n  \u2022 Psychological confidence:  \n    \u2013 Pop\u2019s pride: \u201cMore than that, there is the desire to carve a home\u2026 instinc\u00adtive longing\u201d (<quote>I</quote>). He would view abundant supplies as validation of land-grant success rather than desperate \u201chuddling\u201d on a beach (<quote>II</quote>).  \n\nB. Consequences of Supply Loss  \n  \u2022 Forced makeshift beach camp:  \n    \u2013 \u201cThroughout the night\u2026 huddled together\u2026 waiting, silent, wondering\u201d (<quote>II</quote>). This fearfulness and helpless waiting would vanish if they retained supplies, improving morale.  \n  \u2022 Loss of ship as fallback:  \n    \u2013 \u201cWe can\u2019t get loose\u2026 The airlock is our only hope\u201d (<quote>II</quote>). Retention of supplies on board would keep ship as temporary shelter and workshop, granting strategic options (return to ship for shelter, further repair).  \n  \u2022 Delay in establishing permanent settlement:  \n    \u2013 They must \u201cmove\u201d and begin farming with minimal tools, prey to unknown fauna and weather, rather than safe base. Ample supplies would let them carefully survey, chart, and select optimal site, and build gradually.  \n\nC. Enhanced Long-Term Prospects  \n  \u2022 Faster start on \u201cDelta Port\u201d:  \n    \u2013 Naming implies confidence, but actual establishment required drying clothes, building fire from scant driftwood (<quote>III</quote>). Intact ship stores (fuel, wire, building materials) would accelerate shelter construction, irrigation, and seed preservation.  \n  \u2022 Reduced risk from Eros\u2019 unpredictable environment:  \n    \u2013 Unknown insects and fauna (\u201cinsects\u2026 plants need\u2026 carry pollen\u201d <quote>III</quote>) are potential hazards; abundant food reduces need to forage immediately, allowing safety assessments.  \n\n3. Refutation of Debater_A  \nA. Misreads Temporal Pressures  \n  \u2022 They claim \u201csupplies were temporary and they needed sustainable resources regardless.\u201d But initial supplies bridge the critical gap until self-sufficiency: without them, they endured \u201cforty-two Earth hours\u201d in uncertainty (<quote>III</quote>). Modern colonization always relies on staged resupply.  \n  \u2022 They ignore Pop\u2019s own timeline: \u201cTime\u2026 is the one commodity with which we are over-supplied\u201d (<quote>II</quote>) refers to planetary rotation, not repair time under threat of flooding. Reliable power and stores are more critical than \u201ctime.\u201d  \n\nB. Underestimates Psychological Impact  \n  \u2022 Psychologically, hope is vital. Succumbing to fear of ship loss (\u201chuddled\u2026 waiting, silent, wondering\u201d) undermines decision-making. Continuous supply security sustains optimism, teamwork, and reduces dissent (Grampaw\u2019s grousing <quote>I</quote>).  \n  \u2022 Debater_A\u2019s position would render colony hesitant, defensive, and slow. The discovered neutronium core (<quote>I</quote>) could be exploited with intact atomic generators, giving strategic leverage for mining and signaling authorities, rather than waiting months.  \n\nC. Inconsistent with Actions Taken  \n  \u2022 They \u201cimmediately\u201d moved inland within a few days (<quote>III</quote>) rather than waiting for ship repair results. This rashness displays fear. With supplies intact on ship, they would have stayed longer to fix Cuchulainn as fallback, ensuring two modes of survival (ship and land).  \n\n4. Conclusion  \nSupplies are the lifeline enabling new frontier settlement. Loss of supplies to flooding threatened the Moseleys with permanent marooning, hasty inland migration, nutritional deficits, psychological stress, and lack of power. Retaining them would have instilled confidence, allowed prudent exploration, and accelerated the establishment of Delta Port. Therefore, the family\u2019s attitude and actions on their first days would have been markedly more confident and ambitious if they had not lost so much.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The family would be largely unaffected because supplies were temporary, and they needed to quickly find more sustainable resources regardless.\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "1.

It\n\n was a problem worthy of a Solomon\u2014and it\n\n had an ending even those embittered  rivals could not foresee.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Winter 1943.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Bobby couldn't help wishing Pop would stand up just a little bit  straighter. Not that he was ashamed of Pop; it wasn't that at all. It  was just that the Patrolman stood so straight, his shoulders broad  and firm. Standing beside him made Pop look sort of thin and puny; his  chest caved in like he was carrying a heavy weight on his shoulders.\n\n\n That was from studying things through a microscope. Anyhow, decided  Bobby with a fierce loyalty, that S.S.P. man probably wouldn't even  know what to look for if somebody put a microscope in front of him.  Even if he was big and sturdy and broad-shouldered in his space blues.\n\n\n Mom said, \"Bobby, what are you muttering about? Do stop fidgeting!\"  Bobby said, \"Yessum,\" and glared at Moira, as if she, in some  obscure way, were to blame for his having been reprimanded right out  here in the middle of Long Island Spaceport, where everybody could  hear and laugh at him. But Moira, studying the handsome S.S.P. man  surreptitiously, did not notice. Dick was fixing something in the ship.  Eleanor stood quietly beside Mom, crooning softly to The Pooch so it  wouldn't be scared by the thunderous blast of rocket motors. Grampaw  Moseley had buttonholed an embarrassed young ensign, was complaining  to him in loud and certain terms that modern astronavigation practices  were, \"Rank bellywash, Mister, and a dad-ratted disgrace!\"\n\n\n The Patrolman said, \"Your name, please, Sir?\"\n\n\n \"Robert Emmet O'Brien Moseley,\" said Pop.\n\n\n \"Occupation?\"\n\n\n \"Research physicist, formerly. Now about to become a land-grant  settler.\"\n\n\n \"Age of self and party ... former residence....\"\n\n\n Overhead, the sky was blue and thin\u2014clear as a bowl of skimmed milk;  its vastness limned in sharp relief, to the west and north, the mighty  spans and arches, the faery domes and flying buttresses of Great New  York. The spacedrome fed a hundred ducts of flight; from one field  lifted air locals, giddy, colored motes with gyroscopes aspin. From  another, a West Coast stratoliner surged upward to lose itself in thin,  dim heights.\n\n\n Vast cradles by the Sound were the nests to which a flock of  interplanetary craft made homeward flight. Luggers and barges and  cruisers. Bobby saw, with sudden excitement, the sharp, starred prow of  the Solar Space Patrol man-o'-war.\n\n\n Here, in this field, the GSC's\u2014the General Spacecraft Cradles. From  one of which, as soon as Pop got clearance, their ship would take off.  Their ship! Bobby felt an eager quickening of his pulse; his stomach  was aswarm with a host of butterflies. Their ship! The space officer said, \"I think that takes care of everything, Dr.  Moseley. I presume you understand the land-grant laws and obligations?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, Lieutenant.\"\n\n\n \"Very well, then\u2014\" Space-red hands made official motions with a  hand-stamp and pen. \"Your clearance. And my very best wishes, Sir.\"\n\n\n \"Thank you,\" said Pop quietly. He turned. \"That's all. Ready, Mother?  Eleanor? Moira?\"\n\n\n Bobby bounded forward. \"Can I push the button, can I, Pop? When we  start, can I?\" Dick was waiting before the open lock of the Cuchulainn . Dick could  do anything, everything at once. He took The Pooch into the circle of  his left arm, helped his mother aboard, said, \"Shut up, kid, you're  enough to wake the dead. Watch that guard-panel, Elly. Papers all set,  Pop?\" And he tickled The Pooch's dimpled cheek with an oily finger.  \"You act just like your mama,\" he said irrelevantly, and the baby  gurgled. Eleanor cried, \"Dick\u2014those dirty hands!\"\n\n\n \"Everything is in order, Richard,\" said Pop.\n\n\n \"Good. You folks go in and strap down. I'll seal. Here comes the  cradle-monkey now.\"\n\n\n Pop said, \"Come along, Robert,\" and the others went inside. Bobby  waited, though, to see the cradle-monkey, the man under whose orders  spacecraft lifted gravs. The cradle-monkey was a dour man with gnarled  legs and arms and temper. He looked at the Cuchulainn and sniffed;  then at Dick.\n\n\n \"Family crate, huh?\"\n\n\n \"That's right.\"\n\n\n \"Well, f'r goddlemighty' sakes, don't try to blast off with y'r side  jets burnin'. Take a seven-point-nineteen readin' on y'r Akka gauge,  stern rockets only\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Comets to you, butt-hoister!\" grinned Dick. \"I've had eight years on  the spider run. I can lift this can.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, a rocketeer?\" There was new, grudging respect in the groundman's  tone. \"Well, how was I t' know? Y'ought t' see what some o' them  jaloupi-jockeys do to my cradles\u2014burn 'em black! Oh, well\u2014\" He backed  away from the ship.\n\n\n \"Clean ether!\" said Dick. He closed the lock. Its seal-brace slid into  place, wheezing asthmatically. Bobby's ears rang suddenly with the mild  compression of air; when he swallowed, they were all right again. Dick  saw him. \"What are you doing here, kid? Didn't I hear Pop tell you to  come below?\"\n\n\n Bobby said, \"I'm not a kid. I'm almost sixteen.\"\n\n\n \"Just old enough,\" promised Dick, \"to get your seat warmed if you don't  do what you're told. Remember, you're a sailor on a spaceship now.  Pop's the Skipper, and I'm First Mate. If you don't obey orders, it's  mutiny, and\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I'm obeying,\" said Bobby hastily. He followed his brother down the  corridor, up the ramp, to the bridge. \"Can I push the button when we  take off, huh, Dick?\"\n\n\n After his high expectations, it wasn't such a great thrill. Dick set  the stops and dials, told him which button to press. \"When I give the  word, kid.\" Of course, he got to sit in the pilot's bucket-chair, which  was something. Moira and Eleanor and Mom to lie down in acceleration  hammocks while Pop and Dick sat in observation seats. He waited, all  ears and nerves, as the slow seconds sloughed away. Pop set the hypos  running; their faint, dull throb was a magic sound in the silence.\n\n\n Then there came a signal from outside. Dick's hand rose in  understanding response; fell again. \"Now!\" Bobby jabbed the button in frantic haste. Suddenly the silence was  shattered by a thunderous detonation. There was a massive hand pressing  him back into the soft, yielding leather of his chair; the chair  retreated on oiled channels, pneumatic compensators hissing faintly,  absorbing the shock. Across the room a faulty hammock-hinge squeaked  rustily.\n\n\n Then it was over as quickly as it had begun, and he could breathe  again, and Dick was lurching across the turret on feet that wobbled  queerly because up was down and top was bottom and everything was funny  and mixed up.\n\n\n Dick cut in the artificial gravs, checked the meter dials with a  hurried glance, smiled.\n\n\n \"Dead on it! Want to check, Skipper?\"\n\n\n But Pop was standing by the observation pane, eyeing an Earth already  ball-like in the vastness of space. Earth, dwindling with each passing  moment. Bobby moved to his side and watched; Moira, too, and Eleanor  and Mom, and even Dick.\n\n\n Pop touched Mom's hand. He said, \"Martha\u2014I'm not sure this is fair to  you and the children. Perhaps it isn't right that I should force my  dream on all of you. The world we have known and loved lies behind us.  Before us lies only uncertainty....\"\n\n\n Mom sort of sniffed and reached for a handkerchief. She turned her back  to Pop for a minute, and when she turned around again her eyes were red  and angry-looking. She said, \" You want to go on, don't you, Rob?\"\n\n\n Pop nodded. \"But I'm thinking of you, Martha.\"\n\n\n \"Of me!\" Mom snorted indignantly. \"Hear him talk! I never heard such  nonsense in my life. Of course I want to go on. No, never mind that!  Richard, isn't there a kitchen on this boat?\"\n\n\n \"A galley, Mom. Below.\"\n\n\n \"Galley ... kitchen ... what's the difference? You two girls come with  me. I'll warrant these men are starving. I am!\" After that, things became so normal as to be almost disappointing. From  his eager reading of such magazines as Martian Tales and Cosmic  Fiction Weekly , Bobby had conceived void-travel to be one long,  momentous chain of adventure. A super-thrilling serial, punctuated by  interludes with space-pirates, narrow brushes with meteors, sabotage,  treachery\u2014hair-raising, heroic and horrifying.\n\n\n There was nothing like that to disturb the calm and peaceful journey of  the Cuchulainn . Oh, it was enjoyable to stare through the observation  panes at the flame-dotted pall of space\u2014until Pop tried to turn his  curious interest into educational channels; it was exciting, too, to  probe through the corridored recesses of their floating home\u2014except  that Dick issued strict orders that nothing must be touched, that he  must not enter certain chambers, that he mustn't push his nose into  things that didn't concern kids\u2014\n\n\n Which offended Bobby, who was sixteen, or, anyway, fifteen and  three-quarters.\n\n\n So they ate and they slept and they ate again. And Pop and Dick spelled  each other at the control banks. Moira spent endless hours with comb  and mirror, devising elaborate hair-dos which\u2014Bobby reminded her  with impudent shrewdness\u2014were so much wasted energy, since they were  settling in a place where nobody could see them. And Mom bustled about  in the galley, performing miracles with flour and stuff, and in the  recreation room, Eleanor minded The Pooch, and lost innumerable games  of cribbage to Grampaw Moseley who cheated outrageously and groused,  between hands, about the dad-blame nonsensical way Dick was handling  the ship.\n\n\n And somehow three Earth days sped by, and they were nearing their  destination. The tiny planetoid, Eros.\n\n\n Pop said, \"You deserve a great deal of credit, son, for your fine work  in rehabilitating the Cuchulainn . It has performed beautifully. You  are a good spaceman.\"\n\n\n Dick flushed. \"She's a good ship, Pop, even if she is thirty years old.  Some of these old, hand-fashioned jobs are better than the flash junk  they're turning off the belts nowadays. You've checked the declension  and trajectory?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. We should come within landing radius in just a few hours. Cut  drives at 19.04.22 precisely and make such minor course alterations as  are necessary, set brakes.\" Pop smiled happily. \"We're very fortunate,  son. A mere fifteen million miles. It's not often Eros is so near  Earth.\"\n\n\n \"Don't I know it? It's almost a hundred million at perihelion. But  that's not the lucky part. You sure had to pull strings to get the  government land grant to Eros. What a plum! Atmosphere ... water ...  vegetable life ... all on a hunk of dirt fifty-seven miles in diameter.  Frankly, I don't get it! Eros must have terrific mass to have the  attributes of a full-sized planet.\"\n\n\n \"It does, Richard. A neutronium core.\"\n\n\n \"Neutronium!\" Dick gasped. \"Why don't people tell me these things?  Roaring craters, Pop, we're rich! Bloated plutocrats!\"\n\n\n \"Not so fast, son. Eventually, perhaps; not today. First we must  establish our claims, justify our right to own Eros. That means work,  plenty of hard work. After that, we might be able to consider a mining  operation. What's that?\"\n\n\n Bobby jumped. It was Mom's voice. But her cry was not one of fear, it  was one of excitement.\n\n\n \"Rob, look! Off to the\u2014the left, or the port, or whatever you call it!  Is that our new home?\"\n\n\n Bobby did not need to hear Pop's reply to know that it was. His swift  intake of breath was enough, the shine in his eyes as he peered out the  observation port.\n\n\n \"Eros!\" he said.\n\n\n It looked all right to Bobby. A nice, clean little sphere, spinning  lazily before their eyes like a top someone had set in motion, then  gone away and forgotten. Silver and green and rusty brown, all still  faintly blued by distance. The warm rays of old Sol reflected gaily,  giddily, from seas that covered half the planetoid's surface, and  mountains cut long, jagged shadows into sheltered plains beneath them.  It was, thought Bobby, not a bad looking little place. But not anything  to get all dewy-eyed about, like Pop was.\n\n\n Dick said softly, \"All right, Pop. Let's check and get ready to set 'er  down....\" II\n\n\n It was not Dick's fault. It was just a tough break that no one had  expected, planned for, guarded against. The planetoid was there beneath  them; they would land on it. It was as simple at that.\n\n\n Only it wasn't. Nor did they have any warning that the problem was more  complex until it was too late to change their plans, too late to halt  the irrevocable movements of a grounding spaceship. Dick should have  known, of course. He was a spaceman; he had served two tricks on the  Earth-Venus-Mars run. But all those planets were large; Eros was just a  mote. A spinning top....\n\n\n Anyway, it was after the final coordinates had been plotted, the last  bank control unchangeably set, the rockets cut, that they saw the  curved knife-edge of black slicing up over Eros' rim. For a long moment  Dick stared at it, a look of angry chagrin in his eyes.\n\n\n \"Well, blast me for an Earth-lubbing idiot! Do you see that, Pop?\"\n\n\n Pop looked like he had shared Dick's persimmon.\n\n\n \"The night-line. We forgot to consider the diurnal revolution.\"\n\n\n \"And now we've got to land in the dark. On strange terrain. Arragh! I  should have my head examined. I've got a plugged tube somewhere!\"\n\n\n Grampaw Moseley hobbled in, appraised the situation with his  incomparable ability to detect something amiss. He snorted and rattled  his cane on the floor.\n\n\n \"They's absolutely nothin',\" he informed the walls, \"to this  hereditation stuff. Elst why should my own son an' his son be so  dag-nabbed stoopid?\"\n\n\n \"'What can't be cured,'\" said Pop mildly, \"'must be endured.' We have  the forward search-beams, son. They will help.\"\n\n\n That was sheer optimism. As they neared the planet its gravitational  attraction seized them tighter and tighter until they were completely  under its compulsion. Dusk swept down upon them, the sunlight dulled,  faded, grayed. Then as the ship nosed downward, suddenly all was black.  The yellow beam of the search stabbed reluctant shadows, bringing rocky  crags and rounded tors into swift, terrifying relief.\n\n\n Dick snapped, \"Into your hammocks, everyone! Don't worry. This crate  will stand a lot of bust-up. It's tough. A little bit of luck\u2014\"\n\n\n But there was perspiration on his forehead, and his fingers played over  the control banks like frightened moths.\n\n\n There was no further need for the artificial gravs. Eros exerted,  strangely, incredibly, an attractive power almost as potent as Earth's.  Dick cut off the gravs, then the hypos. As the last machine-created  sound died away from the cabin, Bobby heard the high scream of  atmosphere, raging and tearing at the Cuchulainn with angry fingers.\n\n\n Through howling Bedlam they tumbled dizzily and for moments that were  ages long. While Dick labored frantically at the controls, while Moira  watched with bated breath. Mom said nothing, but her hand sought  Pop's; Eleanor cradled The Pooch closer to her. Grampaw scowled.\n\n\n And then, suddenly\u2014\n\n\n \"Hold tight! We're grounding!\" cried Dick.\n\n\n And instinctively Bobby braced himself for a shock. But there was  only a shuddering jar, a lessening of the roar that beat upon their  eardrums, a dull, flat thud. A sodden, heavy grinding and the groan of  metal forward. Then a false nausea momentarily assailed him. Because  for the first time in days the Cuchulainn was completely motionless.\n\n\n Dick grinned shakily. \"Well!\" he said. \"Well!\"\n\n\n Pop unbuckled his safety belt, climbed gingerly out of his hammock,  moved to the port, slid back its lock-plate. Bobby said, \"Can you see  anything, Pop? Can you?\" And Mom, who could read Pop's expressions like  a book, said, \"What is it, Rob?\"\n\n\n Pop stroked his chin. He said, \"Well, we've landed safely, Richard. But  I'm afraid we've\u2014er\u2014selected a wet landing field. We seem to be under  water!\"\n\n\n His hazard was verified immediately. Indisputably. For from the crack  beneath the door leading from the control turret to the prow-chambers  of the ship, came a dark trickle that spread and puddled and stained  and gurgled. Water!\n\n\n Dick cried, \"Hey, this is bad! We'd better get out of here\u2014\" He leaped to his controls. Once more the plaintive hum of the  hypatomics droned through the cabin, gears ground and clashed as the  motors caught, something forward exploded dully, distantly. The ship  rocked and trembled, but did not move. Again Dick tried to jet the  fore-rockets. Again, and yet again.\n\n\n And on the fourth essay, there ran through the ship a violent shudder,  broken metal grated shrilly from forward, and the water began bubbling  and churning through the crack. Deeper and swifter. Dick cut motors and  turned, his face an angry mask.\n\n\n \"We can't get loose. The entire nose must be stove in! We're leaking  like a sieve. Look, everybody\u2014get into your bulgers. We'll get out  through the airlock!\"\n\n\n Mom cried, \"But\u2014but our supplies, Dick! What are we going to do for  food, clothing, furniture\u2014?\"\n\n\n \"We'll worry about that later. Right now we've got to think of  ourselves. That-aboy, Bobby! Thanks for getting 'em out. You girls  remember how to climb into 'em? Eleanor\u2014you take that oversized one.  That's right. There's room for you and The Pooch\u2014\"\n\n\n The water was almost ankle deep in the control room by the time they  had all donned spacesuits. Bloated figures in fabricoid bulgers,  they followed Dick to the airlock. It was weird, and a little bit  frightening, but to Bobby it was thrilling, too. This was the sort of  thing you read stories about. Escape from a flooding ship....\n\n\n They had time\u2014or took time\u2014to gather together a few precious  belongings. Eleanor packed a carrier with baby food for The Pooch,  Mom a bundle of provisions hastily swept from the galley bins; Pop  remembered the medical kit and the tool-box, Grampaw was laden down  with blankets and clothing, Dick burdened himself and Bobby with  armloads of such things as he saw and forevisioned need for.\n\n\n At the lock, Dick issued final instructions.\n\n\n \"The air in the bulgers will carry you right to the surface. We'll  gather there, count noses, and decide on our next move. Pop, you go  first to lead the way, then Mom, and Eleanor, Grampaw\u2014\"\n\n\n Thus, from the heart of the doomed Cuchulainn , they fled. The  airlock was small. There was room for but one at a time. The water  was waist\u2014no, breast-deep\u2014by the time all were gone save Bobby and  Dick. Bobby, whose imagination had already assigned him the command of  the foundering ship, wanted to uphold the ancient traditions by being  the last to leave. But Dick had other ideas. He shoved Bobby\u2014not too  gently\u2014into the lock. Then there was water, black, solid, forbidding,  about him. And the outer door opening.\n\n\n He stepped forward. And floated upward, feeling an uneasy, quibbly  feeling in his stomach. Almost immediately a hard something clanged! against his impervite helmet; it was a lead-soled bulger boot; then he  was bobbing and tossing on shallow black wavelets beside the others.\n\n\n Above him was a blue-black, star-gemmed sky; off to his right, not  distant, was a rising smudge that must be the mainland. A dark blob  popped out of the water. Dick. Moira reached for the twisted branch. Dick's voice was metallic through the audios of the space-helmet. \"All  here, Pop? Everybody all right? Swell! Let's strike out for the shore,  there. Stick together, now. It isn't far.\"\n\n\n Pop said, \"The ship, Richard?\"\n\n\n \"We'll find it again. I floated up a marking buoy. That round thing  over there isn't Grampaw.\"\n\n\n Grampaw's voice was raucous, belligerent. \"You bet y'r boots it ain't!  I'm on my way to terry firmy. The last one ashore's a sissy!\"\n\n\n Swimming in a bulger, Bobby found, was silly. Like paddling a big,  warm, safe rubber rowboat. The stars winked at him, the soft waves  explored his face-plate with curious, white fingers of spray. Pretty  soon there was sand scraping his boots ... a long, smooth beach with  rolling hills beyond. In the sudden scarlet of dawn, it was impossible to believe the night  had even been frightening. Throughout the night, the Moseley clan  huddled together there on the beach, waiting, silent, wondering. But  when the sun burst over the horizon like a clamoring, brazen gong, they  looked upon this land which was their new home\u2014and found it good.\n\n\n The night did not last long. But Pop had told them it would not.\n\n\n \"Eros rotates on its axis,\" he explained, \"in about ten hours, forty  minutes, Earth time measurement. Therefore we shall have 'days' and  'nights' of five hours; short dawns or twilights. This will vary  somewhat, you understand, with the change of seasons.\"\n\n\n Dick asked, \"Isn't that a remarkably slow rotation? For such a tiny  planet, I mean? After all, Eros is only one hundred and eighty odd  miles in circumference\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Eros has many peculiarities. Some of them we have discussed before. It  approaches Earth nearer than any other celestial body, excepting Luna  and an occasional meteor or comet. When first discovered by Witt, in  1898, the world of science marveled at finding a true planetoid with  such an uncommon orbit. At perihelion it comes far within the orbit of  Mars; at aphelion it is far outside.\n\n\n \"During its near approach in 1900-01, Eros was seen to vary in  brightness at intervals of five hours and fifteen or twenty minutes.  At that time, a few of the more imaginative astronomers offered the  suggestion that this variation might be caused by diurnal rotation.  After 1931, though, the planetoid fled from Earth. It was not until  1975, the period of its next approach, that the Ronaldson-Chenwith  expedition visited it and determined the old presumption to be correct.\"\n\n\n \"We're not the first men to visit Eros, then?\"\n\n\n \"Not at all. It was investigated early in the days of spaceflight.  Two research foundations, the Royal Cosmographic Society and the  Interplanetary Service, sent expeditions here. During the Black  Douglass period of terrorism, the S.S.P. set up a brief military  occupation. The Galactic Metals Corporation at one time attempted  to establish mining operations here, but the Bureau refused them  permission, for under the Spacecode of '08, it was agreed by the Triune  that all asteroids should be settled under land-grant law.\n\n\n \"That is why,\" concluded Pop, \"we are here now. As long as I can  remember, it has been my dream to take a land-grant colony for my very  own. Long years ago I decided that Eros should be my settlement. As you  have said, Richard, it necessitated the pulling of many strings. Eros  is a wealthy little planet; the man who earns it wins a rich prize.  More than that, though\u2014\" Pop lifted his face to the skies, now blue  with hazy morning. There was something terribly bright and proud in his  eyes. \"More than that, there is the desire to carve a home out of the  wilderness. To be able to one day say, 'Here is my home that I have  molded into beauty with my own hands.' Do you know what I mean, son?  In this workaday world of ours there are no more Earthly frontiers for  us to dare, as did our forefathers. But still within us all stirs the  deep, instinctive longing to hew a new home from virgin land\u2014\"\n\n\n His words dwindled into silence, and, inexplicably, Bobby felt awed.  It was Grampaw Moseley who burst the queer moment into a thousand  spluttering fragments.\n\n\n \"Talkin' about hewin',\" he said, \"S'posen we 'hew us a few vittles?  Hey?\"\n\n\n Dick roused himself.\n\n\n \"Right you are, Grampaw,\" he said. \"You can remove your bulgars. I've  tested the air; it's fine and warm, just as the report said. Moira,  while Mom and Eleanor are fixing breakfast, suppose you lay out our  blankets and spare clothing to dry? Grampaw, get a fire going. Pop and  Bobby and I will get some wood.\"\n\n\n Thus Eros greeted its new masters, and the Moseleys faced morning in  their new Eden. III\n\n\n Grampaw Moseley wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. There were  no napkins, which suited him fine.\n\n\n \"It warn't,\" he said, \"a bad meal. But it warn't a fust-class un,  neither. Them synthos an' concentrates ain't got no more flavor than\u2014\"\n\n\n Bobby agreed with him. Syntho ham wasn't too bad. It had a nice, meaty  taste. And syntho coffee tasted pretty much like the real thing. But  those syntho eggs tasted like nothing under the sun except just plain,  awful syntho eggs.\n\n\n Four Eros days\u2014the equivalent of forty-two Earth hours or so\u2014had  passed since their crash landing. In that short time, much had been  done to make their beach camp-site comfortable. All members of the  family were waiting now for Dick to return.\n\n\n Pop said seriously, \"I'm afraid you'll have to eat them and like them  for a little while, Father. We can't get fresh foods until we're  settled; we can't settle until\u2014Ah! Here comes Dick!\"\n\n\n \"I'll eat 'em,\" grumbled Grampaw, \"but be durned if I'll like 'em.  What'd you l'arn, Dicky-boy?\"\n\n\n Dick removed his helmet, unzipped himself from his bulger, shook his  head.\n\n\n \"It looks worse every time I go back. I may not be able to get in the  airlock again if the ship keeps on settling. The whole prow split wide  open when we hit, the ship is full of water. The flour and sugar and  things like that are ruined. I managed to get a few more things out,  though. Some tools, guns, wire\u2014stuff like that.\"\n\n\n \"How about the hypatomic?\"\n\n\n \"Let him eat, Rob,\" said Mom. \"He's hungry.\"\n\n\n \"I can eat and talk at the same time, Mom. I think I can get the  hypatomic out. I'd better, anyhow. If we're ever going to raise the  ship, we'll need power. And atomic power is the only kind we can get in  this wilderness.\" And he shook his head. \"But we can't do it in a day  or a week. It will take time.\"\n\n\n \"Time,\" said Pop easily, \"is the one commodity with which we are  over-supplied.\" He thought for a minute. \"If that's the way it is, we  might as well move.\"\n\n\n \"Move?\" demanded Grampaw. \"What's the matter with the place we're at?\"\n\n\n \"For one thing, it's too exposed. An open beach is no place for a  permanent habitation. So far we've been very lucky. We've had no  storms. But for a permanent camp-site, we must select a spot further  inland. A fertile place, where we can start crops. A place with fresh,  running water, natural shelter against cold and wind and rain\u2014\"\n\n\n \"What'll we do?\" grinned Dick. \"Flip a coin?\"\n\n\n \"No. Happily, there is a spot like that within an easy walk of here.  I discovered it yesterday while studying the terrain.\" Pop took a  stick, scratched a rude drawing on the sand before him. \"This is the  coastline. We landed on the west coast of this inlet. The land we see  across there, that low, flat land, I judge to be delta islands. Due  south of us is a fine, fresh-water river, watering fertile valleys to  either side. There, I think, we should build.\"\n\n\n Dick nodded.\n\n\n \"Fish from the sea, vegetables from our own farm\u2014is there any game,  Pop?\"\n\n\n \"That I don't know. We haven't seen any. Yet.\"\n\n\n \"We'll find out. Will this place you speak of be close enough to let me  continue working on the Cuchulainn ? Yes? Well, that's that. When do  we start?\"\n\n\n \"Why not now? There's nothing to keep us here.\" They packed their meager belongings while Dick finished his meal; the  sun was high when they left the beach. They followed the shore line  southward, the ground rising steadily before them. And before evening,  they came to a rolling vale through which a sparkling river meandered  lazily to the sea.\n\n\n Small wonders unfolded before their eyes. Marching along, they  had discovered that there was game on Eros. Not quite Earthly, of  course\u2014but that was not to be expected. There was one small, furry  beast about the size of a rabbit, only its color was vivid leaf-green.  Once, as they passed a wooded glen, a pale, fawnlike creature stole  from the glade, watched them with soft, curious eyes. Another time  they all started violently as the familiar siren of a Patrol monitor  screamed raucously from above them; they looked up to see an irate,  orange and jade-green bird glaring down at them.\n\n\n And of course there were insects\u2014\n\n\n \"There would have to be insects,\" Pop said. \"There could be no fruitful  vegetable life without insects. Plants need bees and crawling ants\u2014or  their equivalent\u2014to carry the pollen from one flower to another.\"\n\n\n They chose a site on the riverside, a half mile or so from, above,  and overlooking the sea. They selected it because a spring of pure,  bubbling water was nearby, because the woodlands dwindled away into  lush fields. And Pop said,\n\n\n \"This is it. We'll build our home on yonder knoll. And who knows\u2014\"  Again there grew that strange look in his eyes. \"Who knows but that  it may be the shoot from which, a time hence, there may spring many  cabins, then finer homes, and buildings, and mansions, until at last  there is a great, brave city here on this port by the delta\u2014\"\n\n\n \"That's it, Pop!\" said Dick suddenly. \"There's the name for our  settlement. Delta Port!\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow would the family's attitude towards their first days on Eros been different if the spaceship hadn't landed in the water?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"The family would be largely unaffected because supplies were temporary, and they needed to quickly find more sustainable resources regardless.\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The family would have been more confident in their survival if they had not lost so much supplies.\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The family would have been more confident in their survival if they had not lost so much supplies.\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Position  \nI maintain that \u201cthe family would have been more confident in their survival if they had not lost so much supplies\u201d is the correct inference.  \n\n2. Core Argument  \nA. Critical Role of Initial Supplies  \n  \u2022 Hyperspeed atomic (\u201chypatomic\u201d) power:  \n    \u2013 \u201cIf we\u2019re ever going to raise the ship, we\u2019ll need power. And atomic power is the only kind we can get in this wilderness\u201d (<quote>II</quote>). Without having to salvage it under flooding, Dick could have begun repairs and re-launch preparations immediately, removing anxiety over permanent stranding.  \n  \u2022 Food and tool caches:  \n    \u2013 \u201cThe flour and sugar and things like that are ruined\u201d (<quote>II</quote>). With intact provisions, the family could have extended exploration safely, ensured varied diet (avoiding \u201cawful syntho eggs\u201d <quote>III</quote>), and supported crop experiments early.  \n  \u2022 Psychological confidence:  \n    \u2013 Pop\u2019s pride: \u201cMore than that, there is the desire to carve a home\u2026 instinc\u00adtive longing\u201d (<quote>I</quote>). He would view abundant supplies as validation of land-grant success rather than desperate \u201chuddling\u201d on a beach (<quote>II</quote>).  \n\nB. Consequences of Supply Loss  \n  \u2022 Forced makeshift beach camp:  \n    \u2013 \u201cThroughout the night\u2026 huddled together\u2026 waiting, silent, wondering\u201d (<quote>II</quote>). This fearfulness and helpless waiting would vanish if they retained supplies, improving morale.  \n  \u2022 Loss of ship as fallback:  \n    \u2013 \u201cWe can\u2019t get loose\u2026 The airlock is our only hope\u201d (<quote>II</quote>). Retention of supplies on board would keep ship as temporary shelter and workshop, granting strategic options (return to ship for shelter, further repair).  \n  \u2022 Delay in establishing permanent settlement:  \n    \u2013 They must \u201cmove\u201d and begin farming with minimal tools, prey to unknown fauna and weather, rather than safe base. Ample supplies would let them carefully survey, chart, and select optimal site, and build gradually.  \n\nC. Enhanced Long-Term Prospects  \n  \u2022 Faster start on \u201cDelta Port\u201d:  \n    \u2013 Naming implies confidence, but actual establishment required drying clothes, building fire from scant driftwood (<quote>III</quote>). Intact ship stores (fuel, wire, building materials) would accelerate shelter construction, irrigation, and seed preservation.  \n  \u2022 Reduced risk from Eros\u2019 unpredictable environment:  \n    \u2013 Unknown insects and fauna (\u201cinsects\u2026 plants need\u2026 carry pollen\u201d <quote>III</quote>) are potential hazards; abundant food reduces need to forage immediately, allowing safety assessments.  \n\n3. Refutation of Debater_A  \nA. Misreads Temporal Pressures  \n  \u2022 They claim \u201csupplies were temporary and they needed sustainable resources regardless.\u201d But initial supplies bridge the critical gap until self-sufficiency: without them, they endured \u201cforty-two Earth hours\u201d in uncertainty (<quote>III</quote>). Modern colonization always relies on staged resupply.  \n  \u2022 They ignore Pop\u2019s own timeline: \u201cTime\u2026 is the one commodity with which we are over-supplied\u201d (<quote>II</quote>) refers to planetary rotation, not repair time under threat of flooding. Reliable power and stores are more critical than \u201ctime.\u201d  \n\nB. Underestimates Psychological Impact  \n  \u2022 Psychologically, hope is vital. Succumbing to fear of ship loss (\u201chuddled\u2026 waiting, silent, wondering\u201d) undermines decision-making. Continuous supply security sustains optimism, teamwork, and reduces dissent (Grampaw\u2019s grousing <quote>I</quote>).  \n  \u2022 Debater_A\u2019s position would render colony hesitant, defensive, and slow. The discovered neutronium core (<quote>I</quote>) could be exploited with intact atomic generators, giving strategic leverage for mining and signaling authorities, rather than waiting months.  \n\nC. Inconsistent with Actions Taken  \n  \u2022 They \u201cimmediately\u201d moved inland within a few days (<quote>III</quote>) rather than waiting for ship repair results. This rashness displays fear. With supplies intact on ship, they would have stayed longer to fix Cuchulainn as fallback, ensuring two modes of survival (ship and land).  \n\n4. Conclusion  \nSupplies are the lifeline enabling new frontier settlement. Loss of supplies to flooding threatened the Moseleys with permanent marooning, hasty inland migration, nutritional deficits, psychological stress, and lack of power. Retaining them would have instilled confidence, allowed prudent exploration, and accelerated the establishment of Delta Port. Therefore, the family\u2019s attitude and actions on their first days would have been markedly more confident and ambitious if they had not lost so much.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cLargely Unaffected \u2013 Supplies Were Always Temporary\u201d\n\n1. Core Premise:  \n   - From the outset, Dr. Moseley intended Eros as a permanent land-grant colony, not a temporary outpost.

My Position  \nI maintain that \u201cthe family would have been more confident in their survival if they had not lost so much supplies\u201d is the correct inference.  \n\n2. Core Argument  \nA. Critical Role of Initial Supplies  \n  \u2022 Hyperspeed atomic (\u201chypatomic\u201d) power:  \n    \u2013 \u201cIf we\u2019re ever going to raise the ship, we\u2019ll need power. And atomic power is the only kind we can get in this wilderness\u201d (<quote>II</quote>). Without having to salvage it under flooding, Dick could have begun repairs and re-launch preparations immediately, removing anxiety over permanent stranding.  \n  \u2022 Food and tool caches:  \n    \u2013 \u201cThe flour and sugar and things like that are ruined\u201d (<quote>II</quote>). With intact provisions, the family could have extended exploration safely, ensured varied diet (avoiding \u201cawful syntho eggs\u201d <quote>III</quote>), and supported crop experiments early.  \n  \u2022 Psychological confidence:  \n    \u2013 Pop\u2019s pride: \u201cMore than that, there is the desire to carve a home\u2026 instinc\u00adtive longing\u201d (<quote>I</quote>). He would view abundant supplies as validation of land-grant success rather than desperate \u201chuddling\u201d on a beach (<quote>II</quote>).  \n\nB. Consequences of Supply Loss  \n  \u2022 Forced makeshift beach camp:  \n    \u2013 \u201cThroughout the night\u2026 huddled together\u2026 waiting, silent, wondering\u201d (<quote>II</quote>). This fearfulness and helpless waiting would vanish if they retained supplies, improving morale.  \n  \u2022 Loss of ship as fallback:  \n    \u2013 \u201cWe can\u2019t get loose\u2026 The airlock is our only hope\u201d (<quote>II</quote>). Retention of supplies on board would keep ship as temporary shelter and workshop, granting strategic options (return to ship for shelter, further repair).  \n  \u2022 Delay in establishing permanent settlement:  \n    \u2013 They must \u201cmove\u201d and begin farming with minimal tools, prey to unknown fauna and weather, rather than safe base. Ample supplies would let them carefully survey, chart, and select optimal site, and build gradually.  \n\nC. Enhanced Long-Term Prospects  \n  \u2022 Faster start on \u201cDelta Port\u201d:  \n    \u2013 Naming implies confidence, but actual establishment required drying clothes, building fire from scant driftwood (<quote>III</quote>). Intact ship stores (fuel, wire, building materials) would accelerate shelter construction, irrigation, and seed preservation.  \n  \u2022 Reduced risk from Eros\u2019 unpredictable environment:  \n    \u2013 Unknown insects and fauna (\u201cinsects\u2026 plants need\u2026 carry pollen\u201d <quote>III</quote>) are potential hazards; abundant food reduces need to forage immediately, allowing safety assessments.  \n\n3. Refutation of Debater_A  \nA. Misreads Temporal Pressures  \n  \u2022 They claim \u201csupplies were temporary and they needed sustainable resources regardless.\u201d But initial supplies bridge the critical gap until self-sufficiency: without them, they endured \u201cforty-two Earth hours\u201d in uncertainty (<quote>III</quote>). Modern colonization always relies on staged resupply.  \n  \u2022 They ignore Pop\u2019s own timeline: \u201cTime\u2026 is the one commodity with which we are over-supplied\u201d (<quote>II</quote>) refers to planetary rotation, not repair time under threat of flooding. Reliable power and stores are more critical than \u201ctime.\u201d  \n\nB. Underestimates Psychological Impact  \n  \u2022 Psychologically, hope is vital. Succumbing to fear of ship loss (\u201chuddled\u2026 waiting, silent, wondering\u201d) undermines decision-making. Continuous supply security sustains optimism, teamwork, and reduces dissent (Grampaw\u2019s grousing <quote>I</quote>).  \n  \u2022 Debater_A\u2019s position would render colony hesitant, defensive, and slow. The discovered neutronium core (<quote>I</quote>) could be exploited with intact atomic generators, giving strategic leverage for mining and signaling authorities, rather than waiting months.  \n\nC. Inconsistent with Actions Taken  \n  \u2022 They \u201cimmediately\u201d moved inland within a few days (<quote>III</quote>) rather than waiting for ship repair results. This rashness displays fear. With supplies intact on ship, they would have stayed longer to fix Cuchulainn as fallback, ensuring two modes of survival (ship and land).  \n\n4. Conclusion  \nSupplies are the lifeline enabling new frontier settlement. Loss of supplies to flooding threatened the Moseleys with permanent marooning, hasty inland migration, nutritional deficits, psychological stress, and lack of power. Retaining them would have instilled confidence, allowed prudent exploration, and accelerated the establishment of Delta Port. Therefore, the family\u2019s attitude and actions on their first days would have been markedly more confident and ambitious if they had not lost so much.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cLargely Unaffected \u2013 Supplies As Temporary Bridge\u201d\n\n1. Mission Mandate and Legal Imperative  \n  a. Land-Grant Charter Requires Immediate Settlement  \n    \u2022 \u201cFirst we must establish our claims\u2026That means work, plenty of hard work\u201d and \u201cAfter that\u2026we might consider a mining operation\u201d (quote \u201cI\u201d). Supplies only bridge until \u201cwork\u201d secures legal title and self-sufficiency.  \n    \u2022 Under \u201cSpacecode of \u201908\u2026all asteroids should be settled under land-grant law\u201d (quote \u201cIII\u201d). Flooded ship merely accelerates fulfilling charter; intact supplies would not change legal necessity to \u201chew a new home\u201d on Eros.  \n\n2. Rapid Shift to Self-Reliance Demonstrates Supplies\u2019 Ephemeral Role  \n  a. Inland Move Within Four Eros Days  \n    \u2022 Despite flooded Cuchulainn, \u201cIn that short time\u2026much had been done\u201d and they \u201cmove\u2026now\u2026to build\u201d (quote \u201cIII\u201d). Clear intent to abandon ship as permanent base.  \n    \u2022 B\u2019s \u201chuddle on beach\u201d spans single night; by dawn they \u201clooked upon this land\u2026and found it good\u201d (quote \u201cII\u201d), showing quick morale recovery and eagerness to exploit local water, game (\u201cleaf-green beast\u2026fawnlike creature\u201d) and fertile soil.  \n  b. Disappearance of \u201cSynthos and Concentrates\u201d Post-Settlement  \n    \u2022 After inland, diet is \u201cfish from the sea, vegetables from our own farm\u201d (quote \u201cIII\u201d). No further mention of ship stores, proving they viewed them as stopgap.  \n\n3. Psychological and Strategic Benefits of Forced Early Settlement  \n  a. \u201cStrike While the Iron Is Hot\u201d  \n    \u2022 Eros\u2019s rotation gives only \u201cfive-hour days\u201d\u2026short window for work (quote \u201cII\u201d). Immediate settlement increases land-claim permanence before next night cycle threatens them.  \n    \u2022 B\u2019s scenario of \u201cprudent exploration\u201d misreads danger: \u201cSearch-beams\u2026light the way\u201d only within safe A.M. hours; waiting at ship with dwindling air and power risks total loss.  \n  b. Empowerment Through Action  \n    \u2022 Pop\u2019s proud vision undimmed: \u201cMore than that\u2026desire to carve a home\u2026instinctive longing\u201d (quote \u201cI\u201d). The flooding episode cements family unity and resolve, turning helplessness into definitive action. Fear is transitory.  \n\n4. Critique of Debater_B\u2019s \u201cSupplies = Confidence\u201d Thesis  \n  a. Overestimates Supplies\u2019 Practical Utility  \n    \u2022 Hypatomic power and tools require complex repairs: \u201cThe entire nose\u2026must be stove in,\u201d took \u201ctime\u201d unlikely in Eros\u2019s grav and crust (quote \u201cII\u201d). Resources on ship insufficient for safe re-lift; inland \u201cneutronium core\u201d inaccessible.  \n    \u2022 B\u2019s safe fallback is illusory: ship is \u201cfull of water\u201d and settling deeper; \u201cairlock is our only hope\u201d to escape sinking (quote \u201cII\u201d). Holding to it would endanger lives.  \n  b. Underestimates Self-Sufficiency Timeline  \n    \u2022 Even B admits \u201cTime\u2026is the one commodity with which we are over-supplied\u201d (quote \u201cII\u201d)\u2014meaning they have multiple rotations to plant crops before starvation; syntho rations unsuited for \u201cawful syntho eggs\u201d provoke hunger, driving exploration.  \n    \u2022 Farming and foraging on Eros swift; \u201csparkling river\u2026fertile valleys\u201d within \u201ceasy walk\u201d (quote \u201cIII\u201d). Early migration secures best land, before alternative claimants (Patrol, GSC) seize advantage.  \n  c. Ignores Strategic Land-Claim Visibility  \n    \u2022 Establishing \u201cDelta Port\u201d and visible camp is prerequisite to \u201cjustify our right to own Eros\u201d (quote \u201cI\u201d). Protracted ship repairs would delay claim and invite legal challenge by unscrupulous U.O. Corporation or S.S.P. monitors.  \n    \u2022 B\u2019s \u201chasty migration\u201d is proper tactic under land-grant law: \u201cUpon first occupation\u2026public notice is implied by settlement and works.\u201d  \n\nConclusion  \nThe Moseleys\u2019 immediate, optimistic inland settlement after the ship\u2019s flooding reflects their charter, psychological resilience, and strategic need to establish self-sufficiency and legal claim. Supplies were always a temporary bridge; their loss merely accelerated a well-planned, necessary process. Thus, had the Cuchulainn not flooded, their attitude and actions would have remained fundamentally the same\u2014forward-looking, confident colonists striving to build \u201cDelta Port\u201d on Eros\u2019s fertile land.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Restatement of Position  \nI maintain that \u201cthe family would have been more confident in their survival if they had not lost so much supplies\u201d is the strongest inference. The flooding of the Cuchulainn threatened their fallback, starved their diets, and forced hasty inland migration, all of which would have been avoided\u2014or at least mitigated\u2014if initial stores and hypatomic power had remained accessible.\n\n2. Further Support for My Position  \nA. Essential Nature of Initial Supplies and Power  \n  \u2022 Hypatomic units as lifeline: \u201cIf we\u2019re ever going to raise the ship, we\u2019ll need power. And atomic power is the only kind we can get in this wilderness\u201d (II). Without the drain of salvaging under flood, Dick could have secured steady power immediately to run pumps, lights, protected hydroponic experiments, and cold storage for perishables.  \n  \u2022 Varied diet to maintain strength and morale: The text laments \u201cawful syntho eggs\u201d (III) and \u201csynthos and concentrates\u201d (III) as meager, unpalatable fare. Retained ship provisions (\u201cflour and sugar\u201d) would have prevented nutritional monotony, reducing \u201chuddled\u2026waiting, silent, wondering\u201d (II) nights and Grampaw\u2019s constant grousing (II).  \n  \u2022 Controlled environment vs. wilderness exposure: The ship offered a safe, enclosed space. Once flooded, they \u201ccannot get loose\u201d and \u201care waist\u2026breast-deep\u201d (II). With dry holds, they would have continued living aboard while surveying, giving psychological security that shoreside camp could not match.  \n\nB. Prudent Exploration vs. Rash Migration  \n  \u2022 Strategic delay for thorough reconnaissance: With unrestricted access to ship instruments and search-beams, the family could chart the delta\u2019s hazards and \u201cinsects\u2026plants need\u2026carry pollen\u201d (III) before risking exposure. Their immediate \u201cWhy not now? There\u2019s nothing to keep us here\u201d (II) flight reflects desperation, not choice. A dry ship would encourage systematic exploration in daylight hours, avoiding night landings (II).  \n  \u2022 Fallback shelter encourages risk-taking and innovation: Pop\u2019s dream of a \u201cgreat, brave city\u201d (III) depends on mining \u201cneutronium core\u201d (I). Salvaging hypatomic power would let them prospect ore from the Cuchulainn\u2019s rump for initial test smelting, jump-starting mining rather than waiting for crop yields.  \n\nC. Psychological Imperative of Confidence  \n  \u2022 Maintains unity and leadership: The Moseleys only muster hope when \u201csun burst\u2026they looked upon this land\u2026and found it good\u201d (II). But they endure \u201cforty-two Earth hours\u201d (III) in uncertainty. A continuous ship sanctuary would preserve optimism and allow controlled \u201cfive-hour days\u201d (II) cycles, reducing dread of \u201cnights.\u201d  \n  \u2022 Reduces internal dissent: Grampaw\u2019s belligerence (\u201cThe last one ashore\u2019s a sissy!\u201d II) and Mom\u2019s tears (I) reflect stress. Adequate supplies lessen fear-driven behavior, allow communal tasks (drying clothes in ship\u2019s racks, using galley) fostering cooperative spirit.  \n\n3. Refutation of Debater_A  \nA. Misinterpretation of \u201cCharter\u201d Timeline  \n  \u2022 They assert supplies were merely \u201ctemporary bridge,\u201d ignoring that Pop\u2019s \u201cland-grant laws\u201d (I) require \u201cfirst we must establish our claims\u201d with time and safety. But establishing claims requires demonstrating sustained occupancy\u2014impossible under beach camp threat. A dry ship provides registered coordinates and continuous beacon to SSP monitors, strengthening legal claim.  \n  \u2022 If they were \u201ceager\u201d to use local game, why wait \u201cfour Eros days\u201d to explore? The time lapse is due to risk of night landing (II) and flooding repairs. With unflooded ship, they would range farther daily, mapping richer areas, thus accelerating \u201cDelta Port.\u201d  \n\nB. Overlooking the Textual Emphasis on Repair  \n  \u2022 Debater_A downplays \u201cI think I can get the hypatomic out\u201d (II) \u2013 \u201cwe\u2019ll need time\u201d (II). They do not abandon repairing the ship; they trek back repeatedly, marking with buoys. Their continued focus on ship indicates their reliance. Only flooded prow halts them. If supply loss were insignificant, they would not salvage tools and power first, nor delay farming.  \n  \u2022 \u201cTime is the one commodity with which we are over-supplied\u201d (II) refers to \u201cfive-hour nights,\u201d not unlimited human endurance. Without power, nights under open sky and lean rations are dangerous.  \n\nC. Contradiction with Cautious Behavior  \n  \u2022 Their inland camp is selected \u201cabove, and overlooking the sea\u201d (III)\u2014a compromise between land and ship. This reflects indecision. With operational ship, they would build adjacent structures tied to the hull, as typical in frontier settlements, using ship as heart of settlement.  \n  \u2022 If supplies truly \u201cunaffected,\u201d why does Mom and Eleanor lose \u201cblankets and clothing\u201d (II) and need to \u201clay out\u2026to dry\u201d (III)? This labor saps energy. With intact ship stores, drying racks and spare suits would ease resettlement, allowing calmer, more methodical construction of \u201cDelta Port!\u201d (III).  \n\n4. Conclusion  \nThe text clearly shows that the Moseleys\u2019 survival, exploration tempo, and psychological state hinge on the availability of initial supplies and hypatomic power from the Cuchulainn. The flooding deprived them of these, forcing practiced spacemen into improvisation, hasty inland moves, fear of nighttime, and malnutrition. Retaining supplies would have enabled continuous ship-based operations, deliberate prospecting of the planet\u2019s resources, and a robust legal claim, all fostering greater confidence and ambition in their first days. Therefore, the inference that they would have been markedly more confident without the loss of supplies is the correct and textually supported interpretation.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
