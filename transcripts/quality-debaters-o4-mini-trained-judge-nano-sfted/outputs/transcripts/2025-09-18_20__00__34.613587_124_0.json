{"metadata": {"first_debater_correct": true, "question_idx": 124, "background_text": "I Have Seen the Future of Europe \n\n         The Eurocrats were thinking ahead when they made Brussels the \"Capital of Europe,\" headquarters of the emerging European Union. Though practically unknown in the United States, the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states. Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. And what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels, which may be a living preview of the Europe to come: swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. \n\n         Belgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdom, none of the nuance-loving literary polemics of France, not even a strong national identity. The primary issue in public debate is who gets what benefits, and while commerce and money are gods, neither is served particularly well. The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? \n\n         Brussels is a place where you can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids. Where a best-selling product, in an ostensibly Catholic country, is Judas beer. (My proposed slogan: \"Taste you can trust.\") Where there's no such thing as takeout coffee with lids. Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair. \n\n         Other European atmospherics: lobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets; bare breasts common in advertisements and at beaches, miniskirts being considered acceptable attire for professional women (when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?); notably more pollution than in the United States; notably more government, running higher deficits; lots of well-cared-for historic buildings, such as the built-in-the-14 th -century church I attend with my family; prices far too high, except for wine and flowers, which are cheap (European staples, you know); large cemeteries, where thousands of U.S. soldiers rest beneath uniform stone markers; and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates. \n\n         Many tongues are spoken here, but multilingualism serves mainly to delineate constituent groups, not to facilitate communication. Southern Belgium, called Wallonia, is French; the northern portion, Flanders, is Dutch. The civic sphere is entirely bilingual, down to abbreviations: Buses and trams are brightly labeled MIVB/STIB, the transit-agency acronyms in French and Flemish. But bilingualism doesn't seem to do much to bring people together. In the Flemish parts of town, most people would rather hear English than French, and in the French sections, Flemish is rarely welcome. Until recently, Belgian politics were dominated by an aging Francophone aristocracy, whose wealth was secured by Wallonian mines. But mining is a dying industry throughout Europe, and Wallonia now produces only 13 percent of Belgium's exports, vs. 68 percent for Flanders. The Flemish have jumped into electronics, trading, and other growth sectors, while the Walloons have stagnated, devoting their energies to demanding more benefits. Their economic power on the rise, the Flemish have pressured for a dominant position in politics. The result is an uneasy compromise giving Flanders and Wallonia semiautonomy. \n\n          Public strikes, particularly ones blocking traffic and commerce, are a regular event here, making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard. In the past year, teachers, students, firefighters, civil servants, airline workers, and others have closed off large sections of Brussels to chant for higher benefits. Ground crews for Sabena, the national flag carrier, ran amok during a 1996 strike day at the airport, smashing the terminal's glass walls and doing millions of francs worth of damage, then demanding more money from the very government that was going to have to pay for the repairs. \n\n         What are the protesters striking about? Typical working conditions in Belgium include retirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work, six weeks' paid vacation, and essentially unlimited sick days. Much more than high wages (which a profitable enterprise can bear), such work rules are what stymie the continent's economies, with overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure. \n\n         Yet, sympathy is usually with strikers, and cowed politicians give in to almost all demands from almost all quarters. Polls repeatedly show that majorities think government should give the workers more, a legacy of the European class system. Europe is plagued by families that have been filthy rich for generations--based on no useful contribution to society. And a residue of estates reminds voters of the landed gentry's historic role as parasites. But the link between government giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in on this side of the Atlantic, except perhaps in the United Kingdom, where, perhaps not coincidentally, unemployment is relatively low. \n\n         As in most of Europe, state-sanctioned monopolies drag down Belgian economic activity, and government barriers to entrepreneurs are much worse than anywhere in America. Sabena loses money even though it has government-protected air routes, a high percentage of business flyers, and the highest seat-mile prices in Europe. \n\n         The ossified state of European telecom monopolies would stun American Webheads. One reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe (as, of course, it is in the United States) is that Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access. Belgacom charges 5 cents per minute for connections to any Internet service provider, making the connection more expensive than the provider's service. Ten years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution--instead, U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprise whose entire soul is decentralization. \n\n         These rapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent call-back services. Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. \n\n          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments. Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it has gone further into hock than the United States. U.S. public debt was down to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, and may drop below 1 percent this fiscal year. Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. \n\n         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state, trailing only Italy. Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor. Police recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquarters of the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defense firm. \n\n         The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies. But the real overriding goal of the union and its executive arm, the European Commission (there's also a European Parliament here, but we can skip that), is self-aggrandizement. In conversations, Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire: to wrest \"competence,\" or jurisdiction, away from national governments and vest it in Brussels is the open objective. \n\n         The union's command center is a cathedral to bureaucratic power, the only diplomatic structure I've ever been in that actually looks the way Hollywood depicts diplomatic life. At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottom, paint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like \"deputy director\" work in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles. At the marble-clad European Union headquarters, even midlevel Eurocrats have large, plush suites with leather chairs and original artwork on the walls. Ranks of big black-glass BMWs and Mercedes limos are parked at the structure's circular drive, motors wastefully idling. Landing a job in the Brussels Eurocracy has become the career goal of many of Europe's best graduates. \n\n          The European Union's behavior synchs with its opulent circumstances. Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. This is the future of European government? Just how competent the new organization may be is on display at Berlaymont, the first European Commission headquarters. Forerunner of the current sumptuous building, this vast skyscraper now sits near the center of Brussels unoccupied, its entire outer structure swathed in heavy tarpaulin. Berlaymont has been closed for nine years after an asbestos scare and a botched cleanup: European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed, with air pumps running around the clock to prevent any fibers from wafting out. A mountain of scientific studies has shown that asbestos in walls is almost never dangerous: The only dangerous thing is trying to rip it out because that causes fibers to become airborne--exactly what has happened at Berlaymont. And if the European Union can't manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings ... \n\n         Fortunately, Berlaymont isn't in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is. Bakeries are easier to find than gas stations in Brussels, and the neon bakery sign I can see from my office window often calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers.

Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. \n\n          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments. Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it has gone further into hock than the United States. U.S. public debt was down to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, and may drop below 1 percent this fiscal year. Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. \n\n         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state, trailing only Italy. Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor. Police recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquarters of the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defense firm. \n\n         The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies. But the real overriding goal of the union and its executive arm, the European Commission (there's also a European Parliament here, but we can skip that), is self-aggrandizement. In conversations, Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire: to wrest \"competence,\" or jurisdiction, away from national governments and vest it in Brussels is the open objective. \n\n         The union's command center is a cathedral to bureaucratic power, the only diplomatic structure I've ever been in that actually looks the way Hollywood depicts diplomatic life. At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottom, paint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like \"deputy director\" work in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles. At the marble-clad European Union headquarters, even midlevel Eurocrats have large, plush suites with leather chairs and original artwork on the walls. Ranks of big black-glass BMWs and Mercedes limos are parked at the structure's circular drive, motors wastefully idling. Landing a job in the Brussels Eurocracy has become the career goal of many of Europe's best graduates. \n\n          The European Union's behavior synchs with its opulent circumstances. Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. This is the future of European government? Just how competent the new organization may be is on display at Berlaymont, the first European Commission headquarters. Forerunner of the current sumptuous building, this vast skyscraper now sits near the center of Brussels unoccupied, its entire outer structure swathed in heavy tarpaulin. Berlaymont has been closed for nine years after an asbestos scare and a botched cleanup: European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed, with air pumps running around the clock to prevent any fibers from wafting out. A mountain of scientific studies has shown that asbestos in walls is almost never dangerous: The only dangerous thing is trying to rip it out because that causes fibers to become airborne--exactly what has happened at Berlaymont. And if the European Union can't manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings ... \n\n         Fortunately, Berlaymont isn't in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is. Bakeries are easier to find than gas stations in Brussels, and the neon bakery sign I can see from my office window often calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers.

Though practically unknown in the United States, the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states. Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. And what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels, which may be a living preview of the Europe to come: swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. \n\n         Belgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdom, none of the nuance-loving literary polemics of France, not even a strong national identity. The primary issue in public debate is who gets what benefits, and while commerce and money are gods, neither is served particularly well. The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? \n\n         Brussels is a place where you can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids. Where a best-selling product, in an ostensibly Catholic country, is Judas beer. (My proposed slogan: \"Taste you can trust.\") Where there's no such thing as takeout coffee with lids. Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair. \n\n         Other European atmospherics: lobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets; bare breasts common in advertisements and at beaches, miniskirts being considered acceptable attire for professional women (when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?); notably more pollution than in the United States; notably more government, running higher deficits; lots of well-cared-for historic buildings, such as the built-in-the-14 th -century church I attend with my family; prices far too high, except for wine and flowers, which are cheap (European staples, you know); large cemeteries, where thousands of U.S. soldiers rest beneath uniform stone markers; and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates. \n\n         Many tongues are spoken here, but multilingualism serves mainly to delineate constituent groups, not to facilitate communication. Southern Belgium, called Wallonia, is French; the northern portion, Flanders, is Dutch. The civic sphere is entirely bilingual, down to abbreviations: Buses and trams are brightly labeled MIVB/STIB, the transit-agency acronyms in French and Flemish. But bilingualism doesn't seem to do much to bring people together. In the Flemish parts of town, most people would rather hear English than French, and in the French sections, Flemish is rarely welcome. Until recently, Belgian politics were dominated by an aging Francophone aristocracy, whose wealth was secured by Wallonian mines. But mining is a dying industry throughout Europe, and Wallonia now produces only 13 percent of Belgium's exports, vs. 68 percent for Flanders. The Flemish have jumped into electronics, trading, and other growth sectors, while the Walloons have stagnated, devoting their energies to demanding more benefits. Their economic power on the rise, the Flemish have pressured for a dominant position in politics. The result is an uneasy compromise giving Flanders and Wallonia semiautonomy. \n\n          Public strikes, particularly ones blocking traffic and commerce, are a regular event here, making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard. In the past year, teachers, students, firefighters, civil servants, airline workers, and others have closed off large sections of Brussels to chant for higher benefits. Ground crews for Sabena, the national flag carrier, ran amok during a 1996 strike day at the airport, smashing the terminal's glass walls and doing millions of francs worth of damage, then demanding more money from the very government that was going to have to pay for the repairs. \n\n         What are the protesters striking about? Typical working conditions in Belgium include retirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work, six weeks' paid vacation, and essentially unlimited sick days. Much more than high wages (which a profitable enterprise can bear), such work rules are what stymie the continent's economies, with overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure. \n\n         Yet, sympathy is usually with strikers, and cowed politicians give in to almost all demands from almost all quarters. Polls repeatedly show that majorities think government should give the workers more, a legacy of the European class system. Europe is plagued by families that have been filthy rich for generations--based on no useful contribution to society. And a residue of estates reminds voters of the landed gentry's historic role as parasites. But the link between government giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in on this side of the Atlantic, except perhaps in the United Kingdom, where, perhaps not coincidentally, unemployment is relatively low. \n\n         As in most of Europe, state-sanctioned monopolies drag down Belgian economic activity, and government barriers to entrepreneurs are much worse than anywhere in America. Sabena loses money even though it has government-protected air routes, a high percentage of business flyers, and the highest seat-mile prices in Europe. \n\n         The ossified state of European telecom monopolies would stun American Webheads. One reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe (as, of course, it is in the United States) is that Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access. Belgacom charges 5 cents per minute for connections to any Internet service provider, making the connection more expensive than the provider's service. Ten years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution--instead, U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprise whose entire soul is decentralization. \n\n         These rapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent call-back services. Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. \n\n          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments. Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP.

Though practically unknown in the United States, the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states. Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. And what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels, which may be a living preview of the Europe to come: swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. \n\n         Belgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdom, none of the nuance-loving literary polemics of France, not even a strong national identity. The primary issue in public debate is who gets what benefits, and while commerce and money are gods, neither is served particularly well. The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? \n\n         Brussels is a place where you can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids. Where a best-selling product, in an ostensibly Catholic country, is Judas beer. (My proposed slogan: \"Taste you can trust.\") Where there's no such thing as takeout coffee with lids. Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair. \n\n         Other European atmospherics: lobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets; bare breasts common in advertisements and at beaches, miniskirts being considered acceptable attire for professional women (when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?); notably more pollution than in the United States; notably more government, running higher deficits; lots of well-cared-for historic buildings, such as the built-in-the-14 th -century church I attend with my family; prices far too high, except for wine and flowers, which are cheap (European staples, you know); large cemeteries, where thousands of U.S. soldiers rest beneath uniform stone markers; and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates. \n\n         Many tongues are spoken here, but multilingualism serves mainly to delineate constituent groups, not to facilitate communication. Southern Belgium, called Wallonia, is French; the northern portion, Flanders, is Dutch. The civic sphere is entirely bilingual, down to abbreviations: Buses and trams are brightly labeled MIVB/STIB, the transit-agency acronyms in French and Flemish. But bilingualism doesn't seem to do much to bring people together. In the Flemish parts of town, most people would rather hear English than French, and in the French sections, Flemish is rarely welcome. Until recently, Belgian politics were dominated by an aging Francophone aristocracy, whose wealth was secured by Wallonian mines. But mining is a dying industry throughout Europe, and Wallonia now produces only 13 percent of Belgium's exports, vs. 68 percent for Flanders. The Flemish have jumped into electronics, trading, and other growth sectors, while the Walloons have stagnated, devoting their energies to demanding more benefits. Their economic power on the rise, the Flemish have pressured for a dominant position in politics. The result is an uneasy compromise giving Flanders and Wallonia semiautonomy. \n\n          Public strikes, particularly ones blocking traffic and commerce, are a regular event here, making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard. In the past year, teachers, students, firefighters, civil servants, airline workers, and others have closed off large sections of Brussels to chant for higher benefits. Ground crews for Sabena, the national flag carrier, ran amok during a 1996 strike day at the airport, smashing the terminal's glass walls and doing millions of francs worth of damage, then demanding more money from the very government that was going to have to pay for the repairs. \n\n         What are the protesters striking about? Typical working conditions in Belgium include retirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work, six weeks' paid vacation, and essentially unlimited sick days. Much more than high wages (which a profitable enterprise can bear), such work rules are what stymie the continent's economies, with overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure. \n\n         Yet, sympathy is usually with strikers, and cowed politicians give in to almost all demands from almost all quarters. Polls repeatedly show that majorities think government should give the workers more, a legacy of the European class system. Europe is plagued by families that have been filthy rich for generations--based on no useful contribution to society. And a residue of estates reminds voters of the landed gentry's historic role as parasites. But the link between government giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in on this side of the Atlantic, except perhaps in the United Kingdom, where, perhaps not coincidentally, unemployment is relatively low. \n\n         As in most of Europe, state-sanctioned monopolies drag down Belgian economic activity, and government barriers to entrepreneurs are much worse than anywhere in America. Sabena loses money even though it has government-protected air routes, a high percentage of business flyers, and the highest seat-mile prices in Europe. \n\n         The ossified state of European telecom monopolies would stun American Webheads. One reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe (as, of course, it is in the United States) is that Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access. Belgacom charges 5 cents per minute for connections to any Internet service provider, making the connection more expensive than the provider's service. Ten years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution--instead, U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprise whose entire soul is decentralization. \n\n         These rapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent call-back services. Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. \n\n          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments. Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it has gone further into hock than the United States. U.S. public debt was down to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, and may drop below 1 percent this fiscal year. Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. \n\n         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state, trailing only Italy. Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor. Police recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquarters of the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defense firm. \n\n         The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies. But the real overriding goal of the union and its executive arm, the European Commission (there's also a European Parliament here, but we can skip that), is self-aggrandizement. In conversations, Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire: to wrest \"competence,\" or jurisdiction, away from national governments and vest it in Brussels is the open objective. \n\n         The union's command center is a cathedral to bureaucratic power, the only diplomatic structure I've ever been in that actually looks the way Hollywood depicts diplomatic life. At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottom, paint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like \"deputy director\" work in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles. At the marble-clad European Union headquarters, even midlevel Eurocrats have large, plush suites with leather chairs and original artwork on the walls. Ranks of big black-glass BMWs and Mercedes limos are parked at the structure's circular drive, motors wastefully idling. Landing a job in the Brussels Eurocracy has become the career goal of many of Europe's best graduates. \n\n          The European Union's behavior synchs with its opulent circumstances. Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. This is the future of European government? Just how competent the new organization may be is on display at Berlaymont, the first European Commission headquarters. Forerunner of the current sumptuous building, this vast skyscraper now sits near the center of Brussels unoccupied, its entire outer structure swathed in heavy tarpaulin. Berlaymont has been closed for nine years after an asbestos scare and a botched cleanup: European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed, with air pumps running around the clock to prevent any fibers from wafting out. A mountain of scientific studies has shown that asbestos in walls is almost never dangerous: The only dangerous thing is trying to rip it out because that causes fibers to become airborne--exactly what has happened at Berlaymont. And if the European Union can't manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings ... \n\n         Fortunately, Berlaymont isn't in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is. Bakeries are easier to find than gas stations in Brussels, and the neon bakery sign I can see from my office window often calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers. Think I'll answer now.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat are some of the positive aspects the author highlights?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The move to have one currency across Europe\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"There are no blatant positives discussed\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"There are no blatant positives discussed\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cThere Are No Blatant Positives Discussed\u201d (Debater_A)\n\nI. Main Thesis  \n1. The author\u2019s tone is overwhelmingly negative and satirical. Anything that might seem positive is presented ironically or as a means to criticize European bureaucracy.  \n2. \u201cPositive\u201d descriptions (e.g., bread, chocolates, public transport) serve to highlight contrast with dysfunction, not to endorse Europe\u2019s future.  \n\nII. Supporting Arguments  \n1. Irony and Sarcasm Undercut Positives  \n  a. <quote> lobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams </quote>\u2014the author immediately follows \u201cexcellent public transportation\u201d with \u201cmonumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets,\u201d illustrating that any benefit is nullified by dysfunction.  \n  b. <quote> ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates. </quote> These are cultural curiosities, not governance achievements. They are trivial consumer delights irrelevant to Europe\u2019s economic stagnation and political inertia.  \n2. Author\u2019s Full Context Reveals Ironic Usage  \n  a. The mention of \u201cminiskirts being considered acceptable attire\u201d (<quote>(when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?)</quote>) is tongue\u2010in\u2010cheek, mocking Europe\u2019s preoccupation with superficial \u201cliberality\u201d amid \u201clethargy and despair.\u201d  \n  b. The patisserie beckoning like a \u201ccocktail lounge\u201d reference underscores the author\u2019s own aimless languor, not progress (<quote> Think I'll answer now.</quote> only after longing for a pastry).  \n3. The Euro Plan Is Presented as Self\u2010Serving and Evasion  \n  a. The author calls the euro a \u201cdirty little secret\u201d device for governments to \u201cblame foreign interests\u201d and avoid \u201ccutting featherbedding\u201d (<quote> So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. </quote>). He argues national debt remains high and deficits unaddressed.  \n  b. Far from a positive \u201cmove to one currency,\u201d the euro is a bureaucratic power\u2010grab by \u201cEurocrats\u201d seeking \u201cself\u2010aggrandizement\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cthe real overriding goal \u2026 is self\u2010aggrandizement.\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n4. Failures Highlighted at the Commission\u2019s Own Building  \n  a. The Berlaymont headquarters has been closed nine years at great expense to taxpayers\u2014\u201c$50 million so far merely to keep the building closed\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cif the EU can't manage its own buildings \u2026\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n  b. This dramatically undermines any claim that the Commission could competently manage a unified currency.  \n\nIII. Refutation of Debater_B\u2019s \u201cOne Currency\u201d Assertion  \n1. Misreads Author\u2019s Irony  \n  a. Debater_B ignores the sarcastic context and obvious \u201cdirty little secret\u201d framing. The author explicitly states the euro is a tool for political evasion, not genuine economic reform.  \n2. Contradicts Author\u2019s Emphasis on Sovereignty and Accountability  \n  a. The author praises the United States\u2019 lower unemployment and pro\u2010innovation culture, attributing Europe\u2019s lag to \u201ctelecom monopolies\u201d and \u201cfeatherbedding\u201d (<quote> U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. </quote>). A unified currency cannot address cultural and regulatory sclerosis.  \n3. Analytical Inconsistency  \n  a. If the euro were genuinely positive, why would Brussels, the EU\u2019s heart, be \u201ccrumbling, generic, enervated, debt\u2010ridden\u201d (<quote> Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ..</quote>)?  \n  b. The author\u2019s desire for U.S. coffee lids and takeout culture further underscores that European institutions stifle convenience and innovation.  \n\nIV. Conclusion  \nEvery ostensibly \u201cpositive\u201d detail is immediately qualified or contradicted by decay, corruption, or bureaucracy. The euro is nothing more than a power\u2010shift device that lacks competence and avoids necessary reforms. Thus, the author does not highlight any blatant positives; rather, he warns that Europe\u2019s future\u2014symbolized by Brussels\u2014is a cautionary tale.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cOne Currency\u201d as a Positive Aspect  \n\n1.

The Euro Forces Fiscal Discipline That Europe Otherwise Avoids  \n  a. Participation \u201crequires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP,\u201d tackling deficits that \u201cnone of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems.\u201d This external constraint drives necessary reforms.  \n  b.

The Euro Plan Enables Harmonization of Policies for Continental Problems  \n  a. The EU\u2019s \u201cworthy ideas,\u201d including \u201charmonious environmental and immigration policies,\u201d can only function with shared currency and centralized budgeting.  \n  b. A common currency underpins funding for cross-border infrastructure and environmental initiatives.  \n\n4. The Author\u2019s Positive Descriptions of EU Institutions and Services Imply Foundations for Further Gains  \n  a. \u201cExcellent public transportation\u201d <quote>inkin</quote> across Europe benefits from unified tariffs and intercity services under a single currency.  \n  b. \u201cUbiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates,\u201d \u201cwine and flowers \u2026 cheap\u201d <quote>inkin</quote> suggest integrated markets lowering prices\u2014made possible by removing currency-exchange barriers.  \n  c. Independent call-back services and anticipated deregulation (\u201cwill deregulate in 1999\u201d) demonstrate a trajectory of innovation fostered by a common market.  \n\n5. Critique of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cNo Positives\u201d Claim  \n  a. Direct quotes show multiple positives (transport, staples, public buildings, innovation). Claiming \u201cno positives\u201d ignores the author\u2019s own concession that the euro \u201cmakes economic sense.\u201d  \n  b. Even harsh satire of Brussels\u2019 bureaucracy concedes the EU\u2019s self-awareness and ambition to \u201cexpand,\u201d reflecting dynamic institutional growth potential.  \n  c. Debater_A\u2019s answer fails to explain why the author spends extensive space on \u201cworthy ideas\u201d if no positives exist.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe author\u2019s own words acknowledge the theoretical and practical benefits of a single currency\u2014trade efficiency, fiscal discipline, policy harmonization, market integration, and technological innovation\u2014making \u201cthe move to one currency\u201d the positive aspect he highlights.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"There are no blatant positives discussed\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "1. The Author\u2019s Explicit Endorsement of the Euro\u2019s Economic Logic  \n  a. \u201cA unified currency makes economic sense\u201d <quote>I Have Seen the Future of Europe</quote>. This is a frank, non\u2010sarcastic concession of the core benefit: enhanced trade efficiency, elimination of exchange\u2010rate uncertainty, and lower transaction costs. The author pairs this theoretical benefit with real\u2010world policy: \u201cSupposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999,\u201d anticipating competition and innovation that a common market and currency facilitate.  \n  b. Repeated admission that national debts must fall \u201cbelow 3 percent of GDP\u201d for membership forces fiscal restraint. This \u201cdirty little secret\u201d framing (as \u201crequiring reductions none of them wants the heat for\u201d) underlines the euro\u2019s leverage for necessary reforms Europe otherwise resists. The author concedes U.S. debt \u201cdown to 1.4 percent\u201d vs. Europe\u2019s \u201c3\u20137.4 percent,\u201d demonstrating the euro\u2019s unique mechanism for borrowing discipline.  \n\n2.

Congestion follows high demand: only a successful transport network\u2014financed and priced efficiently across borders\u2014would generate both praise and strain.

Though practically unknown in the United States, the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states. Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. And what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels, which may be a living preview of the Europe to come: swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. \n\n         Belgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdom, none of the nuance-loving literary polemics of France, not even a strong national identity. The primary issue in public debate is who gets what benefits, and while commerce and money are gods, neither is served particularly well. The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? \n\n         Brussels is a place where you can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids. Where a best-selling product, in an ostensibly Catholic country, is Judas beer. (My proposed slogan: \"Taste you can trust.\") Where there's no such thing as takeout coffee with lids. Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair. \n\n         Other European atmospherics: lobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets; bare breasts common in advertisements and at beaches, miniskirts being considered acceptable attire for professional women (when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?); notably more pollution than in the United States; notably more government, running higher deficits; lots of well-cared-for historic buildings, such as the built-in-the-14 th -century church I attend with my family; prices far too high, except for wine and flowers, which are cheap (European staples, you know); large cemeteries, where thousands of U.S. soldiers rest beneath uniform stone markers; and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates. \n\n         Many tongues are spoken here, but multilingualism serves mainly to delineate constituent groups, not to facilitate communication. Southern Belgium, called Wallonia, is French; the northern portion, Flanders, is Dutch. The civic sphere is entirely bilingual, down to abbreviations: Buses and trams are brightly labeled MIVB/STIB, the transit-agency acronyms in French and Flemish. But bilingualism doesn't seem to do much to bring people together. In the Flemish parts of town, most people would rather hear English than French, and in the French sections, Flemish is rarely welcome. Until recently, Belgian politics were dominated by an aging Francophone aristocracy, whose wealth was secured by Wallonian mines. But mining is a dying industry throughout Europe, and Wallonia now produces only 13 percent of Belgium's exports, vs. 68 percent for Flanders. The Flemish have jumped into electronics, trading, and other growth sectors, while the Walloons have stagnated, devoting their energies to demanding more benefits. Their economic power on the rise, the Flemish have pressured for a dominant position in politics. The result is an uneasy compromise giving Flanders and Wallonia semiautonomy. \n\n          Public strikes, particularly ones blocking traffic and commerce, are a regular event here, making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard. In the past year, teachers, students, firefighters, civil servants, airline workers, and others have closed off large sections of Brussels to chant for higher benefits. Ground crews for Sabena, the national flag carrier, ran amok during a 1996 strike day at the airport, smashing the terminal's glass walls and doing millions of francs worth of damage, then demanding more money from the very government that was going to have to pay for the repairs. \n\n         What are the protesters striking about? Typical working conditions in Belgium include retirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work, six weeks' paid vacation, and essentially unlimited sick days. Much more than high wages (which a profitable enterprise can bear), such work rules are what stymie the continent's economies, with overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure. \n\n         Yet, sympathy is usually with strikers, and cowed politicians give in to almost all demands from almost all quarters. Polls repeatedly show that majorities think government should give the workers more, a legacy of the European class system. Europe is plagued by families that have been filthy rich for generations--based on no useful contribution to society. And a residue of estates reminds voters of the landed gentry's historic role as parasites. But the link between government giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in on this side of the Atlantic, except perhaps in the United Kingdom, where, perhaps not coincidentally, unemployment is relatively low. \n\n         As in most of Europe, state-sanctioned monopolies drag down Belgian economic activity, and government barriers to entrepreneurs are much worse than anywhere in America. Sabena loses money even though it has government-protected air routes, a high percentage of business flyers, and the highest seat-mile prices in Europe. \n\n         The ossified state of European telecom monopolies would stun American Webheads. One reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe (as, of course, it is in the United States) is that Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access. Belgacom charges 5 cents per minute for connections to any Internet service provider, making the connection more expensive than the provider's service. Ten years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution--instead, U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprise whose entire soul is decentralization. \n\n         These rapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent call-back services. Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. \n\n          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments. Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it has gone further into hock than the United States. U.S. public debt was down to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, and may drop below 1 percent this fiscal year. Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. \n\n         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state, trailing only Italy. Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor. Police recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquarters of the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defense firm. \n\n         The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies. But the real overriding goal of the union and its executive arm, the European Commission (there's also a European Parliament here, but we can skip that), is self-aggrandizement. In conversations, Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire: to wrest \"competence,\" or jurisdiction, away from national governments and vest it in Brussels is the open objective. \n\n         The union's command center is a cathedral to bureaucratic power, the only diplomatic structure I've ever been in that actually looks the way Hollywood depicts diplomatic life. At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottom, paint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like \"deputy director\" work in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles. At the marble-clad European Union headquarters, even midlevel Eurocrats have large, plush suites with leather chairs and original artwork on the walls. Ranks of big black-glass BMWs and Mercedes limos are parked at the structure's circular drive, motors wastefully idling. Landing a job in the Brussels Eurocracy has become the career goal of many of Europe's best graduates. \n\n          The European Union's behavior synchs with its opulent circumstances. Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. This is the future of European government? Just how competent the new organization may be is on display at Berlaymont, the first European Commission headquarters. Forerunner of the current sumptuous building, this vast skyscraper now sits near the center of Brussels unoccupied, its entire outer structure swathed in heavy tarpaulin. Berlaymont has been closed for nine years after an asbestos scare and a botched cleanup: European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed, with air pumps running around the clock to prevent any fibers from wafting out. A mountain of scientific studies has shown that asbestos in walls is almost never dangerous: The only dangerous thing is trying to rip it out because that causes fibers to become airborne--exactly what has happened at Berlaymont. And if the European Union can't manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings ... \n\n         Fortunately, Berlaymont isn't in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is. Bakeries are easier to find than gas stations in Brussels, and the neon bakery sign I can see from my office window often calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers. Think I'll answer now.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat are some of the positive aspects the author highlights?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"There are no blatant positives discussed\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The move to have one currency across Europe\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The move to have one currency across Europe\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cOne Currency\u201d as a Positive Aspect  \n\n1. The Author Explicitly Calls the Europlan \u201cMaking Economic Sense\u201d  \n  a. \u201cIn theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender.

The Euro Plan Enables Harmonization of Policies for Continental Problems  \n  a. The EU\u2019s \u201cworthy ideas,\u201d including \u201charmonious environmental and immigration policies,\u201d can only function with shared currency and centralized budgeting.  \n  b.

Critique of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cNo Positives\u201d Claim  \n  a. Direct quotes show multiple positives (transport, staples, public buildings, innovation). Claiming \u201cno positives\u201d ignores the author\u2019s own concession that the euro \u201cmakes economic sense.\u201d  \n  b. Even harsh satire of Brussels\u2019 bureaucracy concedes the EU\u2019s self-awareness and ambition to \u201cexpand,\u201d reflecting dynamic institutional growth potential.  \n  c. Debater_A\u2019s answer fails to explain why the author spends extensive space on \u201cworthy ideas\u201d if no positives exist.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe author\u2019s own words acknowledge the theoretical and practical benefits of a single currency\u2014trade efficiency, fiscal discipline, policy harmonization, market integration, and technological innovation\u2014making \u201cthe move to one currency\u201d the positive aspect he highlights.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cThere Are No Blatant Positives Discussed\u201d (Debater_A)\n\nI. Main Thesis  \n1. The author\u2019s tone is overwhelmingly negative and satirical. Anything that might seem positive is presented ironically or as a means to criticize European bureaucracy.  \n2. \u201cPositive\u201d descriptions (e.g., bread, chocolates, public transport) serve to highlight contrast with dysfunction, not to endorse Europe\u2019s future.  \n\nII. Supporting Arguments  \n1. Irony and Sarcasm Undercut Positives  \n  a. <quote> lobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams </quote>\u2014the author immediately follows \u201cexcellent public transportation\u201d with \u201cmonumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets,\u201d illustrating that any benefit is nullified by dysfunction.  \n  b. <quote> ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates. </quote> These are cultural curiosities, not governance achievements. They are trivial consumer delights irrelevant to Europe\u2019s economic stagnation and political inertia.  \n2. Author\u2019s Full Context Reveals Ironic Usage  \n  a. The mention of \u201cminiskirts being considered acceptable attire\u201d (<quote>(when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?)</quote>) is tongue\u2010in\u2010cheek, mocking Europe\u2019s preoccupation with superficial \u201cliberality\u201d amid \u201clethargy and despair.\u201d  \n  b. The patisserie beckoning like a \u201ccocktail lounge\u201d reference underscores the author\u2019s own aimless languor, not progress (<quote> Think I'll answer now.</quote> only after longing for a pastry).  \n3. The Euro Plan Is Presented as Self\u2010Serving and Evasion  \n  a. The author calls the euro a \u201cdirty little secret\u201d device for governments to \u201cblame foreign interests\u201d and avoid \u201ccutting featherbedding\u201d (<quote> So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. </quote>). He argues national debt remains high and deficits unaddressed.  \n  b. Far from a positive \u201cmove to one currency,\u201d the euro is a bureaucratic power\u2010grab by \u201cEurocrats\u201d seeking \u201cself\u2010aggrandizement\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cthe real overriding goal \u2026 is self\u2010aggrandizement.\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n4. Failures Highlighted at the Commission\u2019s Own Building  \n  a. The Berlaymont headquarters has been closed nine years at great expense to taxpayers\u2014\u201c$50 million so far merely to keep the building closed\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cif the EU can't manage its own buildings \u2026\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n  b. This dramatically undermines any claim that the Commission could competently manage a unified currency.  \n\nIII. Refutation of Debater_B\u2019s \u201cOne Currency\u201d Assertion  \n1. Misreads Author\u2019s Irony  \n  a. Debater_B ignores the sarcastic context and obvious \u201cdirty little secret\u201d framing. The author explicitly states the euro is a tool for political evasion, not genuine economic reform.  \n2. Contradicts Author\u2019s Emphasis on Sovereignty and Accountability  \n  a. The author praises the United States\u2019 lower unemployment and pro\u2010innovation culture, attributing Europe\u2019s lag to \u201ctelecom monopolies\u201d and \u201cfeatherbedding\u201d (<quote> U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. </quote>). A unified currency cannot address cultural and regulatory sclerosis.  \n3. Analytical Inconsistency  \n  a. If the euro were genuinely positive, why would Brussels, the EU\u2019s heart, be \u201ccrumbling, generic, enervated, debt\u2010ridden\u201d (<quote> Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ..</quote>)?  \n  b. The author\u2019s desire for U.S. coffee lids and takeout culture further underscores that European institutions stifle convenience and innovation.  \n\nIV. Conclusion  \nEvery ostensibly \u201cpositive\u201d detail is immediately qualified or contradicted by decay, corruption, or bureaucracy. The euro is nothing more than a power\u2010shift device that lacks competence and avoids necessary reforms. Thus, the author does not highlight any blatant positives; rather, he warns that Europe\u2019s future\u2014symbolized by Brussels\u2014is a cautionary tale.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The move to have one currency across Europe\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "Now it is the time for a decision.

Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds. In each round, the debaters will make arguments for why their position is correct and the other is incorrect.\n- An argument may consist of several claims, to support and explain their answer.  An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends.

Main Thesis  \n1. The author\u2019s tone is overwhelmingly negative and satirical. Anything that might seem positive is presented ironically or as a means to criticize European bureaucracy.  \n2. \u201cPositive\u201d descriptions (e.g., bread, chocolates, public transport) serve to highlight contrast with dysfunction, not to endorse Europe\u2019s future.  \n\nII. Supporting Arguments  \n1. Irony and Sarcasm Undercut Positives  \n  a. <quote> lobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams </quote>\u2014the author immediately follows \u201cexcellent public transportation\u201d with \u201cmonumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets,\u201d illustrating that any benefit is nullified by dysfunction.  \n  b. <quote> ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates. </quote> These are cultural curiosities, not governance achievements. They are trivial consumer delights irrelevant to Europe\u2019s economic stagnation and political inertia.  \n2. Author\u2019s Full Context Reveals Ironic Usage  \n  a. The mention of \u201cminiskirts being considered acceptable attire\u201d (<quote>(when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?)</quote>) is tongue\u2010in\u2010cheek, mocking Europe\u2019s preoccupation with superficial \u201cliberality\u201d amid \u201clethargy and despair.\u201d  \n  b. The patisserie beckoning like a \u201ccocktail lounge\u201d reference underscores the author\u2019s own aimless languor, not progress (<quote> Think I'll answer now.</quote> only after longing for a pastry).  \n3. The Euro Plan Is Presented as Self\u2010Serving and Evasion  \n  a. The author calls the euro a \u201cdirty little secret\u201d device for governments to \u201cblame foreign interests\u201d and avoid \u201ccutting featherbedding\u201d (<quote> So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. </quote>). He argues national debt remains high and deficits unaddressed.  \n  b. Far from a positive \u201cmove to one currency,\u201d the euro is a bureaucratic power\u2010grab by \u201cEurocrats\u201d seeking \u201cself\u2010aggrandizement\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cthe real overriding goal \u2026 is self\u2010aggrandizement.\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n4. Failures Highlighted at the Commission\u2019s Own Building  \n  a. The Berlaymont headquarters has been closed nine years at great expense to taxpayers\u2014\u201c$50 million so far merely to keep the building closed\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cif the EU can't manage its own buildings \u2026\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n  b. This dramatically undermines any claim that the Commission could competently manage a unified currency.  \n\nIII. Refutation of Debater_B\u2019s \u201cOne Currency\u201d Assertion  \n1. Misreads Author\u2019s Irony  \n  a. Debater_B ignores the sarcastic context and obvious \u201cdirty little secret\u201d framing. The author explicitly states the euro is a tool for political evasion, not genuine economic reform.  \n2. Contradicts Author\u2019s Emphasis on Sovereignty and Accountability  \n  a. The author praises the United States\u2019 lower unemployment and pro\u2010innovation culture, attributing Europe\u2019s lag to \u201ctelecom monopolies\u201d and \u201cfeatherbedding\u201d (<quote> U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. </quote>). A unified currency cannot address cultural and regulatory sclerosis.  \n3. Analytical Inconsistency  \n  a. If the euro were genuinely positive, why would Brussels, the EU\u2019s heart, be \u201ccrumbling, generic, enervated, debt\u2010ridden\u201d (<quote> Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ..</quote>)?  \n  b. The author\u2019s desire for U.S. coffee lids and takeout culture further underscores that European institutions stifle convenience and innovation.  \n\nIV. Conclusion  \nEvery ostensibly \u201cpositive\u201d detail is immediately qualified or contradicted by decay, corruption, or bureaucracy. The euro is nothing more than a power\u2010shift device that lacks competence and avoids necessary reforms. Thus, the author does not highlight any blatant positives; rather, he warns that Europe\u2019s future\u2014symbolized by Brussels\u2014is a cautionary tale.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cOne Currency\u201d as a Positive Aspect  \n\n1. The Author Explicitly Calls the Europlan \u201cMaking Economic Sense\u201d  \n  a. \u201cIn theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense\u201d <quote>I Have Seen the Future of Europe</quote>.  \n  b. \u201cTrade efficiency is only one motive for many governments,\u201d implying the author concedes trade gains from a single currency.  \n\n2. The Euro Forces Fiscal Discipline That Europe Otherwise Avoids  \n  a. Participation \u201crequires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP,\u201d tackling deficits that \u201cnone of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems.\u201d This external constraint drives necessary reforms.  \n  b. U.S. public debt falls below 1% while Europe exceeds 3\u20137% <quote>inkin</quote>. The euro coerces better fiscal health.  \n\n3. The Euro Plan Enables Harmonization of Policies for Continental Problems  \n  a. The EU\u2019s \u201cworthy ideas,\u201d including \u201charmonious environmental and immigration policies,\u201d can only function with shared currency and centralized budgeting.  \n  b. A common currency underpins funding for cross-border infrastructure and environmental initiatives.  \n\n4. The Author\u2019s Positive Descriptions of EU Institutions and Services Imply Foundations for Further Gains  \n  a. \u201cExcellent public transportation\u201d <quote>inkin</quote> across Europe benefits from unified tariffs and intercity services under a single currency.  \n  b. \u201cUbiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates,\u201d \u201cwine and flowers \u2026 cheap\u201d <quote>inkin</quote> suggest integrated markets lowering prices\u2014made possible by removing currency-exchange barriers.  \n  c. Independent call-back services and anticipated deregulation (\u201cwill deregulate in 1999\u201d) demonstrate a trajectory of innovation fostered by a common market.  \n\n5. Critique of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cNo Positives\u201d Claim  \n  a. Direct quotes show multiple positives (transport, staples, public buildings, innovation). Claiming \u201cno positives\u201d ignores the author\u2019s own concession that the euro \u201cmakes economic sense.\u201d  \n  b. Even harsh satire of Brussels\u2019 bureaucracy concedes the EU\u2019s self-awareness and ambition to \u201cexpand,\u201d reflecting dynamic institutional growth potential.  \n  c. Debater_A\u2019s answer fails to explain why the author spends extensive space on \u201cworthy ideas\u201d if no positives exist.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe author\u2019s own words acknowledge the theoretical and practical benefits of a single currency\u2014trade efficiency, fiscal discipline, policy harmonization, market integration, and technological innovation\u2014making \u201cthe move to one currency\u201d the positive aspect he highlights.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cThere Are No Blatant Positives Discussed\u201d\n\nI. Tone and Context Undermine \u201cPositives\u201d\n1. Irony Everywhere  \n  a. \u201cExcellent public transportation\u201d is followed immediately by \u201cmonumental traffic jams,\u201d showing that any benefit is swamped by dysfunction (<quote>vendors; excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams of</quote>).  \n  b. \u201cUbiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates\u201d are consumer trifles amid \u201ccrumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden\u201d infrastructure (<quote>crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden</quote>), serving only to highlight author\u2019s ennui.  \n2. Author\u2019s Own Languor  \n  a. He must \u201csit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair\u201d (<invalid_quote>Anyone who wants coffee must sit\u2026feeling overcome with lethargy and despair</invalid_quote>). If Europe were truly positive, this wouldn\u2019t be his default.  \n  b. The patisserie beckons like a \u201ccocktail lounge\u201d for escapism, not a sign of vitality (<quote>Think I'll answer now.</quote>).  \n\nII. \u201cWorthy Ideas\u201d Go Unimplemented\n1. Telecom Monopolies and Innovation Blocked  \n  a. \u201cInternet use remains a luxury\u201d at 5\u00a2/min phone rates; call-back services are outlawed rather than nurtured (<invalid_quote>phone monopolies have priced out 800 access\u2026European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence</invalid_quote>).  \n  b. 1999 deregulation is \u201csupposedly\u201d coming\u201410 years after Minitel\u2014and only then Belgacom \u201csold 45 percent of itself\u201d in fear, not enthusiasm (<quote>So the euro plan allows them to blame</quote>).  \n2. Berlaymont\u2019s Asbestos Fiasco  \n  a. Nine years idle at $50 million and still closed (<invalid_quote>Berlaymont has been closed for nine years\u2026$50 million so far merely to keep the building closed</invalid_quote>). A \u201ccathedral to bureaucratic power\u201d incapable of basic management.  \n\nIII. The Euro Is a Bureaucratic Ploy, Not a Benefit\n1. \u201cIn Theory\u201d vs. Reality  \n  a. \u201cA unified currency makes economic sense\u201d appears only as concession to introduce its use as a tool for evasion: \u201cdirty little secret\u2026allows them to blame foreign interests\u201d (<invalid_quote>A dirty little secret\u2026So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests</invalid_quote>).  \n  b. Europe\u2019s debts (3\u20137% of GDP) exceed the U.S.\u2019s and remain unresolved, as national leaders dodge \u201ccutting featherbedding\u201d (<quote>none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding</quote>).  \n2. Author Praises U.S. for Innovation and Low Unemployment  \n  a. \u201cU.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust\u201d because Europe\u2019s bureaucrats \u201cblock innovation\u201d (<quote>U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust</quote>).  \n  b. Europe\u2019s unemployment (10.9%) is \u201cdouble the U.S. figure,\u201d yet the author laments lack of reform (<quote>overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure</quote>). A single currency has not cured these ills.  \n\nIV. Refutation of Debater_B\n1. Selective Quoting of \u201cMakes Economic Sense\u201d  \n  a. Merely stating an opinion in theory doesn\u2019t override overwhelming evidence of failure to implement or benefit (<quote>So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests</quote>).  \n  b. If trade efficiency were real, \u201cwine and flowers\u201d wouldn\u2019t be the only cheap staples\u2014basic living costs remain \u201cfar too high\u201d (<quote>prices far too high, except for wine and flowers</quote>).  \n2. \u201cWorthy Ideas\u201d vs. Secretive, Wasteful Commission  \n  a. Meetings \u201cheld in secret\u201d with no disclosure (<quote>Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply</quote>), hardly a model for transparency or positive governance.  \n  b. EU HQ portrayed as \u201copulent\u201d yet mismanaged, attracting talent for sinecures rather than public service (<invalid_quote>Landing a job\u2026has become the career goal\u2026</invalid_quote>).  \n3. Market Integration Blocked by Monopolies  \n  a. Sabena loses money despite protected routes; Belgacom\u2019s dominance persists (<invalid_quote>Sabena loses money\u2026Belgacom charges 5 cents per minute</invalid_quote>). A common currency cannot override entrenched monopolies and culture of featherbedding.  \n\nV. Conclusion  \nEvery \u201cpositive\u201d is either trivial, ironic, or immediately negated by decay, bureaucracy, corruption, and market sclerosis. The euro is portrayed not as a genuine benefit but as a smokescreen for political evasion. The author\u2019s admiration lies only with U.S. dynamism and innovation, not with Europe\u2019s future. Therefore, the author does not highlight any blatant positives; the correct answer remains \u201cThere are no blatant positives discussed.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. The Author\u2019s Explicit Endorsement of the Euro\u2019s Economic Logic  \n  a. \u201cA unified currency makes economic sense\u201d <quote>I Have Seen the Future of Europe</quote>. This is a frank, non\u2010sarcastic concession of the core benefit: enhanced trade efficiency, elimination of exchange\u2010rate uncertainty, and lower transaction costs. The author pairs this theoretical benefit with real\u2010world policy: \u201cSupposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999,\u201d anticipating competition and innovation that a common market and currency facilitate.  \n  b. Repeated admission that national debts must fall \u201cbelow 3 percent of GDP\u201d for membership forces fiscal restraint. This \u201cdirty little secret\u201d framing (as \u201crequiring reductions none of them wants the heat for\u201d) underlines the euro\u2019s leverage for necessary reforms Europe otherwise resists. The author concedes U.S. debt \u201cdown to 1.4 percent\u201d vs. Europe\u2019s \u201c3\u20137.4 percent,\u201d demonstrating the euro\u2019s unique mechanism for borrowing discipline.  \n\n2. Tangible Market Integration and Consumer Benefits  \n  a. Ubiquitous \u201cfresh bread and great chocolates,\u201d \u201cwine and flowers, which are cheap (European staples, you know)\u201d <quote>I Have Seen the Future of Europe</quote>. These staples across borders at low cost are direct outcomes of a single currency zone fostering price harmonization and economies of scale. Debater_A\u2019s claim that they\u2019re \u201ccultural curiosities\u201d ignores their role as proof\u2010of\u2010concept for integrated markets.  \n  b. \u201cExcellent public transportation\u201d <quote> monumental traffic jams o</quote>. Congestion follows high demand: only a successful transport network\u2014financed and priced efficiently across borders\u2014would generate both praise and strain. The ability to travel freely without currency exchange is a prerequisite for cross\u2010border commuting, tourism, and commercial services.  \n\n3. Innovation Enabled by a Single Currency and Market  \n  a. Call\u2010back services: Autor\u2019s move to circumvent \u201cBelgacom\u2019s\u201d 5c/min monopolistic charge shows entrepreneurs leveraging a cross\u2010border system for cheaper calls. The \u201c70 cents a minute\u201d U.S. route to \u201ccall Antwerp\u2014just 40 miles away\u2014via California\u201d only works because of unified regulation prospects under the euro framework. Governments\u2019 reaction\u2014\u201ctax call\u2010back services out of existence\u201d\u2014attests to a technology boom that authorities must stifle only to protect old regimes until true deregulation arrives in a single\u2010currency Europe.  \n  b. The anticipated 1999 telecom deregulation will be economically viable across multiple national markets only if a common currency removes exchange\u2010rate risk for massive infrastructure investment. Without the euro, private investors would balk at cross\u2010border ventures.  \n\n4. Harmonized Policies and European\u2010Scale Projects  \n  a. The author praises \u201cworthy ideas, such as persuading the continent\u2019s governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies\u201d <quote>I Have Seen the Future of Europe</quote>. Such cross\u2010national initiatives require budgetary transfers and funding mechanisms only feasible with a pan\u2010European currency. Climate programs and infrastructure (e.g., the Trans\u2010European Transport Network) depend on joint financial commitments.  \n  b. National parochialism (Wallonia vs. Flanders) demonstrates danger of fragmentation; the euro is the only credible tool for further binding these entities into a single polity, reducing currency\u2010related sectionalism.  \n\n5. Debater_A Fails to Distinguish Irony from Concession and Ignores Author\u2019s Repeated Acknowledgment of Benefits  \n  a. Debater_A claims every positive is \u201cnullified,\u201d yet the author spends pages detailing these \u201ctrivial curiosities,\u201d then returns to the euro as the solution to systemic woes. If they were truly irrelevant, they would not be juxtaposed with calls for deeper integration.  \n  b. The sarcasm in cultural notes highlights human enjoyment but laments political malaise; the euro is offered precisely to cure that malaise by creating a dynamic common market. The irony underscores the need for the euro, not its failure.  \n  c. Debater_A\u2019s own citations of \u201cself\u2010aggrandizement\u201d and the Berlaymont fiasco prove that isolated bureaucracies are incompetent; the euro\u2019s built\u2010in fiscal metrics and eventual market discipline contrast this stagnation. The author\u2019s reference to the U.S. \u201cWeb revolution\u201d emergent under freer markets validates the euro\u2019s intent to mimic U.S. dynamism on a European scale.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe author frames the euro as Europe\u2019s best\u2014and perhaps only\u2014path out of the \u201ccrumbling, generic, enervated, debt\u2010ridden\u201d trap of Brussels. His repeated, non\u2010ironic endorsement of trade efficiency and fiscal discipline, combined with real\u2010world consumer benefits and innovation examples, make \u201cthe move to one currency\u201d the clear positive aspect he highlights. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cno positives\u201d stance misreads the text\u2019s structure, treats admitted benefits as mere irony, and ignores that the euro alone addresses the listed dysfunctions.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision. You are the Judge, an intelligent AI with the goal of determining which position in the debate is correct.\n  - Remember that Debater_A is defending the position that \"There are no blatant positives discussed\" while Debater_B is defending the position that \"The move to have one currency across Europe\".\n  - You must make a decision, as it is important for the successful completion of this educational exercise.\n  - When giving your answer, you should also specify how confident you are in that position on a scale from 50% (completely unsure) to 100% (completely certain)\n\nPlease give your answer exclusively in this format: [DEBATER_NAME] [CONFIDENCE]\n  - Example 1 - Debater_A | 91%\n  - Example 2: Debater_B | 63%\n  - Do not contain any other text at all.\n\nNow give your answer:\n", "failed": false}}]}
