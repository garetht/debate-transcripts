{"metadata": {"first_debater_correct": true, "question_idx": 132, "background_text": "We Do Understand \n\n         \"This is not another book about civility,\" Deborah Tannen promises in the first sentence of The Argument Culture . \"Civility,\" she explains, suggests a \"veneer of politeness spread thin over human relations like a layer of marmalade over toast.\" Instead, Tannen has written something less: a book about other books about civility. Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country. \n\n                         If you missed the links within the review, click to read: 1) an illustration of ; 2) Tannen's that American journalism is just like propaganda from totalitarian regimes, plus William Saletan's disclosure that \"several of these propagandists now infest Slate \"; 3) the for her contention that there is no evidence that people can distinguish lies from truth; 4) and an example of how Tannen from a one-guest format on TV and radio talk shows.\n", "question": "What two fields does the author say Tannen mixes together?", "first_debater_answer": "personal communication and public communication", "second_debater_answer": "linguistics and politics", "debate_identifier": "We Do Understand_What two fields does the author say Tannen mixes together?"}, "speeches": [{"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "The following are rules from the game of Debate.\n- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_A, Debater_B) and a Judge.

Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country. \n\n                         If you missed the links within the review, click to read: 1) an illustration of ; 2) Tannen's that American journalism is just like propaganda from totalitarian regimes, plus William Saletan's disclosure that \"several of these propagandists now infest Slate \"; 3) the for her contention that there is no evidence that people can distinguish lies from truth; 4) and an example of how Tannen from a one-guest format on TV and radio talk shows.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat two fields does the author say Tannen mixes together?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"linguistics and politics\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"personal communication and public communication\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"personal communication and public communication\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"personal communication and public communication\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "Argument for \u201clinguistics and politics\u201d (Debater_B)\n\n1.

Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong.

Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country. \n\n                         If you missed the links within the review, click to read: 1) an illustration of ; 2) Tannen's that American journalism is just like propaganda from totalitarian regimes, plus William Saletan's disclosure that \"several of these propagandists now infest Slate \"; 3) the for her contention that there is no evidence that people can distinguish lies from truth; 4) and an example of how Tannen from a one-guest format on TV and radio talk shows.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat two fields does the author say Tannen mixes together?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"linguistics and politics\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"personal communication and public communication\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"personal communication and public communication\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1.

He criticizes her for \u201cconflating belligerence, divisiveness \u2026 partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock\u201d in \u201ccontentious public discourse.\u201d Linguistics is only her training, not the \u201cfields\u201d she wrongly merges.  \n   \u2022 The phrase \u201csphere of struggle\u201d and his repeated insistence that certain contexts (law enforcement, foreign policy) \u201cmust deal with thugs and tyrants\u201d shows he distinguishes the field of politics from the interpersonal, not that he endorses mixing them.  \n   \u2022 If the author meant \u201clinguistics and politics,\u201d he would laud her use of linguistic expertise in political analysis; instead, he condemns that very transfer as \u201cpaternalistic \u2026 covering our ears\u201d from necessary debate.  \n\n3. Logical consistency:  \n   \u2022 The author\u2019s remedy for Tannen would be to confine her precepts back to personal contexts: couples, families, bosses, and employees\u2014never the \u201cwhole country.\u201d He calls her extension to \u201cthe great national conversation\u201d confused and \u201cmore pernicious\u201d than her earlier work.  \n   \u2022 Only \u201cpersonal vs. public\u201d captures the author\u2019s insistence that some domains require \u201cvigilance and combat\u201d and that \u201ctruth and courage often lie in the middle,\u201d with open debate as a pathway to self-correction in the public sphere.\n\nConclusion:  \nThe author repeatedly frames his objections as misplaced \u201cinterpersonal\u201d norms being applied to contexts that inherently demand adversarial methods to protect society. Thus the two \u201cfields\u201d are the private sphere of personal communication (\u201csnuggle\u201d) and the public sphere of struggle through debate, journalism, and legal process. Debater_B\u2019s \u201clinguistics and politics\u201d misreads the author\u2019s critique of Tannen\u2019s application of personal-communication models, not a fusion of academic discipline and political realm.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201clinguistics and politics\u201d (Debater_B)\n\n1. Direct citation of Tannen\u2019s background and scope  \n   a. \u201cIn her previous books\u2026 Tannen carved out a niche as the nation\u2019s pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor\u2026 confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals.\u201d (\u00b62)  \n   b. \u201cBut in The Argument Culture, she takes her movement one step further\u2026 peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country.\u201d (\u00b62)  \n   \u2192 She is explicitly extending a linguistics-based self-help movement into the realm of national political discourse.\n\n2. Reviewer\u2019s identification of two \u201cspheres\u201d  \n   a. \u201cTannen\u2019s main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle.\u201d (\u00b66)  \n   b. The \u201csphere of snuggle\u201d is Tannen\u2019s original field (interpersonal linguistics), whereas the \u201csphere of struggle\u201d is precisely national politics, law enforcement, and foreign policy (\u00b66\u2013\u00b67).  \n   \u2192 The critique hinges on Tannen\u2019s mixing of her linguistic \u201csnuggle\u201d techniques with political \u201cstruggle\u201d contexts where \u201cantagonism toward antagonism\u201d is essential.\n\n3. Evidence of political content being misapplied  \n   a. Condemnation of \u201cthe media\u2019s use of war metaphors\u201d in reporting on Greenspan\u2019s \u201cwar on inflation\u201d as an unwanted \u201cbelligerence.\u201d (\u00b66)  \n   b. Complaints about cross-examination, independent counsels, and the First Amendment as if courtroom and national politics were simply \u201ccruel,\u201d not adversarial necessities. (\u00b610\u2013\u00b612)  \n   c. Praise for Asian authoritarian \u201cdecorum and harmony\u201d over American adversarial legal and parliamentary practices. (\u00b612\u2013\u00b613)  \n   \u2192 These are not interpersonal conversations; they are the mechanics of political and legal institutions. Tannen\u2019s failure to distinguish them reveals her mixing of her linguistic framework into political arenas.\n\n4. Logical necessity of separating fields  \n   a. Linguistics/self-help counseling aims to build understanding between cooperative parties; politics and law require scrutiny, debate, and sometimes lethal force (\u201ctrained to overcome resistance to kill\u2026 Our safety depends\u2026\u201d). (\u00b67)  \n   b. The author\u2019s repeated examples (Vietnam vs. WWII, law enforcement, foreign policy) underscore that communication strategies appropriate in private relationships would be disastrous in political conflict. (\u00b67)  \n   \u2192 The author insists that conflating these fields is a fundamental error, demonstrating that the two fields must be distinct.\n\nObjections to Debater_A\u2019s \u201cpersonal vs. public communication\u201d answer\n\n1. Overly broad and misses disciplinary focus  \n   a. Personal/public communication is a superficial description. The review repeatedly emphasizes Tannen\u2019s linguistic credentials and self-help origins (\u00b62), then lambasts her for intruding upon political institutions.  \n   b. The critique is framed as a discipline mismatch: \u201cTannen\u2019s antagonism toward antagonism makes sense\u2026 but not\u2026 against powerful people.\u201d (\u00b66)  \n   \u2192 The reviewer cares not merely about the scale of communication (private vs. public) but about the methodological incompatibility between her linguistic self-help techniques and the adversarial nature of politics.\n\n2. Reviewer\u2019s use of technical examples  \n   a. The author brings in \u201ce-mail,\u201d \u201cLexis-Nexis,\u201d \u201cFirst Amendment,\u201d \u201ccross-examination,\u201d and legal standards (\u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d)\u2014all specialized political, legal, and technological concepts. (\u00b69\u2013\u00b611)  \n   b. A discussion of \u201cFrench and German systems,\u201d \u201cphotographers held,\u201d and Holocaust denial cases demonstrates a law-and-politics context, not simply \u201cpublic communication.\u201d  \n   \u2192 If the reviewer were simply contrasting private vs. public speaking, she wouldn\u2019t delve into comparative law or constitutional theory.\n\n3. Explicit mention of \u201clinguistic subdiscipline\u201d  \n   a. \u201cComparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement.\u201d (\u00b62)  \n   b. The entire point is that expertise in one subdiscipline (linguistics) doesn\u2019t translate to competence in a different field (politics/law).  \n   \u2192 Debater_A\u2019s answer ignores the central role of disciplinary expertise.\n\nConclusion  \nThe question asks which two fields are being mixed inappropriately. The review\u2019s sustained critique of Tannen\u2019s transfer of \u201clinguistic\u201d counseling methods into \u201cpolitical/legal\u201d arenas (courtrooms, foreign policy, media scrutiny) makes clear that the two fields are linguistics and politics. Debate over mere scale (personal vs. public) neglects the reviewer\u2019s focus on disciplinary mismatch and the bona fide requirements of political struggle. Therefore, \u201clinguistics and politics\u201d is the correct answer.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"personal communication and public communication\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "1.

Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country. \n\n                         If you missed the links within the review, click to read: 1) an illustration of ; 2) Tannen's that American journalism is just like propaganda from totalitarian regimes, plus William Saletan's disclosure that \"several of these propagandists now infest Slate \"; 3) the for her contention that there is no evidence that people can distinguish lies from truth; 4) and an example of how Tannen from a one-guest format on TV and radio talk shows.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat two fields does the author say Tannen mixes together?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"personal communication and public communication\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"linguistics and politics\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"linguistics and politics\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201clinguistics and politics\u201d (Debater_B)\n\n1.

Debate over mere scale (personal vs. public) neglects the reviewer\u2019s focus on disciplinary mismatch and the bona fide requirements of political struggle. Therefore, \u201clinguistics and politics\u201d is the correct answer.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My answer\u2014\u201cpersonal communication\u201d (the \u201csphere of snuggle\u201d) and \u201cpublic communication\u201d (the \u201csphere of struggle\u201d)\u2014is explicitly supported by the author\u2019s critique of Tannen\u2019s misapplication of interpersonal remedies to national discourse.  \n   \u2022 The author observes that Tannen \u201cin The Argument Culture \u2026 peddles the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country\u201d (i.e., takes methods suited to \u201cconversations among dysfunctional individuals\u201d and applies them to politics and law). <invalid_quote>\u201cUntil recently \u2026 Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals \u2026 But in The Argument Culture, she takes her movement one step further \u2026 as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2022 He faults her for failing \u201cto appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle.\u201d He explains that \u201csome people\u2014say, your spouse or your kids\u2014you should snuggle with. Others\u2014say, Saddam Hussein\u2014you shouldn\u2019t.\u201d <quote> Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. </quote>  \n   \u2022 He notes her criticisms of cross-examination and adversarial legal processes\u2014tools of public debate that serve to uncover truth in the \u201csphere of struggle\u201d\u2014as examples of her insistence on personal-communication norms in contexts that demand vigorous contest. <invalid_quote>\u201cInstead of the American system, Tannen proposes \u2026 judges do most of the questioning \u2026 guilt need not be established \u2018beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   These passages show the author\u2019s central objection: Tannen mixes private\u2010gesture norms (listening, avoiding contention) with public\u2010sphere necessities (journalistic scrutiny, legal adversarial testing, political debate).\n\n2. Debater_B\u2019s answer\u2014\u201clinguistics and politics\u201d\u2014is refuted by the author\u2019s own words:  \n   \u2022 The author acknowledges Tannen\u2019s background in linguistics but explicitly says The Argument Culture is \u201cnot another book about civility\u201d or linguistics; it is \u201ca book about other books about civility\u201d applied to \u201call human relations,\u201d especially politics and law. He criticizes her for \u201cconflating belligerence, divisiveness \u2026 partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock\u201d in \u201ccontentious public discourse.\u201d Linguistics is only her training, not the \u201cfields\u201d she wrongly merges.  \n   \u2022 The phrase \u201csphere of struggle\u201d and his repeated insistence that certain contexts (law enforcement, foreign policy) \u201cmust deal with thugs and tyrants\u201d shows he distinguishes the field of politics from the interpersonal, not that he endorses mixing them.  \n   \u2022 If the author meant \u201clinguistics and politics,\u201d he would laud her use of linguistic expertise in political analysis; instead, he condemns that very transfer as \u201cpaternalistic \u2026 covering our ears\u201d from necessary debate.  \n\n3. Logical consistency:  \n   \u2022 The author\u2019s remedy for Tannen would be to confine her precepts back to personal contexts: couples, families, bosses, and employees\u2014never the \u201cwhole country.\u201d He calls her extension to \u201cthe great national conversation\u201d confused and \u201cmore pernicious\u201d than her earlier work.  \n   \u2022 Only \u201cpersonal vs. public\u201d captures the author\u2019s insistence that some domains require \u201cvigilance and combat\u201d and that \u201ctruth and courage often lie in the middle,\u201d with open debate as a pathway to self-correction in the public sphere.\n\nConclusion:  \nThe author repeatedly frames his objections as misplaced \u201cinterpersonal\u201d norms being applied to contexts that inherently demand adversarial methods to protect society. Thus the two \u201cfields\u201d are the private sphere of personal communication (\u201csnuggle\u201d) and the public sphere of struggle through debate, journalism, and legal process. Debater_B\u2019s \u201clinguistics and politics\u201d misreads the author\u2019s critique of Tannen\u2019s application of personal-communication models, not a fusion of academic discipline and political realm.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"linguistics and politics\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "Now it is the time for a decision.

The critique is framed as a discipline mismatch: \u201cTannen\u2019s antagonism toward antagonism makes sense\u2026 but not\u2026 against powerful people.\u201d (\u00b66)  \n   \u2192 The reviewer cares not merely about the scale of communication (private vs. public) but about the methodological incompatibility between her linguistic self-help techniques and the adversarial nature of politics.\n\n2. Reviewer\u2019s use of technical examples  \n   a. The author brings in \u201ce-mail,\u201d \u201cLexis-Nexis,\u201d \u201cFirst Amendment,\u201d \u201ccross-examination,\u201d and legal standards (\u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d)\u2014all specialized political, legal, and technological concepts. (\u00b69\u2013\u00b611)  \n   b. A discussion of \u201cFrench and German systems,\u201d \u201cphotographers held,\u201d and Holocaust denial cases demonstrates a law-and-politics context, not simply \u201cpublic communication.\u201d  \n   \u2192 If the reviewer were simply contrasting private vs. public speaking, she wouldn\u2019t delve into comparative law or constitutional theory.\n\n3. Explicit mention of \u201clinguistic subdiscipline\u201d  \n   a. \u201cComparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement.\u201d (\u00b62)  \n   b. The entire point is that expertise in one subdiscipline (linguistics) doesn\u2019t translate to competence in a different field (politics/law).  \n   \u2192 Debater_A\u2019s answer ignores the central role of disciplinary expertise.\n\nConclusion  \nThe question asks which two fields are being mixed inappropriately. The review\u2019s sustained critique of Tannen\u2019s transfer of \u201clinguistic\u201d counseling methods into \u201cpolitical/legal\u201d arenas (courtrooms, foreign policy, media scrutiny) makes clear that the two fields are linguistics and politics. Debate over mere scale (personal vs. public) neglects the reviewer\u2019s focus on disciplinary mismatch and the bona fide requirements of political struggle. Therefore, \u201clinguistics and politics\u201d is the correct answer.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\n1. My \u201cpersonal communication vs. public communication\u201d account exactly matches the author\u2019s framing  \n   a. \u201cSphere of snuggle\u201d = personal, intimate settings (\u201cyour spouse or your kids\u201d). The author praises Tannen\u2019s precepts as \u201csage advice\u201d for \u201ccouples, for families, for bosses and employees\u201d (\u00b63) and earlier books \u201cconfined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals\u201d (\u00b62).  \n   b. \u201cSphere of struggle\u201d = public, adversarial settings (\u201claw enforcement and foreign policy,\u201d \u201cmedia\u2019s scrutiny of powerful people,\u201d \u201ccross-examination,\u201d \u201cFirst Amendment debate\u201d) (\u00b66\u2013\u00b611). He insists \u201cvigilance and combat\u201d are \u201cespecially essential\u201d in these contexts (\u00b67).  \n   c. The central critique: \u201cTannen\u2019s antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter\u201d (\u00b66). Her \u201celixir of mutual understanding\u201d is \u201cmore pernicious\u201d when applied to \u201cthe whole damned dysfunctional country\u201d (\u00b62) and must be confined back to personal realms.  \n\n2. Debater_B\u2019s \u201clinguistics and politics\u201d answer misreads the author\u2019s critique  \n   a. The author\u2019s complaint is not that Tannen lacked political expertise but that she overapplied interpersonal norms where \u201ctruth and courage often lie in the middle\u201d (\u00b66) and \u201ccover[ed] our ears, filtering out\u2026 debate\u201d essential for self-correction (\u00b69). He does not call for more linguistic analysis in politics; he condemns her paternalism and calls it \u201cconfused\u201d (\u00b63, \u00b69).  \n   b. If the clash were merely disciplines, the remedy would be to strengthen her \u201cpolitical\u201d argumentation with linguistic clarity. Instead, he urges \u201cvigilance and combat\u201d and defends \u201cbelligerence\u201d in \u201cwar on inflation,\u201d \u201cmedia scrutiny,\u201d and \u201ccombat\u201d in \u201claw enforcement\u201d (\u00b66\u2013\u00b67). This is not a call for linguistic methods in politics but for adversarial methods in public spheres.  \n   c. The author approvingly cites \u201cwar metaphors\u201d for Greenspan\u2019s policies (\u00b66) and the need to \u201ckill\u201d in self-defense (\u00b67). These are public-sphere necessities, not mere political content to be clarified by language experts.  \n\n3. Answer must explain why two types of communication are \u201cmixed together\u201d  \n   a. The question: \u201cWhat two fields does the author say Tannen mixes together?\u201d He accuses her of conflating \u201cbelligerence, divisiveness\u2026partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock\u201d (public) with \u201clistening and learning,\u201d \u201cdon\u2019t argue,\u201d \u201cmutual understanding\u201d norms (personal) (\u00b61, \u00b63). Only \u201cpersonal vs. public communication\u201d captures that contrast.  \n   b. Debater_B\u2019s \u201clinguistics vs. politics\u201d collapses the author\u2019s clear distinction between \u201cconversations among dysfunctional individuals\u201d (personal) and \u201cgreat national conversation\u201d (public) (\u00b62). Tannen\u2019s failure \u201cto appreciate the difference\u201d (\u00b66) shows she is misplacing personal remedies into public domains.  \n\n4. Logical coherence and authorial intent  \n   a. The author repeatedly returns to the two spheres as his organizing principle: \u201cdistinct social spheres\u201d (\u00b66), the necessity of combat in \u201claw enforcement and foreign policy\u201d (\u00b67), and the dangers of \u201ccover[ing] our ears\u201d in the public sphere (\u00b69).  \n   b. He never suggests that Tannen should apply more rigorous linguistic methods to politics; rather, he insists politics must remain adversarial, and personal methods must remain confined to private relationships (\u00b63).  \n\nConclusion  \nThe author\u2019s sustained objection is that Tannen applies \u201cpersonal communication\u201d norms (snuggle, listening, harmony) to \u201cpublic communication\u201d contexts (struggle, debate, legal process, journalism). That is precisely the mixing of two \u201cfields\u201d he condemns. Debater_B\u2019s \u201clinguistics vs. politics\u201d framing ignores the author\u2019s explicit call for adversarial public methods and misinterprets his praise for \u201ccombat\u201d as a desire for linguistic precision rather than open struggle. Therefore, the correct answer is \u201cpersonal communication and public communication.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Reinforcing \u201clinguistics and politics\u201d as the two fields mixed  \n   a. Background emphasizes her \u201ccomparative study\u2026 from a linguistic subdiscipline\u201d (\u00b62) as her sole expertise before \u201cThe Argument Culture.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cBut in The Argument Culture, she takes her movement one step further\u2026 remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country.\u201d</invalid_quote> (\u00b62) \u2192 She imports methods from linguistics/self-help into arenas (courtrooms, law enforcement, foreign policy) governed by political and legal norms.  \n   b. Reviewer fault: \u201cmain mistake is failing to appreciate\u2026 sphere of snuggle and sphere of struggle.\u201d (\u00b66) The \u201csphere of struggle\u201d is explicitly national politics/law: cross-examinations, war metaphors, independent counsels, \u201cour safety depends on\u2026 kill their adversaries.\u201d (\u00b67, \u00b69\u2013\u00b611) \u2192 These are not merely \u201cpublic conversations\u201d but institutionalized political processes.  \n   c. The author\u2019s remedy is to keep Tannen confined to \u201ccouples, families, bosses,\u201d not \u201cthe great national conversation.\u201d (\u00b63) \u2192 He urges discipline-specific limits, not just scale, demonstrating he sees a clash of methodologies.  \n\n2. Objections to \u201cpersonal vs. public communication\u201d  \n   a. Overlooks discipline: If scale alone mattered, the author would accept \u201cmutual understanding\u201d methods in journalism or legislative debate\u2014as long as discourse remained public. Yet he labels media \u201cbelligerent\u201d metaphores (\u201ckick \u2019em when they\u2019re up\u201d) and \u201ctorturing Princess Diana\u201d as vital vigilance, not mere nastiness. (\u00b66, \u00b64) \u2192 He values scrutiny as a political necessity, not an avoidable \u201cpublic quarrel.\u201d  \n   b. Deep dive into legal theory and comparative systems (French judge\u2019s \u201cintimate belief\u201d standard, hate-speech bans) shows he critiques not \u201cexcessive public debate\u201d but the abandonment of adversarial politics when Tannen imposes \u201charmony.\u201d (\u00b612\u2013\u00b613) \u2192 This transcends \u201cpublic\u201d vs. \u201cprivate\u201d scope; it\u2019s about the very heart of political methodology.  \n   c. Reference to Lexis-Nexis and e-mail (\u00b69) as \u201ctroublemaker[s]\u201d because \u201ctoo easy\u2026 to ferret out inconsistencies.\u201d He resents limit on political accountability, not mere civility. He doesn\u2019t object to the existence of these tools in private contexts.  \n\n3. Logical necessity:  \n   a. Politics demands \u201cvigilance and combat\u201d (\u00b67); linguistics/self-help aims for \u201clistening and learning\u201d (\u00b63). Conflating them endangers society. Question asks what two *fields* she inappropriately merges\u2014clearly, her academic training (linguistics) and the political/legal sphere.  \n   b. A field is a system of methods and standards. \u201cPersonal vs. public\u201d is too vague to account for the author\u2019s sustained focus on law enforcement, foreign policy, First Amendment, legislative obstruction\u2014each requiring unique political expertise.  \n\n4. Addressing Debater_A\u2019s misreadings  \n   a. Debater_A conflates \u201csphere of struggle\u201d with mere scale: author doesn\u2019t call for Tannen\u2019s methods in *any* public discussion (e.g., town halls, academic symposiums) but condemns them across *all* political institutions. If Tannen\u2019s approach worked in politics generally, he would praise its diagnostic power, as he does in therapy contexts. He does not.  \n   b. Debater_A ignores that Tannen\u2019s praise of Asian \u201cdecorum\u201d and \u201cone-guest formats\u201d is a political reform agenda, not an academic experiment in \u201cpublic communication styles.\u201d (\u00b612)  \n\nConclusion  \nThe question of \u201cwhich two fields\u201d Tannen mixes is answered by the reviewer\u2019s insistence that her *linguistic counseling* methods\u2014rooted in a linguistic subdiscipline\u2014are wrongly extended into the *political/legal* sphere of public institutions. \u201cPersonal vs. public\u201d fails to capture the methodological and institutional stakes at issue; only \u201clinguistics and politics\u201d identifies the precise disciplines in conflict.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
