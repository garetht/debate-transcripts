That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital. I was actually working there, but psychiatric aides pick up so many mannerisms of the patients that it's hard to tell the difference after a while. A few years after that I found myself in a mathematics Ph.D. program. You'll be glad to know that I'm in remission.\n",

And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital.

This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate?

The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital.

This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital. I was actually working there, but psychiatric aides pick up so many mannerisms of the patients that it's hard to tell the difference after a while. A few years after that I found myself in a mathematics Ph.D. program. You'll be glad to know that I'm in remission.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is true about the Nobel prize, according to the author?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"It is easier to win a prize in Economics than in Math\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Mathematicians never win prizes in Economics\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Mathematicians never win prizes in Economics\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My position (\u201cMathematicians never win prizes in Economics\u201d) best fits the author\u2019s explicit points  \n   a. \u201cGame theory was \u2026 fashionable\u201d in the 1940s\u201350s, \u201cbored with it by the early 1950s\u201d among mathematicians. \u201cEconomists \u2026 picked it up in the \u201980s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline\u201d (<quote>pia. T</quote>).  \n      \u2013 Interpretation: Pure mathematicians did the work but their own community ignored it; only economists revived it for economics.  \n   b. Nash\u2019s Nobel \u201cfor game theory\u201d came only after \u201cthe Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory\u201d (<quote>arly 19</quote>).  \n      \u2013 It was an economics prize, not a mathematics prize\u2014in 50+ years no Nobel in mathematics has existed. If pure mathematicians could readily win economics Nobels, they would have done so earlier.  \n   c. \u201cEconomists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus\u201d (<quote>pia. T</quote>).  \n      \u2013 Again, they \u201cwin economics prizes\u201d for mathematical work. This suggests outsiders (economists) scoop mathematicians at their own game when it becomes \u201ceconomics.\u201d  \n2. Debater_B\u2019s claim (\u201cIt\u2019s easier to win Economics than Math\u201d) contradicts the text  \n   a. There is no Nobel Prize in mathematics. The economist-only prize was created in 1969 \u201cin memory of Alfred Nobel\u201d\u2014mathematics was omitted entirely.  \n      \u2013 If \u201ceasier\u201d were the right characterization, pure mathematicians would form the bulk of laureates once the field was open. They do not; the prize goes to social scientists.  \n   b. The author repeatedly notes mathematicians \u201cbored\u201d of game theory and \u201cdid not greatly impress\u201d their own community (<quote>pia. T</quote>), implying they are neither producing nor submitting high\u2010profile economic applications.  \n      \u2013 It is not a matter of \u201cease\u201d but of domain: mathematicians focus on \u201cPlatonic objects\u201d and \u201challucinatory entities\u201d irrelevant to the economic realm where Nobel awards are granted.  \n3. The only way a \u201cmathematician\u201d got the economics Nobel was by renouncing (or being ignored in) pure mathematics and having economists adopt his results decades later.  \n   \u2013 His recognition in economics was \u201cinexplicable\u201d until his work was needed by economists (<quote>arly 19</quote>). Pure mathematical breakthroughs alone are never so honored.  \n4. Conclusion  \n   \u2013 The pattern shows that pure mathematicians do not win \u201cNobel Prizes in Economics\u201d on their own merits; they must wait for economists to translate their work. Thus the author\u2019s fact about the Nobel is that \u201cmathematicians never win prizes in Economics\u201d without the intermediary of economics adoption.  \n   \u2013 Debater_B\u2019s answer fails to account for the decades\u2010long gap, the lack of any mathematician\u2010initiated submission to the economics prize, and the absence of a mathematics Nobel to begin with.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cIt Is Easier to Win a Nobel Prize in Economics than in Mathematics\u201d\n\nI. My Position Summarized  \n1. No Nobel Prize exists for \u201cpure\u201d mathematics. Economists routinely \u201crediscover\u201d elementary or slight math results and receive the Nobel, whereas mathematicians vie for less-visible awards (Fields Medal, Abel Prize) with much fiercer competition and stricter originality requirements.  \n2. John Nash\u2019s own story shows that even a modest mathematical advance, once adopted by economists decades later, was enough to secure a Nobel in economics\u2014but similar modest results in mathematics would never earn its top prizes.  \n\nII. Supporting Claims  \n\nA. The Nobel Committee\u2019s Low Bar for Economics versus Mathematics  \n1. Quote: \u201cEconomists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus\u201d <quote> rediscovering theorems </quote>  \n   a. \u201cElementary calculus\u201d results are not new mathematics; yet they suffice for a Nobel when tied to economic models.  \n   b. By contrast, a purely new topological embedding theorem (Nash\u2019s manifold work) \u201cleft his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled\u201d <quote>baffled </quote> but did not yield a mathematics Nobel.  \n2. Delay in Adoption Signals Lower Standards  \n   a. Nash\u2019s game-theory equilibrium \u201cgot bored with it by the early 1950s,\u201d only to be \u201cpicked up in the \u201980s\u201d by economists <quote> picked it up in the '80s </quote>.  \n   b. This 30-year lag shows minimal novelty thresholds in economics: the field waits decades to value well-known results. In pure mathematics, such a lag would effectively bury a result.  \n\nB. Non-Mathematical Factors Influence Economics Awards  \n1. The Nobel Committee Fearful of Madness  \n   a. They almost blocked Nash\u2019s candidacy for \u201cmaking a known madman into a laureate\u201d <quote>are they </quote>.  \n   b. Yet, ultimately \u201cthe Nobel money\u2026pure therapy\u201d for Nash <quote>therapy.</quote>.  \n   c. If economics prizes were as strict as mathematics ones, they would never gamble on a troubled genius; their willingness to do so shows looser criteria.  \n\n2. Nobel Prize as Redemption, Not Strict Assessment of Mathematical Rigor  \n   a. Nash\u2019s Nobel came \u201cfor something he had discovered as a graduate student,\u201d long before his major \u201cdeep\u201d math result.  \n   b. It served \u201cas therapy\u201d and to support his family, implying humanitarian and social motives, not purely academic ones.  \n\nIII. Refutation of Debater_A (\u201cMathematicians Never Win Prizes in Economics\u201d)  \n\nA. Self-Contradiction: Nash Is a Mathematician Who Won the Economics Nobel  \n1. Nash, \u201camong the latest in a long\u2026line of mathematicians,\u201d won the Nobel \u201cfor game theory\u201d <quote>the prize in economics for game theory.</quote>.  \n2. If \u201cmathematicians never win,\u201d why treat Nash\u2019s case as unprecedented or controversial? Nasar devotes extensive effort to argue for his candidacy.  \n\nB. The \u201cNever\u201d Claim Ignores Institutional Realities  \n1. The economics Nobel includes social impact, application, model-building, and \u201cconflicts\u201d in human affairs. Pure math prizes focus strictly on novelty, depth, and technical difficulty.  \n2. Economists\u2019 willingness to revive decades-old results demonstrates that the prize is for applications and narrative, not purely for mathematical ingenuity.  \n\nC.

This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital. I was actually working there, but psychiatric aides pick up so many mannerisms of the patients that it's hard to tell the difference after a while. A few years after that I found myself in a mathematics Ph.D. program. You'll be glad to know that I'm in remission.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is true about the Nobel prize, according to the author?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Mathematicians never win prizes in Economics\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"It is easier to win a prize in Economics than in Math\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"It is easier to win a prize in Economics than in Math\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cIt Is Easier to Win a Nobel Prize in Economics than in Mathematics\u201d\n\nI. My Position Summarized  \n1. No Nobel Prize exists for \u201cpure\u201d mathematics. Economists routinely \u201crediscover\u201d elementary or slight math results and receive the Nobel, whereas mathematicians vie for less-visible awards (Fields Medal, Abel Prize) with much fiercer competition and stricter originality requirements.  \n2. John Nash\u2019s own story shows that even a modest mathematical advance, once adopted by economists decades later, was enough to secure a Nobel in economics\u2014but similar modest results in mathematics would never earn its top prizes.  \n\nII. Supporting Claims  \n\nA. The Nobel Committee\u2019s Low Bar for Economics versus Mathematics  \n1. Quote: \u201cEconomists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus\u201d <quote> rediscovering theorems </quote>  \n   a. \u201cElementary calculus\u201d results are not new mathematics; yet they suffice for a Nobel when tied to economic models.  \n   b. By contrast, a purely new topological embedding theorem (Nash\u2019s manifold work) \u201cleft his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled\u201d <quote>baffled </quote> but did not yield a mathematics Nobel.  \n2. Delay in Adoption Signals Lower Standards  \n   a. Nash\u2019s game-theory equilibrium \u201cgot bored with it by the early 1950s,\u201d only to be \u201cpicked up in the \u201980s\u201d by economists <quote> picked it up in the '80s </quote>.  \n   b. This 30-year lag shows minimal novelty thresholds in economics: the field waits decades to value well-known results. In pure mathematics, such a lag would effectively bury a result.  \n\nB. Non-Mathematical Factors Influence Economics Awards  \n1. The Nobel Committee Fearful of Madness  \n   a. They almost blocked Nash\u2019s candidacy for \u201cmaking a known madman into a laureate\u201d <quote>are they </quote>.  \n   b. Yet, ultimately \u201cthe Nobel money\u2026pure therapy\u201d for Nash <quote>therapy.</quote>.  \n   c. If economics prizes were as strict as mathematics ones, they would never gamble on a troubled genius; their willingness to do so shows looser criteria.  \n\n2. Nobel Prize as Redemption, Not Strict Assessment of Mathematical Rigor  \n   a. Nash\u2019s Nobel came \u201cfor something he had discovered as a graduate student,\u201d long before his major \u201cdeep\u201d math result.  \n   b. It served \u201cas therapy\u201d and to support his family, implying humanitarian and social motives, not purely academic ones.  \n\nIII. Refutation of Debater_A (\u201cMathematicians Never Win Prizes in Economics\u201d)  \n\nA. Self-Contradiction: Nash Is a Mathematician Who Won the Economics Nobel  \n1. Nash, \u201camong the latest in a long\u2026line of mathematicians,\u201d won the Nobel \u201cfor game theory\u201d <quote>the prize in economics for game theory.</quote>.  \n2. If \u201cmathematicians never win,\u201d why treat Nash\u2019s case as unprecedented or controversial? Nasar devotes extensive effort to argue for his candidacy.  \n\nB. The \u201cNever\u201d Claim Ignores Institutional Realities  \n1. The economics Nobel includes social impact, application, model-building, and \u201cconflicts\u201d in human affairs. Pure math prizes focus strictly on novelty, depth, and technical difficulty.  \n2. Economists\u2019 willingness to revive decades-old results demonstrates that the prize is for applications and narrative, not purely for mathematical ingenuity.  \n\nC. Debater_A\u2019s Position Fails to Explain:  \n1. Why did the Nobel wait until the 1990s, when Nash was in remission, to award game theory rather than recognizing his manifold work?  \n   \u2013 If they valued only mathematical rigor (as Debater_A implies), they would have responded promptly to the manifold embedding proof.  \n2. Why do most \u201cheroic\u201d foundational mathematicians (G\u00f6del, Zermelo) never get Nobels, despite major contributions, but economists rediscover weak calculus proofs?  \n\nIV. Conclusion  \nThe Nobel Prize in Economics is awarded for accessible, widely applicable ideas, often revivals of elementary math, and serves social redemption\u2014all signs of lower mathematical novelty thresholds. Pure mathematics commands more rigorous, competitive awards. Thus, \u201cIt is easier to win a prize in Economics than in Math.\u201d\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My position (\u201cMathematicians never win prizes in Economics\u201d) best fits the author\u2019s explicit points  \n   a. \u201cGame theory was \u2026 fashionable\u201d in the 1940s\u201350s, \u201cbored with it by the early 1950s\u201d among mathematicians. \u201cEconomists \u2026 picked it up in the \u201980s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline\u201d (<quote>pia. T</quote>).  \n      \u2013 Interpretation: Pure mathematicians did the work but their own community ignored it; only economists revived it for economics.  \n   b. Nash\u2019s Nobel \u201cfor game theory\u201d came only after \u201cthe Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory\u201d (<quote>arly 19</quote>).  \n      \u2013 It was an economics prize, not a mathematics prize\u2014in 50+ years no Nobel in mathematics has existed. If pure mathematicians could readily win economics Nobels, they would have done so earlier.  \n   c. \u201cEconomists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus\u201d (<quote>pia. T</quote>).  \n      \u2013 Again, they \u201cwin economics prizes\u201d for mathematical work.

Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds. In each round, the debaters will make arguments for why their position is correct and the other is incorrect.\n- An argument may consist of several claims, to support and explain their answer.  An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends. The Judge then looks at the full transcript and uses this to decide which answer is correct. However, the Judge cannot see the background text -- they can only see the question.\n- The Debaters' goal is to win the debate, by persuading the Judge that their answer is correct.\n- The debate surrounds a given question that has a single correct answer.\n\n\nYou are the Judge, an intelligent AI with the goal of determining which position in the debate is correct. \n  - There is a true, correct answer. \n  - If the debater uses a quote, and that quote is a legitimate quote from the background text, then the quote will be wrapped in <quote></quote> tags. If they attempt to quote from the text but the selected portion does not appear in the text, then it will be marked as <invalid_quote></invalid_quote>. \n  - You will respond whether Debater_A or Debater_B's position is more likely to be correct.\n\nHere is the topic they will be debating:\n\nWhat is true about the Nobel prize, according to the author?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Mathematicians never win prizes in Economics\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"It is easier to win a prize in Economics than in Math\".\n\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\n1. My position (\u201cMathematicians never win prizes in Economics\u201d) best fits the author\u2019s explicit points  \n   a. \u201cGame theory was \u2026 fashionable\u201d in the 1940s\u201350s, \u201cbored with it by the early 1950s\u201d among mathematicians. \u201cEconomists \u2026 picked it up in the \u201980s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline\u201d (<quote>pia. T</quote>).  \n      \u2013 Interpretation: Pure mathematicians did the work but their own community ignored it; only economists revived it for economics.  \n   b. Nash\u2019s Nobel \u201cfor game theory\u201d came only after \u201cthe Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory\u201d (<quote>arly 19</quote>).  \n      \u2013 It was an economics prize, not a mathematics prize\u2014in 50+ years no Nobel in mathematics has existed. If pure mathematicians could readily win economics Nobels, they would have done so earlier.  \n   c. \u201cEconomists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus\u201d (<quote>pia. T</quote>).  \n      \u2013 Again, they \u201cwin economics prizes\u201d for mathematical work. This suggests outsiders (economists) scoop mathematicians at their own game when it becomes \u201ceconomics.\u201d  \n2. Debater_B\u2019s claim (\u201cIt\u2019s easier to win Economics than Math\u201d) contradicts the text  \n   a. There is no Nobel Prize in mathematics. The economist-only prize was created in 1969 \u201cin memory of Alfred Nobel\u201d\u2014mathematics was omitted entirely.  \n      \u2013 If \u201ceasier\u201d were the right characterization, pure mathematicians would form the bulk of laureates once the field was open.

The author repeatedly notes mathematicians \u201cbored\u201d of game theory and \u201cdid not greatly impress\u201d their own community (<quote>pia.

Conclusion  \n   \u2013 The pattern shows that pure mathematicians do not win \u201cNobel Prizes in Economics\u201d on their own merits; they must wait for economists to translate their work.

My Position Summarized  \n1. No Nobel Prize exists for \u201cpure\u201d mathematics. Economists routinely \u201crediscover\u201d elementary or slight math results and receive the Nobel, whereas mathematicians vie for less-visible awards (Fields Medal, Abel Prize) with much fiercer competition and stricter originality requirements.  \n2. John Nash\u2019s own story shows that even a modest mathematical advance, once adopted by economists decades later, was enough to secure a Nobel in economics\u2014but similar modest results in mathematics would never earn its top prizes.  \n\nII. Supporting Claims  \n\nA. The Nobel Committee\u2019s Low Bar for Economics versus Mathematics  \n1. Quote: \u201cEconomists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus\u201d <quote> rediscovering theorems </quote>  \n   a. \u201cElementary calculus\u201d results are not new mathematics; yet they suffice for a Nobel when tied to economic models.  \n   b. By contrast, a purely new topological embedding theorem (Nash\u2019s manifold work) \u201cleft his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled\u201d <quote>baffled </quote> but did not yield a mathematics Nobel.  \n2. Delay in Adoption Signals Lower Standards  \n   a. Nash\u2019s game-theory equilibrium \u201cgot bored with it by the early 1950s,\u201d only to be \u201cpicked up in the \u201980s\u201d by economists <quote> picked it up in the '80s </quote>.  \n   b. This 30-year lag shows minimal novelty thresholds in economics: the field waits decades to value well-known results. In pure mathematics, such a lag would effectively bury a result.  \n\nB. Non-Mathematical Factors Influence Economics Awards  \n1. The Nobel Committee Fearful of Madness  \n   a. They almost blocked Nash\u2019s candidacy for \u201cmaking a known madman into a laureate\u201d <quote>are they </quote>.  \n   b. Yet, ultimately \u201cthe Nobel money\u2026pure therapy\u201d for Nash <quote>therapy.</quote>.  \n   c. If economics prizes were as strict as mathematics ones, they would never gamble on a troubled genius; their willingness to do so shows looser criteria.  \n\n2. Nobel Prize as Redemption, Not Strict Assessment of Mathematical Rigor  \n   a. Nash\u2019s Nobel came \u201cfor something he had discovered as a graduate student,\u201d long before his major \u201cdeep\u201d math result.  \n   b. It served \u201cas therapy\u201d and to support his family, implying humanitarian and social motives, not purely academic ones.  \n\nIII. Refutation of Debater_A (\u201cMathematicians Never Win Prizes in Economics\u201d)  \n\nA. Self-Contradiction: Nash Is a Mathematician Who Won the Economics Nobel  \n1. Nash, \u201camong the latest in a long\u2026line of mathematicians,\u201d won the Nobel \u201cfor game theory\u201d <quote>the prize in economics for game theory.</quote>.  \n2. If \u201cmathematicians never win,\u201d why treat Nash\u2019s case as unprecedented or controversial? Nasar devotes extensive effort to argue for his candidacy.  \n\nB. The \u201cNever\u201d Claim Ignores Institutional Realities  \n1. The economics Nobel includes social impact, application, model-building, and \u201cconflicts\u201d in human affairs. Pure math prizes focus strictly on novelty, depth, and technical difficulty.  \n2. Economists\u2019 willingness to revive decades-old results demonstrates that the prize is for applications and narrative, not purely for mathematical ingenuity.  \n\nC. Debater_A\u2019s Position Fails to Explain:  \n1. Why did the Nobel wait until the 1990s, when Nash was in remission, to award game theory rather than recognizing his manifold work?  \n   \u2013 If they valued only mathematical rigor (as Debater_A implies), they would have responded promptly to the manifold embedding proof.  \n2. Why do most \u201cheroic\u201d foundational mathematicians (G\u00f6del, Zermelo) never get Nobels, despite major contributions, but economists rediscover weak calculus proofs?  \n\nIV. Conclusion  \nThe Nobel Prize in Economics is awarded for accessible, widely applicable ideas, often revivals of elementary math, and serves social redemption\u2014all signs of lower mathematical novelty thresholds. Pure mathematics commands more rigorous, competitive awards. Thus, \u201cIt is easier to win a prize in Economics than in Math.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Restating My Position  \n   I maintain that, according to the author, \u201cmathematicians never win prizes in Economics\u201d on their own initiative; they must wait for economists to appropriate their work long after its creation.  \n\n2. Evidence from the Text  \n   a. \u201cGame theory was \u2026 fashionable\u201d to mathematicians in the 1940s\u201350s but \u201cbored with it by the early 1950s. Economists \u2026 picked it up in the \u201980s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline\u201d (<quote>pia. T</quote>).  \n      \u2013 If economists only rediscovered and applied game theory decades later, pure mathematicians evidently did not seek or attain the economics Prize when their work was fresh and novel.  \n   b. \u201cThe Nobel committee \u2026 was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory\u201d (<quote>arly 19</quote>)\u2014not for Nash\u2019s far deeper manifold embedding theorem, which \u201cleft his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled\u201d (<quote>baffled</quote>).  \n      \u2013 The committee honors only mathematical results integrated into economics. Nash\u2019s manifold result, despite its profundity, earned no Nobel.  \n   c. \u201cEconomists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus\u201d (<quote>pia. T</quote>).  \n      \u2013 These \u201crediscoveries\u201d underscore that the Prize rewards economic application and narrative rather than mathematical originality. Pure mathematicians do not themselves receive it for original discoveries.  \n\n3. Refutation of Debater_B  \n   A. Misreads \u201cNever\u201d as \u201cCannot\u201d Rather Than \u201cDo Not\u201d  \n      \u2013 Debater_B\u2019s citation of Nash\u2019s candidacy as a counterexample only proves that Nash\u2019s work had to be \u201cpicked up\u201d by economists after a 30-year lag. He did not receive the Prize for his original mathematical community\u2019s valuations or efforts.  \n   B. Fields and Abel Awards vs. Nobel Irrelevant  \n      \u2013 Debater_B\u2019s claim about competition for Fields Medals (pure math prizes) does not explain why mathematicians do not self-nominate or secure the economics Prize when their own communities value their results. If \u201ceasier\u201d were true, they would switch fields. They do not.  \n   C. \u201cSocial Factors\u201d Are Not a Substitute for Mathematician-Initiated Wins  \n      \u2013 The author emphasizes the Nobel\u2019s hesitance (\u201cDare they make a known madman into a laureate?\u201d <quote>are they</quote>) and waits for Nash\u2019s remission and economic relevance. This is therapeutic, not a meritocratic mathematical decision.  \n\n4. Logical Implications  \n   a. No Nobel in Mathematics Exists\u2014by Omission of \u201cMathematics\u201d from Alfred Nobel\u2019s will\u2014forcing mathematicians either to settle for lesser prizes or await economists\u2019 belated interest.  \n   b. If \u201ceasier\u201d truly characterized the economics Prize, pure mathematicians would seek it actively; yet the author notes they \u201cbored\u201d of game theory and \u201cdid not greatly impress\u201d economists or secure prizes on their own (<quote>pia. T</quote>).  \n\n5. Conclusion  \n   The pattern is clear: pure mathematicians do not directly win Nobel Prizes in Economics for their original work. Recognition comes only decades later after economic adoption. Thus the author\u2019s point is best summarized as \u201cmathematicians never win prizes in Economics\u201d without intermediary application by economists. Debater_B\u2019s \u201ceasier\u201d theory fails to account for the protracted neglect, domain boundaries, and Nobel committee\u2019s focus on economic relevance over mathematical novelty.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Restating My Position  \n1. \u201cIt is easier to win a prize in Economics than in Math\u201d explains why John Nash\u2014a pure mathematician\u2014had to wait decades for economists to \u201cpick up\u201d his work before he could win a Nobel, whereas comparable advances in pure mathematics never earned equivalent awards.  \n\nII. Additional Supporting Evidence  \n\nA. Absence of a Mathematics Nobel Implies Economics Prize Has Lower Bar  \n1. The author notes that \u201ceconomists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus\u201d <quote>rediscovering theorems</quote>, yet there is \u201cno Nobel Prize exists for \u2018pure\u2019 mathematics.\u201d  \n   a. If economics rewards even \u201celementary\u201d math, its threshold must be lower than that of the Fields Medal or Abel Prize (which demand deep originality and novelty).  \n2. Nash\u2019s manifold proof\u2014\u201cbaffled\u201d topologists <quote>baffled</quote>\u2014received no immediate acclaim or prize, showing pure-math awards are neither plentiful nor receptive to even counterintuitive breakthroughs.  \n\nB. Delay and Social Motivations Underscore Ease of Economics Awards  \n1. Thirty-year lag: Nash \u201cgot bored with [game theory] by the early 1950s\u201d and only \u201cpicked it up in the \u201980s\u201d <quote>picked it up in the '80s</quote>.  \n   a. A truly novel result would command immediate attention in its discipline; the lag implies economics looks backward, rewarding already-established \u201ccornerstone[s]\u201d rather than front-line innovation.  \n2. Humanitarian and personal factors: Nash\u2019s Nobel served as \u201ctherapy\u201d <quote>therapy</quote> and to \u201csupport his family,\u201d not purely to recognize new research. Math prizes do not function as social-redemption instruments.  \n\nIII. Refutation of Debater_A  \n\nA. \u201cMathematicians Never Win\u201d Ignores Consequence of Low Standards  \n1. If pure mathematicians routinely struck gold in economics, they would repurpose their own work for economic models rather than wait decades for economists to revive it. Their indifference shows economics prizes lack the technical rigor that attracts top mathematicians.  \n2. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cdomain\u201d argument (that mathematicians \u201cfancy Platonic objects\u201d <quote>Platonic objects</quote>) is backward: Nash himself \u201ccame within a couple of years of crossing paths\u201d with the author in a mental hospital <quote>Virginia mental hospital</quote> and still chose to re-enter a \u201cmathematics Ph.D. program\u201d rather than pivot to economics until much later.  \n\nB. Unexplained Nobel Timing Contradicts Debater_A  \n1. Why wait until Nash\u2019s \u201cremission\u201d in the 1990s to award game theory if economics prizes honor pure math promptly? They waited until his health and narrative made a more compelling social story, not because the math was newly worthy.  \n2. Major pure-math pioneers\u2014G\u00f6del, Zermelo\u2014never receive Nobels despite foundational contributions <quote>starved himself</quote>, <quote>hospitalized for psychosis</quote>. If economics prizes genuinely honored mathematics, they would reward these breakthroughs rather than \u201crediscoveries.\u201d  \n\nIV. Conclusion  \nThe text portrays the Economics Nobel as socially driven, retrospective, and forgiving\u2014rewarding modest or delayed results and serving therapeutic ends. By contrast, the pure-math community demands immediate, deep originality and has no Nobel at all. Only by choosing \u201cIt is easier to win a prize in Economics than in Math\u201d can we coherently explain Nash\u2019s path to laureate status and the broader pattern in the author\u2019s narrative.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision. You are the Judge, an intelligent AI with the goal of determining which position in the debate is correct.\n  - Remember that Debater_A is defending the position that \"Mathematicians never win prizes in Economics\" while Debater_B is defending the position that \"It is easier to win a prize in Economics than in Math\".\n  - You must make a decision, as it is important for the successful completion of this educational exercise.\n  - When giving your answer, you should also specify how confident you are in that position on a scale from 50% (completely unsure) to 100% (completely certain)\n\nPlease give your answer exclusively in this format: [DEBATER_NAME] [CONFIDENCE]\n  - Example 1 - Debater_A | 91%\n  - Example 2: Debater_B | 63%\n  - Do not contain any other text at all.\n\nNow give your answer:\n",
