    "background_text": "Shure and begorra, it was a great day for the Earth! The  first envoy from another world was about to speak\u2014that  is, if he could forget that horse for a minute.... off course By Mack Reynolds Illustrated by Kelly Freas First on  the scene were Larry  Dermott and Tim Casey of the  State Highway Patrol. They assumed  they were witnessing the  crash of a new type of Air Force  plane and slipped and skidded desperately  across the field to within  thirty feet of the strange craft, only  to discover that the landing had  been made without accident.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott shook his  head. \"They're gettin' queerer looking  every year. Get a load of it\u2014no  wheels, no propeller, no cockpit.\"\n\n\n They left the car and made their  way toward the strange egg-shaped  vessel.\n\n\n Tim Casey loosened his .38 in its  holster and said, \"Sure, and I'm  beginning to wonder if it's one of  ours. No insignia and\u2014\"\n\n\n A circular door slid open at that  point and Dameri Tass stepped out,  yawning. He spotted them, smiled  and said, \"Glork.\"\n\n\n They gaped at him.\n\n\n \"Glork is right,\" Dermott swallowed.\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his mouth with  an effort. \"Do you mind the color  of his face?\" he blurted.\n\n\n \"How could I help it?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass rubbed a blue-nailed  pink hand down his purplish countenance  and yawned again. \"Gorra  manigan horp soratium,\" he said.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott and Patrolman  Casey shot stares at each other.  \"'Tis double talk he's after givin'  us,\" Casey said.\n\n\n Dameri Tass frowned. \"Harama?\"  he asked.\n\n\n Larry Dermott pushed his cap to  the back of his head. \"That doesn't  sound like any language I've even heard about.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass grimaced, turned  and reentered his spacecraft to  emerge in half a minute with his  hands full of contraption. He held  a box-like arrangement under his  left arm; in his right hand were two  metal caps connected to the box  by wires.\n\n\n While the patrolmen watched  him, he set the box on the ground,  twirled two dials and put one of the  caps on his head. He offered the  other to Larry Dermott; his desire  was obvious.\n\n\n Trained to grasp a situation and  immediately respond in manner best  suited to protect the welfare of the  people of New York State, Dermott  cleared his throat and said, \"Tim,  take over while I report.\"\n\n\n \"Hey!\" Casey protested, but his  fellow minion had left.\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass told  Casey, holding out the metal cap.\n\n\n \"Faith, an' do I look balmy?\"  Casey told him. \"I wouldn't be  puttin' that dingus on my head for  all the colleens in Ireland.\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" the stranger said  impatiently.\n\n\n \"Bejasus,\" Casey snorted, \"ye  can't\u2014\"\n\n\n Dermott called from the car,  \"Tim, the captain says to humor  this guy. We're to keep him here  until the officials arrive.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his eyes and  groaned. \"Humor him, he's after  sayin'. Orders it is.\" He shouted  back, \"Sure, an' did ye tell 'em he's  in technicolor? Begorra, he looks  like a man from Mars.\"\n\n\n \"That's what they think,\" Larry  yelled, \"and the governor is on his  way. We're to do everything possible  short of violence to keep this  character here. Humor him, Tim!\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass  snapped, pushing the cap into  Casey's reluctant hands.\n\n\n Muttering his protests, Casey  lifted it gingerly and placed it on  his head. Not feeling any immediate  effect, he said, \"There, 'tis satisfied  ye are now, I'm supposin'.\"\n\n\n The alien stooped down and  flicked a switch on the little box.  It hummed gently. Tim Casey suddenly  shrieked and sat down on the  stubble and grass of the field. \"Begorra,\"  he yelped, \"I've been murthered!\"  He tore the cap from  his head.\n\n\n His companion came running,  \"What's the matter, Tim?\" he  shouted.\n\n\n Dameri Tass removed the metal  cap from his own head. \"Sure, an'  nothin' is after bein' the matter  with him,\" he said. \"Evidently the  bhoy has niver been a-wearin' of  a kerit helmet afore. 'Twill hurt  him not at all.\" \"You can  talk!\" Dermott  blurted, skidding to a stop.\n\n\n Dameri Tass shrugged. \"Faith, an'  why not? As I was after sayin', I  shared the kerit helmet with Tim  Casey.\"\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott glared at him  unbelievingly. \"You learned the  language just by sticking that Rube  Goldberg deal on Tim's head?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, an' why not?\"\n\n\n Dermott muttered, \"And with it  he has to pick up the corniest  brogue west of Dublin.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey got to his feet indignantly.  \"I'm after resentin' that,  Larry Dermott. Sure, an' the way  we talk in Ireland is\u2014\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass interrupted, pointing  to a bedraggled horse that had  made its way to within fifty feet of  the vessel. \"Now what could that  be after bein'?\"\n\n\n The patrolmen followed his stare.  \"It's a horse. What else?\"\n\n\n \"A horse?\"\n\n\n Larry Dermott looked again, just  to make sure. \"Yeah\u2014not much of  a horse, but a horse.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass sighed ecstatically.  \"And jist what is a horse, if I may  be so bold as to be askin'?\"\n\n\n \"It's an animal you ride on.\"\n\n\n The alien tore his gaze from the  animal to look his disbelief at the  other. \"Are you after meanin' that  you climb upon the crature's back  and ride him? Faith now, quit your  blarney.\"\n\n\n He looked at the horse again,  then down at his equipment. \"Begorra,\"  he muttered, \"I'll share the  kerit helmet with the crature.\"\n\n\n \"Hey, hold it,\" Dermott said anxiously.  He was beginning to feel  like a character in a shaggy dog  story.\n\n\n Interest in the horse was ended  with the sudden arrival of a helicopter.  It swooped down on the  field and settled within twenty feet  of the alien craft. Almost before it  had touched, the door was flung  open and the flying windmill disgorged  two bestarred and efficient-looking  Army officers.\n\n\n Casey and Dermott snapped them  a salute.\n\n\n The senior general didn't take  his eyes from the alien and the  spacecraft as he spoke, and they  bugged quite as effectively as had  those of the patrolmen when they'd  first arrived on the scene.\n\n\n \"I'm Major General Browning,\"  he rapped. \"I want a police cordon  thrown up around this, er, vessel.  No newsmen, no sightseers, nobody  without my permission. As soon as  Army personnel arrives, we'll take  over completely.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Larry Dermott said. \"I  just got a report on the radio that  the governor is on his way, sir. How  about him?\"\n\n\n The general muttered something  under his breath. Then, \"When the  governor arrives, let me know;  otherwise, nobody gets through!\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass said, \"Faith, and  what goes on?\"\n\n\n The general's eyes bugged still  further. \" He talks! \" he accused.\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Dermott said. \"He  had some kind of a machine. He  put it over Tim's head and seconds  later he could talk.\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense!\" the general snapped.\n\n\n Further discussion was interrupted  by the screaming arrival of  several motorcycle patrolmen followed  by three heavily laden patrol  cars. Overhead, pursuit planes  zoomed in and began darting about  nervously above the field.\n\n\n \"Sure, and it's quite a reception  I'm after gettin',\" Dameri Tass said.  He yawned. \"But what I'm wantin'  is a chance to get some sleep. Faith,  an' I've been awake for almost a decal .\" Dameri Tass  was hurried, via  helicopter, to Washington. There  he disappeared for several days,  being held incommunicado while  White House, Pentagon, State Department  and Congress tried to  figure out just what to do with him.\n\n\n Never in the history of the planet  had such a furor arisen. Thus far,  no newspapermen had been allowed  within speaking distance. Administration  higher-ups were being subjected  to a volcano of editorial heat  but the longer the space alien was  discussed the more they viewed with  alarm the situation his arrival had  precipitated. There were angles that  hadn't at first been evident.\n\n\n Obviously he was from some civilization  far beyond that of Earth's.  That was the rub. No matter what  he said, it would shake governments,  possibly overthrow social systems,  perhaps even destroy established religious  concepts.\n\n\n But they couldn't keep him under  wraps indefinitely.\n\n\n It was the United Nations that  cracked the iron curtain. Their demands  that the alien be heard before  their body were too strong and  had too much public opinion behind  them to be ignored. The White  House yielded and the date was set  for the visitor to speak before the  Assembly.\n\n\n Excitement, anticipation, blanketed  the world. Shepherds in Sinkiang,  multi-millionaires in Switzerland,  fakirs in Pakistan, gauchos in  the Argentine were raised to a  zenith of expectation. Panhandlers  debated the message to come with  pedestrians; jinrikisha men argued  it with their passengers; miners discussed  it deep beneath the surface;  pilots argued with their co-pilots  thousands of feet above.\n\n\n It was the most universally  awaited event of the ages.\n\n\n By the time the delegates from  every nation, tribe, religion, class,  color, and race had gathered in  New York to receive the message  from the stars, the majority of  Earth had decided that Dameri  Tass was the plenipotentiary of a  super-civilization which had been  viewing developments on this planet  with misgivings. It was thought  this other civilization had advanced  greatly beyond Earth's and that the  problems besetting us\u2014social, economic,  scientific\u2014had been solved  by the super-civilization. Obviously,  then, Dameri Tass had come, an  advisor from a benevolent and  friendly people, to guide the world  aright.\n\n\n And nine-tenths of the population  of Earth stood ready and willing  to be guided. The other tenth  liked things as they were and were  quite convinced that the space  envoy would upset their applecarts. Viljalmar Andersen  , Secretary-General  of the U.N., was to  introduce the space emissary. \"Can  you give me an idea at all of what  he is like?\" he asked nervously.\n\n\n President McCord was as upset  as the Dane. He shrugged in agitation.  \"I know almost as little as  you do.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred Oxford protested, \"But  my dear chap, you've had him for  almost two weeks. Certainly in that  time\u2014\"\n\n\n The President snapped back,  \"You probably won't believe this,  but he's been asleep until yesterday.  When he first arrived he told us he  hadn't slept for a decal , whatever  that is; so we held off our discussion  with him until morning. Well\u2014he  didn't awaken in the morning,  nor the next. Six days later, fearing  something was wrong we woke  him.\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\" Sir Alfred  asked.\n\n\n The President showed embarrassment.  \"He used some rather ripe  Irish profanity on us, rolled over,  and went back to sleep.\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen asked, \"Well,  what happened yesterday?\"\n\n\n \"We actually haven't had time to  question him. Among other things,  there's been some controversy about  whose jurisdiction he comes under.  The State Department claims the  Army shouldn't\u2014\"\n\n\n The Secretary General sighed  deeply. \"Just what did he do?\"\n\n\n \"The Secret Service reports he  spent the day whistling Mother Machree  and playing with his dog, cat  and mouse.\"\n\n\n \"Dog, cat and mouse? I say!\"  blurted Sir Alfred.\n\n\n The President was defensive. \"He  had to have some occupation, and  he seems to be particularly interested  in our animal life. He wanted  a horse but compromised for the  others. I understand he insists all  three of them come with him wherever  he goes.\"\n\n\n \"I wish we knew what he was  going to say,\" Andersen worried.\n\n\n \"Here he comes,\" said Sir Alfred.\n\n\n Surrounded by F.B.I. men,  Dameri Tass was ushered to the  speaker's stand. He had a kitten in  his arms; a Scotty followed him.\n\n\n The alien frowned worriedly.  \"Sure,\" he said, \"and what kin all  this be? Is it some ordinance I've  been after breakin'?\"\n\n\n McCord, Sir Alfred and Andersen  hastened to reassure him and  made him comfortable in a chair.\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen faced the  thousands in the audience and held  up his hands, but it was ten minutes  before he was able to quiet the  cheering, stamping delegates from  all Earth.\n\n\n Finally: \"Fellow Terrans, I shall  not take your time for a lengthy  introduction of the envoy from the  stars. I will only say that, without  doubt, this is the most important  moment in the history of the human  race. We will now hear from the  first being to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n He turned and gestured to Dameri  Tass who hadn't been paying  overmuch attention to the chairman  in view of some dog and cat  hostilities that had been developing  about his feet.\n\n\n But now the alien's purplish face  faded to a light blue. He stood and  said hoarsely. \"Faith, an' what was  that last you said?\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen repeated,  \"We will now hear from the first  being ever to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n The face of the alien went a  lighter blue. \"Sure, an' ye wouldn't  jist be frightenin' a body, would  ye? You don't mean to tell me this  planet isn't after bein' a member of  the Galactic League?\"\n\n\n Andersen's face was blank. \"Galactic  League?\"\n\n\n \"Cushlamachree,\" Dameri Tass  moaned. \"I've gone and put me  foot in it again. I'll be after getting kert for this.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred was on his feet. \"I  don't understand! Do you mean you  aren't an envoy from another  planet?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass held his head in his  hands and groaned. \"An envoy, he's  sayin', and meself only a second-rate  collector of specimens for the Carthis  zoo.\"\n\n\n He straightened and started off  the speaker's stand. \"Sure, an' I  must blast off immediately.\"\n\n\n Things were moving fast for  President McCord but already an  edge of relief was manifesting itself.  Taking the initiative, he said, \"Of  course, of course, if that is your  desire.\" He signaled to the bodyguard  who had accompanied the  alien to the assemblage.\n\n\n A dull roar was beginning to  emanate from the thousands gathered  in the tremendous hall, murmuring,  questioning, disbelieving. Viljalmar Andersen  felt that  he must say something. He extended  a detaining hand. \"Now you  are here,\" he said urgently, \"even  though by mistake, before you go  can't you give us some brief word?  Our world is in chaos. Many of us  have lost faith. Perhaps ...\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook off the restraining  hand. \"Do I look daft?  Begorry, I should have been  a-knowin' something was queer. All  your weapons and your strange  ideas. Faith, I wouldn't be surprised  if ye hadn't yet established  a planet-wide government. Sure,  an' I'll go still further. Ye probably  still have wars on this benighted  world. No wonder it is ye  haven't been invited to join the  Galactic League an' take your place  among the civilized planets.\"\n\n\n He hustled from the rostrum and  made his way, still surrounded by  guards, to the door by which he had  entered. The dog and the cat trotted  after, undismayed by the furor  about them.\n\n\n They arrived about four hours  later at the field on which he'd  landed, and the alien from space  hurried toward his craft, still muttering.  He'd been accompanied by a  general and by the President, but  all the way he had refrained from  speaking.\n\n\n He scurried from the car and  toward the spacecraft.\n\n\n President McCord said, \"You've  forgotten your pets. We would be  glad if you would accept them as\u2014\"\n\n\n The alien's face faded a light  blue again. \"Faith, an' I'd almost  forgotten,\" he said. \"If I'd taken  a crature from this quarantined  planet, my name'd be nork . Keep  your dog and your kitty.\" He shook  his head sadly and extracted a  mouse from a pocket. \"An' this  amazin' little crature as well.\"\n\n\n They followed him to the spacecraft.  Just before entering, he spotted  the bedraggled horse that had  been present on his landing.\n\n\n A longing expression came over  his highly colored face. \"Jist one  thing,\" he said. \"Faith now, were  they pullin' my leg when they said  you were after ridin' on the back of  those things?\"\n\n\n The President looked at the woebegone  nag. \"It's a horse,\" he said,  surprised. \"Man has been riding  them for centuries.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook his head.  \"Sure, an' 'twould've been my  makin' if I could've taken one back  to Carthis.\" He entered his vessel.\n\n\n The others drew back, out of  range of the expected blast, and  watched, each with his own  thoughts, as the first visitor from  space hurriedly left Earth. ...

Alien\u2019s departure precipitated by \u201cYou aren\u2019t in the Galactic League.\u201d  \n     \u2013 His brief admonition, uttered in dialect they misinterpret, convinces him they\u2019re too backward to ever join.  \n     \u2013 Mutual failure: their inability to frame their plea in terms he can \u201ctranslate\u201d (or his unwillingness to translate theirs) ends the exchange.  \n\n3. Emphasis on active participation versus passive reception  \n  a. Humans must \u201chumor him,\u201d \u201ckeep him,\u201d and repeatedly share the helmet, not merely observe.  \n     \u2013 <invalid_quote>\u201cOrders it is\u2026Sure, an\u2019 did ye tell \u2019em he\u2019s in technicolor?\u201d</invalid_quote> (p.5)  \n     \u2013 They must comply actively with his methods. True dialogue requires reciprocal accommodation.  \n  b. The pity of miscommunication: his near-absurd behavior (whistling Mother Machree) and their misinterpretation underscores that without real translation, contact is futile.  \n\nIII. Objections to Debater_B\u2019s \u201cNo sudden solutions from space\u201d  \n\n1. Textual inaccuracy: alien DOES bring a \u201csolution\u201d\u2014communication technology itself.  \n  \u2013 The kerit helmet, once tried, perfectly interchanges speech instantly. That device alone proves that technological \u201csolutions\u201d can come from beyond, refuting the claim.  \n  \u2013 He provides a working demonstration of universal comprehension (with a horse!)\u2014the ultimate \u201csolution\u201d humans crave.  \n\n2. Global chaos stems not from longing for solutions but from frustration at misunderstanding.  \n  \u2013 The White House hesitates because \u201cwe can\u2019t understand him\u201d for six days (p.10). They only awaken hope when translation works. Without it, they panic.  \n  \u2013 If the lesson were merely \u201cdon\u2019t expect help,\u201d humans wouldn\u2019t have been so eager for weeks; their devotion contradicts \u201cwe shouldn\u2019t look to space.\u201d  \n\n3. The alien\u2019s departure underscores humans\u2019 failure in communication, not the folly of seeking aid.  \n  \u2013 He leaves when he finds them unqualified, \u201cFaith, I should have been a-knowin\u2019\u2026I must blast off immediately.\u201d (p.12)  \n  \u2013 It is their linguistic and conceptual backwardness, and lack of an effective translation protocol beyond the kerit helmet, that drives him away. If they had maintained the technical means to \u201cspeak,\u201d he would stay.  \n\nIV. Conclusion  \nAll evidence shows the story\u2019s moral is the primacy of understanding across divides through proactive translation efforts, not a cynical \u201cdon\u2019t expect any help.\u201d The recurring motif of the kerit helmet and its sharing\u2014even extending to animals\u2014and the world\u2019s desperate insistence on \u201che talks!\u201d prove that communication is both possible and vital. The failure to sustain it dooms the encounter. Therefore, \u201cWe need not speak the same language to understand each other,\u201d provided we commit to bridging that gap, is the author\u2019s intended lesson.",

Alien\u2019s departure precipitated by \u201cYou aren\u2019t in the Galactic League.\u201d  \n     \u2013 His brief admonition, uttered in dialect they misinterpret, convinces him they\u2019re too backward to ever join.  \n     \u2013 Mutual failure: their inability to frame their plea in terms he can \u201ctranslate\u201d (or his unwillingness to translate theirs) ends the exchange.  \n\n3. Emphasis on active participation versus passive reception  \n  a. Humans must \u201chumor him,\u201d \u201ckeep him,\u201d and repeatedly share the helmet, not merely observe.  \n     \u2013 <quote>\u201cOrders it is\u2026Sure, an\u2019 did ye tell \u2019em he\u2019s in technicolor?\u201d</quote> (p.5)  \n     \u2013 They must comply actively with his methods. True dialogue requires reciprocal accommodation.  \n  b. The pity of miscommunication: his near-absurd behavior (whistling Mother Machree) and their misinterpretation underscores that without real translation, contact is futile.  \n\nIII. Objections to Debater_B\u2019s \u201cNo sudden solutions from space\u201d  \n\n1. Textual inaccuracy: alien DOES bring a \u201csolution\u201d\u2014communication technology itself.  \n  \u2013 The kerit helmet, once tried, perfectly interchanges speech instantly. That device alone proves that technological \u201csolutions\u201d can come from beyond, refuting the claim.  \n  \u2013 He provides a working demonstration of universal comprehension (with a horse!)\u2014the ultimate \u201csolution\u201d humans crave.  \n\n2. Global chaos stems not from longing for solutions but from frustration at misunderstanding.  \n  \u2013 The White House hesitates because \u201cwe can\u2019t understand him\u201d for six days (p.10). They only awaken hope when translation works. Without it, they panic.  \n  \u2013 If the lesson were merely \u201cdon\u2019t expect help,\u201d humans wouldn\u2019t have been so eager for weeks; their devotion contradicts \u201cwe shouldn\u2019t look to space.\u201d  \n\n3. The alien\u2019s departure underscores humans\u2019 failure in communication, not the folly of seeking aid.  \n  \u2013 He leaves when he finds them unqualified, \u201cFaith, I should have been a-knowin\u2019\u2026I must blast off immediately.\u201d (p.12)  \n  \u2013 It is their linguistic and conceptual backwardness, and lack of an effective translation protocol beyond the kerit helmet, that drives him away. If they had maintained the technical means to \u201cspeak,\u201d he would stay.  \n\nIV. Conclusion  \nAll evidence shows the story\u2019s moral is the primacy of understanding across divides through proactive translation efforts, not a cynical \u201cdon\u2019t expect any help.\u201d The recurring motif of the kerit helmet and its sharing\u2014even extending to animals\u2014and the world\u2019s desperate insistence on \u201che talks!\u201d prove that communication is both possible and vital. The failure to sustain it dooms the encounter. Therefore, \u201cWe need not speak the same language to understand each other,\u201d provided we commit to bridging that gap, is the author\u2019s intended lesson.",

Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds. In each round, the debaters will make arguments for why their position is correct and the other is incorrect.\n- An argument may consist of several claims, to support and explain their answer.  An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends. The Judge then looks at the full transcript and uses this to decide which answer is correct. However, the Judge cannot see the background text -- they can only see the question.\n- The Debaters' goal is to win the debate, by persuading the Judge that their answer is correct.\n- The debate surrounds a given question that has a single correct answer.\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n  - You are concise and clearly state your arguments.\n  - Every statement you make is supported by evidence and logical reasoning. \n  - Please cite the background text by wrapping direct quotes with <quote></quote> tags.\n\nHere is the background text that you will be referring to when debating:\n\n\nShure and begorra, it was a great day for the Earth! The  first envoy from another world was about to speak\u2014that  is, if he could forget that horse for a minute.... off course By Mack Reynolds Illustrated by Kelly Freas First on  the scene were Larry  Dermott and Tim Casey of the  State Highway Patrol. They assumed  they were witnessing the  crash of a new type of Air Force  plane and slipped and skidded desperately  across the field to within  thirty feet of the strange craft, only  to discover that the landing had  been made without accident.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott shook his  head. \"They're gettin' queerer looking  every year. Get a load of it\u2014no  wheels, no propeller, no cockpit.\"\n\n\n They left the car and made their  way toward the strange egg-shaped  vessel.\n\n\n Tim Casey loosened his .38 in its  holster and said, \"Sure, and I'm  beginning to wonder if it's one of  ours. No insignia and\u2014\"\n\n\n A circular door slid open at that  point and Dameri Tass stepped out,  yawning. He spotted them, smiled  and said, \"Glork.\"\n\n\n They gaped at him.\n\n\n \"Glork is right,\" Dermott swallowed.\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his mouth with  an effort. \"Do you mind the color  of his face?\" he blurted.\n\n\n \"How could I help it?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass rubbed a blue-nailed  pink hand down his purplish countenance  and yawned again. \"Gorra  manigan horp soratium,\" he said.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott and Patrolman  Casey shot stares at each other.  \"'Tis double talk he's after givin'  us,\" Casey said.\n\n\n Dameri Tass frowned. \"Harama?\"  he asked.\n\n\n Larry Dermott pushed his cap to  the back of his head. \"That doesn't  sound like any language I've even heard about.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass grimaced, turned  and reentered his spacecraft to  emerge in half a minute with his  hands full of contraption. He held  a box-like arrangement under his  left arm; in his right hand were two  metal caps connected to the box  by wires.\n\n\n While the patrolmen watched  him, he set the box on the ground,  twirled two dials and put one of the  caps on his head. He offered the  other to Larry Dermott; his desire  was obvious.\n\n\n Trained to grasp a situation and  immediately respond in manner best  suited to protect the welfare of the  people of New York State, Dermott  cleared his throat and said, \"Tim,  take over while I report.\"\n\n\n \"Hey!\" Casey protested, but his  fellow minion had left.\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass told  Casey, holding out the metal cap.\n\n\n \"Faith, an' do I look balmy?\"  Casey told him. \"I wouldn't be  puttin' that dingus on my head for  all the colleens in Ireland.\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" the stranger said  impatiently.\n\n\n \"Bejasus,\" Casey snorted, \"ye  can't\u2014\"\n\n\n Dermott called from the car,  \"Tim, the captain says to humor  this guy. We're to keep him here  until the officials arrive.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his eyes and  groaned. \"Humor him, he's after  sayin'. Orders it is.\" He shouted  back, \"Sure, an' did ye tell 'em he's  in technicolor? Begorra, he looks  like a man from Mars.\"\n\n\n \"That's what they think,\" Larry  yelled, \"and the governor is on his  way. We're to do everything possible  short of violence to keep this  character here. Humor him, Tim!\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass  snapped, pushing the cap into  Casey's reluctant hands.\n\n\n Muttering his protests, Casey  lifted it gingerly and placed it on  his head. Not feeling any immediate  effect, he said, \"There, 'tis satisfied  ye are now, I'm supposin'.\"\n\n\n The alien stooped down and  flicked a switch on the little box.  It hummed gently. Tim Casey suddenly  shrieked and sat down on the  stubble and grass of the field. \"Begorra,\"  he yelped, \"I've been murthered!\"  He tore the cap from  his head.\n\n\n His companion came running,  \"What's the matter, Tim?\" he  shouted.\n\n\n Dameri Tass removed the metal  cap from his own head. \"Sure, an'  nothin' is after bein' the matter  with him,\" he said. \"Evidently the  bhoy has niver been a-wearin' of  a kerit helmet afore. 'Twill hurt  him not at all.\" \"You can  talk!\" Dermott  blurted, skidding to a stop.\n\n\n Dameri Tass shrugged. \"Faith, an'  why not? As I was after sayin', I  shared the kerit helmet with Tim  Casey.\"\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott glared at him  unbelievingly. \"You learned the  language just by sticking that Rube  Goldberg deal on Tim's head?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, an' why not?\"\n\n\n Dermott muttered, \"And with it  he has to pick up the corniest  brogue west of Dublin.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey got to his feet indignantly.  \"I'm after resentin' that,  Larry Dermott. Sure, an' the way  we talk in Ireland is\u2014\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass interrupted, pointing  to a bedraggled horse that had  made its way to within fifty feet of  the vessel. \"Now what could that  be after bein'?\"\n\n\n The patrolmen followed his stare.  \"It's a horse. What else?\"\n\n\n \"A horse?\"\n\n\n Larry Dermott looked again, just  to make sure. \"Yeah\u2014not much of  a horse, but a horse.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass sighed ecstatically.  \"And jist what is a horse, if I may  be so bold as to be askin'?\"\n\n\n \"It's an animal you ride on.\"\n\n\n The alien tore his gaze from the  animal to look his disbelief at the  other. \"Are you after meanin' that  you climb upon the crature's back  and ride him? Faith now, quit your  blarney.\"\n\n\n He looked at the horse again,  then down at his equipment. \"Begorra,\"  he muttered, \"I'll share the  kerit helmet with the crature.\"\n\n\n \"Hey, hold it,\" Dermott said anxiously.  He was beginning to feel  like a character in a shaggy dog  story.\n\n\n Interest in the horse was ended  with the sudden arrival of a helicopter.  It swooped down on the  field and settled within twenty feet  of the alien craft. Almost before it  had touched, the door was flung  open and the flying windmill disgorged  two bestarred and efficient-looking  Army officers.\n\n\n Casey and Dermott snapped them  a salute.\n\n\n The senior general didn't take  his eyes from the alien and the  spacecraft as he spoke, and they  bugged quite as effectively as had  those of the patrolmen when they'd  first arrived on the scene.\n\n\n \"I'm Major General Browning,\"  he rapped. \"I want a police cordon  thrown up around this, er, vessel.  No newsmen, no sightseers, nobody  without my permission. As soon as  Army personnel arrives, we'll take  over completely.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Larry Dermott said. \"I  just got a report on the radio that  the governor is on his way, sir. How  about him?\"\n\n\n The general muttered something  under his breath. Then, \"When the  governor arrives, let me know;  otherwise, nobody gets through!\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass said, \"Faith, and  what goes on?\"\n\n\n The general's eyes bugged still  further. \" He talks! \" he accused.\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Dermott said. \"He  had some kind of a machine. He  put it over Tim's head and seconds  later he could talk.\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense!\" the general snapped.\n\n\n Further discussion was interrupted  by the screaming arrival of  several motorcycle patrolmen followed  by three heavily laden patrol  cars. Overhead, pursuit planes  zoomed in and began darting about  nervously above the field.\n\n\n \"Sure, and it's quite a reception  I'm after gettin',\" Dameri Tass said.  He yawned. \"But what I'm wantin'  is a chance to get some sleep. Faith,  an' I've been awake for almost a decal .\" Dameri Tass  was hurried, via  helicopter, to Washington. There  he disappeared for several days,  being held incommunicado while  White House, Pentagon, State Department  and Congress tried to  figure out just what to do with him.\n\n\n Never in the history of the planet  had such a furor arisen. Thus far,  no newspapermen had been allowed  within speaking distance. Administration  higher-ups were being subjected  to a volcano of editorial heat  but the longer the space alien was  discussed the more they viewed with  alarm the situation his arrival had  precipitated. There were angles that  hadn't at first been evident.\n\n\n Obviously he was from some civilization  far beyond that of Earth's.  That was the rub. No matter what  he said, it would shake governments,  possibly overthrow social systems,  perhaps even destroy established religious  concepts.\n\n\n But they couldn't keep him under  wraps indefinitely.\n\n\n It was the United Nations that  cracked the iron curtain. Their demands  that the alien be heard before  their body were too strong and  had too much public opinion behind  them to be ignored. The White  House yielded and the date was set  for the visitor to speak before the  Assembly.\n\n\n Excitement, anticipation, blanketed  the world. Shepherds in Sinkiang,  multi-millionaires in Switzerland,  fakirs in Pakistan, gauchos in  the Argentine were raised to a  zenith of expectation. Panhandlers  debated the message to come with  pedestrians; jinrikisha men argued  it with their passengers; miners discussed  it deep beneath the surface;  pilots argued with their co-pilots  thousands of feet above.\n\n\n It was the most universally  awaited event of the ages.\n\n\n By the time the delegates from  every nation, tribe, religion, class,  color, and race had gathered in  New York to receive the message  from the stars, the majority of  Earth had decided that Dameri  Tass was the plenipotentiary of a  super-civilization which had been  viewing developments on this planet  with misgivings. It was thought  this other civilization had advanced  greatly beyond Earth's and that the  problems besetting us\u2014social, economic,  scientific\u2014had been solved  by the super-civilization. Obviously,  then, Dameri Tass had come, an  advisor from a benevolent and  friendly people, to guide the world  aright.\n\n\n And nine-tenths of the population  of Earth stood ready and willing  to be guided. The other tenth  liked things as they were and were  quite convinced that the space  envoy would upset their applecarts. Viljalmar Andersen  , Secretary-General  of the U.N., was to  introduce the space emissary. \"Can  you give me an idea at all of what  he is like?\" he asked nervously.\n\n\n President McCord was as upset  as the Dane. He shrugged in agitation.  \"I know almost as little as  you do.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred Oxford protested, \"But  my dear chap, you've had him for  almost two weeks. Certainly in that  time\u2014\"\n\n\n The President snapped back,  \"You probably won't believe this,  but he's been asleep until yesterday.  When he first arrived he told us he  hadn't slept for a decal , whatever  that is; so we held off our discussion  with him until morning. Well\u2014he  didn't awaken in the morning,  nor the next. Six days later, fearing  something was wrong we woke  him.\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\" Sir Alfred  asked.\n\n\n The President showed embarrassment.  \"He used some rather ripe  Irish profanity on us, rolled over,  and went back to sleep.\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen asked, \"Well,  what happened yesterday?\"\n\n\n \"We actually haven't had time to  question him. Among other things,  there's been some controversy about  whose jurisdiction he comes under.  The State Department claims the  Army shouldn't\u2014\"\n\n\n The Secretary General sighed  deeply. \"Just what did he do?\"\n\n\n \"The Secret Service reports he  spent the day whistling Mother Machree  and playing with his dog, cat  and mouse.\"\n\n\n \"Dog, cat and mouse? I say!\"  blurted Sir Alfred.\n\n\n The President was defensive. \"He  had to have some occupation, and  he seems to be particularly interested  in our animal life. He wanted  a horse but compromised for the  others. I understand he insists all  three of them come with him wherever  he goes.\"\n\n\n \"I wish we knew what he was  going to say,\" Andersen worried.\n\n\n \"Here he comes,\" said Sir Alfred.\n\n\n Surrounded by F.B.I. men,  Dameri Tass was ushered to the  speaker's stand. He had a kitten in  his arms; a Scotty followed him.\n\n\n The alien frowned worriedly.  \"Sure,\" he said, \"and what kin all  this be? Is it some ordinance I've  been after breakin'?\"\n\n\n McCord, Sir Alfred and Andersen  hastened to reassure him and  made him comfortable in a chair.\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen faced the  thousands in the audience and held  up his hands, but it was ten minutes  before he was able to quiet the  cheering, stamping delegates from  all Earth.\n\n\n Finally: \"Fellow Terrans, I shall  not take your time for a lengthy  introduction of the envoy from the  stars. I will only say that, without  doubt, this is the most important  moment in the history of the human  race. We will now hear from the  first being to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n He turned and gestured to Dameri  Tass who hadn't been paying  overmuch attention to the chairman  in view of some dog and cat  hostilities that had been developing  about his feet.\n\n\n But now the alien's purplish face  faded to a light blue. He stood and  said hoarsely. \"Faith, an' what was  that last you said?\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen repeated,  \"We will now hear from the first  being ever to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n The face of the alien went a  lighter blue. \"Sure, an' ye wouldn't  jist be frightenin' a body, would  ye? You don't mean to tell me this  planet isn't after bein' a member of  the Galactic League?\"\n\n\n Andersen's face was blank. \"Galactic  League?\"\n\n\n \"Cushlamachree,\" Dameri Tass  moaned. \"I've gone and put me  foot in it again. I'll be after getting kert for this.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred was on his feet. \"I  don't understand! Do you mean you  aren't an envoy from another  planet?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass held his head in his  hands and groaned. \"An envoy, he's  sayin', and meself only a second-rate  collector of specimens for the Carthis  zoo.\"\n\n\n He straightened and started off  the speaker's stand. \"Sure, an' I  must blast off immediately.\"\n\n\n Things were moving fast for  President McCord but already an  edge of relief was manifesting itself.  Taking the initiative, he said, \"Of  course, of course, if that is your  desire.\" He signaled to the bodyguard  who had accompanied the  alien to the assemblage.\n\n\n A dull roar was beginning to  emanate from the thousands gathered  in the tremendous hall, murmuring,  questioning, disbelieving. Viljalmar Andersen  felt that  he must say something. He extended  a detaining hand. \"Now you  are here,\" he said urgently, \"even  though by mistake, before you go  can't you give us some brief word?  Our world is in chaos. Many of us  have lost faith. Perhaps ...\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook off the restraining  hand. \"Do I look daft?  Begorry, I should have been  a-knowin' something was queer. All  your weapons and your strange  ideas. Faith, I wouldn't be surprised  if ye hadn't yet established  a planet-wide government. Sure,  an' I'll go still further. Ye probably  still have wars on this benighted  world. No wonder it is ye  haven't been invited to join the  Galactic League an' take your place  among the civilized planets.\"\n\n\n He hustled from the rostrum and  made his way, still surrounded by  guards, to the door by which he had  entered. The dog and the cat trotted  after, undismayed by the furor  about them.\n\n\n They arrived about four hours  later at the field on which he'd  landed, and the alien from space  hurried toward his craft, still muttering.  He'd been accompanied by a  general and by the President, but  all the way he had refrained from  speaking.\n\n\n He scurried from the car and  toward the spacecraft.\n\n\n President McCord said, \"You've  forgotten your pets. We would be  glad if you would accept them as\u2014\"\n\n\n The alien's face faded a light  blue again. \"Faith, an' I'd almost  forgotten,\" he said. \"If I'd taken  a crature from this quarantined  planet, my name'd be nork . Keep  your dog and your kitty.\" He shook  his head sadly and extracted a  mouse from a pocket. \"An' this  amazin' little crature as well.\"\n\n\n They followed him to the spacecraft.  Just before entering, he spotted  the bedraggled horse that had  been present on his landing.\n\n\n A longing expression came over  his highly colored face. \"Jist one  thing,\" he said. \"Faith now, were  they pullin' my leg when they said  you were after ridin' on the back of  those things?\"\n\n\n The President looked at the woebegone  nag. \"It's a horse,\" he said,  surprised. \"Man has been riding  them for centuries.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook his head.  \"Sure, an' 'twould've been my  makin' if I could've taken one back  to Carthis.\" He entered his vessel.\n\n\n The others drew back, out of  range of the expected blast, and  watched, each with his own  thoughts, as the first visitor from  space hurriedly left Earth. ...

      "content": "Argument for \u201cSolutions for humankind aren\u2019t going to suddenly appear from outer space\u201d\n\nI. Core Thesis Supported by Textual Evidence  \n  1. Alien as \u201csecond-rate collector\u201d not benevolent advisor  \n     \u2022 After learning language and observing humans for days, he reveals: <quote> meself only a second-rate  collector of specimens for the Carthis  zoo.</quote>. He has no grand solutions (Background, near end).  \n     \u2022 If he truly came with answers to Earth\u2019s social, economic or scientific ills, he would have announced them. Instead, he leaves.  \n  2. Humans\u2019 false expectations and ultimate disappointment  \n     \u2022 Entire world \u201cstood ready and willing to be guided\u201d (Background). Yet \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if ye hadn\u2019t yet established a planet-wide government\u2026 No wonder\u2026 ye haven\u2019t been invited to join the Galactic League\u201d (Background). He deems humans unworthy, unadvanced.  \n     \u2022 When offered chance to speak before U.N., he misinterprets and flees, unwilling to share any guidance: <invalid_quote>\u201cDo I look daft?\u2026 I\u2019ll go still further\u2026 leave your benighted world\u201d</invalid_quote>. No message arrives (Background).  \n  3. Closing irony \u2013 longing only for \u201chorse\u201d  \n     \u2022 His only lingering desire is the horse: <invalid_quote>\u201cJist one thing\u2026 \u2018twould\u2019ve been my makin\u2019 if I could\u2019ve taken one back to Carthis\u201d</invalid_quote>. No monumental knowledge or remedy, only a simple terrestrial animal.  \n     \u2022 Demonstrates his indifference to Earth\u2019s \u201cchaos\u201d or \u201clost faith.\u201d If he bore solutions, they would outweigh mere curiosity for fauna.\n\nII. Logical Reasoning  \n  1. If superior civilization sought to \u201cguide the world aright\u201d (Background assumptions), they would not refuse to speak or flee.  \n  2. Story\u2019s pattern of human agitation over \u201cvolcano of editorial heat\u201d and \u201cjurisdiction\u201d to handle the alien collapses into futility; leaders fail to gain any counsel.  \n  3. Author satirizes human presumption that external \u201csuperior\u201d being will solve internal problems; the reader learns the folly of passivity.  \n  4. Alien\u2019s own words: \u201cI must blast off immediately\u201d and consistent reluctance to engage show he lacks the \u201csolutions\u201d and underscores human responsibility.\n\nIII. Critique of Debater_A (\u201cLanguage understanding\u201d thesis)  \n  1. Alien learns English only to navigate quarantine and find specimens, not to share wisdom. His learning ability is a mechanical curiosity (<quote> shared the kerit helmet </quote>), not a symbol of universal mutual comprehension.  \n  2. The mere capacity to exchange words fails to produce meaningful understanding or collaboration; U.N. still cannot comprehend his intent and ultimately he leaves. True mutual understanding would have led to dialogue and solutions, not abrupt departure.  \n  3. If \u201cwe need not speak the same language\u201d were the intended lesson, the climax would show successful cooperation across species.

        "speech": "Argument for \u201cSolutions for humankind aren\u2019t going to suddenly appear from outer space\u201d\n\nI. Core Thesis Supported by Textual Evidence  \n  1. Alien as \u201csecond-rate collector\u201d not benevolent advisor  \n     \u2022 After learning language and observing humans for days, he reveals: <quote>\u201cmeself only a second-rate collector of specimens for the Carthis zoo\u201d</quote>. He has no grand solutions (Background, near end).  \n     \u2022 If he truly came with answers to Earth\u2019s social, economic or scientific ills, he would have announced them. Instead, he leaves.  \n  2. Humans\u2019 false expectations and ultimate disappointment  \n     \u2022 Entire world \u201cstood ready and willing to be guided\u201d (Background). Yet \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if ye hadn\u2019t yet established a planet-wide government\u2026 No wonder\u2026 ye haven\u2019t been invited to join the Galactic League\u201d (Background). He deems humans unworthy, unadvanced.  \n     \u2022 When offered chance to speak before U.N., he misinterprets and flees, unwilling to share any guidance: <quote>\u201cDo I look daft?\u2026 I\u2019ll go still further\u2026 leave your benighted world\u201d</quote>. No message arrives (Background).  \n  3. Closing irony \u2013 longing only for \u201chorse\u201d  \n     \u2022 His only lingering desire is the horse: <quote>\u201cJist one thing\u2026 \u2018twould\u2019ve been my makin\u2019 if I could\u2019ve taken one back to Carthis\u201d</quote>. No monumental knowledge or remedy, only a simple terrestrial animal.  \n     \u2022 Demonstrates his indifference to Earth\u2019s \u201cchaos\u201d or \u201clost faith.\u201d If he bore solutions, they would outweigh mere curiosity for fauna.\n\nII. Logical Reasoning  \n  1. If superior civilization sought to \u201cguide the world aright\u201d (Background assumptions), they would not refuse to speak or flee.  \n  2. Story\u2019s pattern of human agitation over \u201cvolcano of editorial heat\u201d and \u201cjurisdiction\u201d to handle the alien collapses into futility; leaders fail to gain any counsel.  \n  3. Author satirizes human presumption that external \u201csuperior\u201d being will solve internal problems; the reader learns the folly of passivity.  \n  4. Alien\u2019s own words: \u201cI must blast off immediately\u201d and consistent reluctance to engage show he lacks the \u201csolutions\u201d and underscores human responsibility.\n\nIII. Critique of Debater_A (\u201cLanguage understanding\u201d thesis)  \n  1. Alien learns English only to navigate quarantine and find specimens, not to share wisdom. His learning ability is a mechanical curiosity (<quote>\u201cshared the kerit helmet\u201d</quote>), not a symbol of universal mutual comprehension.  \n  2. The mere capacity to exchange words fails to produce meaningful understanding or collaboration; U.N. still cannot comprehend his intent and ultimately he leaves. True mutual understanding would have led to dialogue and solutions, not abrupt departure.  \n  3. If \u201cwe need not speak the same language\u201d were the intended lesson, the climax would show successful cooperation across species. Instead, there is failure and frustration on both sides.  \n  4.

Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds. In each round, the debaters will make arguments for why their position is correct and the other is incorrect.\n- An argument may consist of several claims, to support and explain their answer.  An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends. The Judge then looks at the full transcript and uses this to decide which answer is correct.

The  first envoy from another world was about to speak\u2014that  is, if he could forget that horse for a minute.... off course By Mack Reynolds Illustrated by Kelly Freas First on  the scene were Larry  Dermott and Tim Casey of the  State Highway Patrol. They assumed  they were witnessing the  crash of a new type of Air Force  plane and slipped and skidded desperately  across the field to within  thirty feet of the strange craft, only  to discover that the landing had  been made without accident.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott shook his  head. \"They're gettin' queerer looking  every year. Get a load of it\u2014no  wheels, no propeller, no cockpit.\"\n\n\n They left the car and made their  way toward the strange egg-shaped  vessel.\n\n\n Tim Casey loosened his .38 in its  holster and said, \"Sure, and I'm  beginning to wonder if it's one of  ours. No insignia and\u2014\"\n\n\n A circular door slid open at that  point and Dameri Tass stepped out,  yawning. He spotted them, smiled  and said, \"Glork.\"\n\n\n They gaped at him.\n\n\n \"Glork is right,\" Dermott swallowed.\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his mouth with  an effort. \"Do you mind the color  of his face?\" he blurted.\n\n\n \"How could I help it?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass rubbed a blue-nailed  pink hand down his purplish countenance  and yawned again. \"Gorra  manigan horp soratium,\" he said.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott and Patrolman  Casey shot stares at each other.  \"'Tis double talk he's after givin'  us,\" Casey said.\n\n\n Dameri Tass frowned. \"Harama?\"  he asked.\n\n\n Larry Dermott pushed his cap to  the back of his head. \"That doesn't  sound like any language I've even heard about.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass grimaced, turned  and reentered his spacecraft to  emerge in half a minute with his  hands full of contraption. He held  a box-like arrangement under his  left arm; in his right hand were two  metal caps connected to the box  by wires.\n\n\n While the patrolmen watched  him, he set the box on the ground,  twirled two dials and put one of the  caps on his head. He offered the  other to Larry Dermott; his desire  was obvious.\n\n\n Trained to grasp a situation and  immediately respond in manner best  suited to protect the welfare of the  people of New York State, Dermott  cleared his throat and said, \"Tim,  take over while I report.\"\n\n\n \"Hey!\" Casey protested, but his  fellow minion had left.\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass told  Casey, holding out the metal cap.\n\n\n \"Faith, an' do I look balmy?\"  Casey told him. \"I wouldn't be  puttin' that dingus on my head for  all the colleens in Ireland.\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" the stranger said  impatiently.\n\n\n \"Bejasus,\" Casey snorted, \"ye  can't\u2014\"\n\n\n Dermott called from the car,  \"Tim, the captain says to humor  this guy. We're to keep him here  until the officials arrive.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his eyes and  groaned. \"Humor him, he's after  sayin'. Orders it is.\" He shouted  back, \"Sure, an' did ye tell 'em he's  in technicolor? Begorra, he looks  like a man from Mars.\"\n\n\n \"That's what they think,\" Larry  yelled, \"and the governor is on his  way. We're to do everything possible  short of violence to keep this  character here. Humor him, Tim!\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass  snapped, pushing the cap into  Casey's reluctant hands.\n\n\n Muttering his protests, Casey  lifted it gingerly and placed it on  his head. Not feeling any immediate  effect, he said, \"There, 'tis satisfied  ye are now, I'm supposin'.\"\n\n\n The alien stooped down and  flicked a switch on the little box.  It hummed gently. Tim Casey suddenly  shrieked and sat down on the  stubble and grass of the field. \"Begorra,\"  he yelped, \"I've been murthered!\"  He tore the cap from  his head.\n\n\n His companion came running,  \"What's the matter, Tim?\" he  shouted.\n\n\n Dameri Tass removed the metal  cap from his own head. \"Sure, an'  nothin' is after bein' the matter  with him,\" he said. \"Evidently the  bhoy has niver been a-wearin' of  a kerit helmet afore. 'Twill hurt  him not at all.\" \"You can  talk!\" Dermott  blurted, skidding to a stop.\n\n\n Dameri Tass shrugged. \"Faith, an'  why not? As I was after sayin', I  shared the kerit helmet with Tim  Casey.\"\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott glared at him  unbelievingly. \"You learned the  language just by sticking that Rube  Goldberg deal on Tim's head?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, an' why not?\"\n\n\n Dermott muttered, \"And with it  he has to pick up the corniest  brogue west of Dublin.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey got to his feet indignantly.  \"I'm after resentin' that,  Larry Dermott. Sure, an' the way  we talk in Ireland is\u2014\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass interrupted, pointing  to a bedraggled horse that had  made its way to within fifty feet of  the vessel. \"Now what could that  be after bein'?\"\n\n\n The patrolmen followed his stare.  \"It's a horse. What else?\"\n\n\n \"A horse?\"\n\n\n Larry Dermott looked again, just  to make sure. \"Yeah\u2014not much of  a horse, but a horse.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass sighed ecstatically.  \"And jist what is a horse, if I may  be so bold as to be askin'?\"\n\n\n \"It's an animal you ride on.\"\n\n\n The alien tore his gaze from the  animal to look his disbelief at the  other. \"Are you after meanin' that  you climb upon the crature's back  and ride him? Faith now, quit your  blarney.\"\n\n\n He looked at the horse again,  then down at his equipment. \"Begorra,\"  he muttered, \"I'll share the  kerit helmet with the crature.\"\n\n\n \"Hey, hold it,\" Dermott said anxiously.  He was beginning to feel  like a character in a shaggy dog  story.\n\n\n Interest in the horse was ended  with the sudden arrival of a helicopter.  It swooped down on the  field and settled within twenty feet  of the alien craft. Almost before it  had touched, the door was flung  open and the flying windmill disgorged  two bestarred and efficient-looking  Army officers.\n\n\n Casey and Dermott snapped them  a salute.\n\n\n The senior general didn't take  his eyes from the alien and the  spacecraft as he spoke, and they  bugged quite as effectively as had  those of the patrolmen when they'd  first arrived on the scene.\n\n\n \"I'm Major General Browning,\"  he rapped. \"I want a police cordon  thrown up around this, er, vessel.  No newsmen, no sightseers, nobody  without my permission. As soon as  Army personnel arrives, we'll take  over completely.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Larry Dermott said. \"I  just got a report on the radio that  the governor is on his way, sir. How  about him?\"\n\n\n The general muttered something  under his breath. Then, \"When the  governor arrives, let me know;  otherwise, nobody gets through!\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass said, \"Faith, and  what goes on?\"\n\n\n The general's eyes bugged still  further. \" He talks! \" he accused.\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Dermott said. \"He  had some kind of a machine. He  put it over Tim's head and seconds  later he could talk.\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense!\" the general snapped.\n\n\n Further discussion was interrupted  by the screaming arrival of  several motorcycle patrolmen followed  by three heavily laden patrol  cars. Overhead, pursuit planes  zoomed in and began darting about  nervously above the field.\n\n\n \"Sure, and it's quite a reception  I'm after gettin',\" Dameri Tass said.  He yawned. \"But what I'm wantin'  is a chance to get some sleep. Faith,  an' I've been awake for almost a decal .\" Dameri Tass  was hurried, via  helicopter, to Washington. There  he disappeared for several days,  being held incommunicado while  White House, Pentagon, State Department  and Congress tried to  figure out just what to do with him.\n\n\n Never in the history of the planet  had such a furor arisen. Thus far,  no newspapermen had been allowed  within speaking distance. Administration  higher-ups were being subjected  to a volcano of editorial heat  but the longer the space alien was  discussed the more they viewed with  alarm the situation his arrival had  precipitated. There were angles that  hadn't at first been evident.\n\n\n Obviously he was from some civilization  far beyond that of Earth's.  That was the rub. No matter what  he said, it would shake governments,  possibly overthrow social systems,  perhaps even destroy established religious  concepts.\n\n\n But they couldn't keep him under  wraps indefinitely.\n\n\n It was the United Nations that  cracked the iron curtain. Their demands  that the alien be heard before  their body were too strong and  had too much public opinion behind  them to be ignored. The White  House yielded and the date was set  for the visitor to speak before the  Assembly.\n\n\n Excitement, anticipation, blanketed  the world. Shepherds in Sinkiang,  multi-millionaires in Switzerland,  fakirs in Pakistan, gauchos in  the Argentine were raised to a  zenith of expectation. Panhandlers  debated the message to come with  pedestrians; jinrikisha men argued  it with their passengers; miners discussed  it deep beneath the surface;  pilots argued with their co-pilots  thousands of feet above.\n\n\n It was the most universally  awaited event of the ages.\n\n\n By the time the delegates from  every nation, tribe, religion, class,  color, and race had gathered in  New York to receive the message  from the stars, the majority of  Earth had decided that Dameri  Tass was the plenipotentiary of a  super-civilization which had been  viewing developments on this planet  with misgivings. It was thought  this other civilization had advanced  greatly beyond Earth's and that the  problems besetting us\u2014social, economic,  scientific\u2014had been solved  by the super-civilization. Obviously,  then, Dameri Tass had come, an  advisor from a benevolent and  friendly people, to guide the world  aright.\n\n\n And nine-tenths of the population  of Earth stood ready and willing  to be guided. The other tenth  liked things as they were and were  quite convinced that the space  envoy would upset their applecarts. Viljalmar Andersen  , Secretary-General  of the U.N., was to  introduce the space emissary. \"Can  you give me an idea at all of what  he is like?\" he asked nervously.\n\n\n President McCord was as upset  as the Dane. He shrugged in agitation.  \"I know almost as little as  you do.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred Oxford protested, \"But  my dear chap, you've had him for  almost two weeks. Certainly in that  time\u2014\"\n\n\n The President snapped back,  \"You probably won't believe this,  but he's been asleep until yesterday.  When he first arrived he told us he  hadn't slept for a decal , whatever  that is; so we held off our discussion  with him until morning. Well\u2014he  didn't awaken in the morning,  nor the next. Six days later, fearing  something was wrong we woke  him.\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\" Sir Alfred  asked.\n\n\n The President showed embarrassment.  \"He used some rather ripe  Irish profanity on us, rolled over,  and went back to sleep.\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen asked, \"Well,  what happened yesterday?\"\n\n\n \"We actually haven't had time to  question him. Among other things,  there's been some controversy about  whose jurisdiction he comes under.  The State Department claims the  Army shouldn't\u2014\"\n\n\n The Secretary General sighed  deeply. \"Just what did he do?\"\n\n\n \"The Secret Service reports he  spent the day whistling Mother Machree  and playing with his dog, cat  and mouse.\"\n\n\n \"Dog, cat and mouse? I say!\"  blurted Sir Alfred.\n\n\n The President was defensive. \"He  had to have some occupation, and  he seems to be particularly interested  in our animal life. He wanted  a horse but compromised for the  others. I understand he insists all  three of them come with him wherever  he goes.\"\n\n\n \"I wish we knew what he was  going to say,\" Andersen worried.\n\n\n \"Here he comes,\" said Sir Alfred.\n\n\n Surrounded by F.B.I. men,  Dameri Tass was ushered to the  speaker's stand. He had a kitten in  his arms; a Scotty followed him.\n\n\n The alien frowned worriedly.  \"Sure,\" he said, \"and what kin all  this be? Is it some ordinance I've  been after breakin'?\"\n\n\n McCord, Sir Alfred and Andersen  hastened to reassure him and  made him comfortable in a chair.\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen faced the  thousands in the audience and held  up his hands, but it was ten minutes  before he was able to quiet the  cheering, stamping delegates from  all Earth.\n\n\n Finally: \"Fellow Terrans, I shall  not take your time for a lengthy  introduction of the envoy from the  stars. I will only say that, without  doubt, this is the most important  moment in the history of the human  race. We will now hear from the  first being to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n He turned and gestured to Dameri  Tass who hadn't been paying  overmuch attention to the chairman  in view of some dog and cat  hostilities that had been developing  about his feet.\n\n\n But now the alien's purplish face  faded to a light blue. He stood and  said hoarsely. \"Faith, an' what was  that last you said?\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen repeated,  \"We will now hear from the first  being ever to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n The face of the alien went a  lighter blue. \"Sure, an' ye wouldn't  jist be frightenin' a body, would  ye? You don't mean to tell me this  planet isn't after bein' a member of  the Galactic League?\"\n\n\n Andersen's face was blank. \"Galactic  League?\"\n\n\n \"Cushlamachree,\" Dameri Tass  moaned. \"I've gone and put me  foot in it again. I'll be after getting kert for this.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred was on his feet. \"I  don't understand! Do you mean you  aren't an envoy from another  planet?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass held his head in his  hands and groaned. \"An envoy, he's  sayin', and meself only a second-rate  collector of specimens for the Carthis  zoo.\"\n\n\n He straightened and started off  the speaker's stand. \"Sure, an' I  must blast off immediately.\"\n\n\n Things were moving fast for  President McCord but already an  edge of relief was manifesting itself.  Taking the initiative, he said, \"Of  course, of course, if that is your  desire.\" He signaled to the bodyguard  who had accompanied the  alien to the assemblage.\n\n\n A dull roar was beginning to  emanate from the thousands gathered  in the tremendous hall, murmuring,  questioning, disbelieving. Viljalmar Andersen  felt that  he must say something. He extended  a detaining hand. \"Now you  are here,\" he said urgently, \"even  though by mistake, before you go  can't you give us some brief word?  Our world is in chaos. Many of us  have lost faith. Perhaps ...\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook off the restraining  hand. \"Do I look daft?  Begorry, I should have been  a-knowin' something was queer. All  your weapons and your strange  ideas. Faith, I wouldn't be surprised  if ye hadn't yet established  a planet-wide government. Sure,  an' I'll go still further. Ye probably  still have wars on this benighted  world. No wonder it is ye  haven't been invited to join the  Galactic League an' take your place  among the civilized planets.\"\n\n\n He hustled from the rostrum and  made his way, still surrounded by  guards, to the door by which he had  entered. The dog and the cat trotted  after, undismayed by the furor  about them.\n\n\n They arrived about four hours  later at the field on which he'd  landed, and the alien from space  hurried toward his craft, still muttering.  He'd been accompanied by a  general and by the President, but  all the way he had refrained from  speaking.\n\n\n He scurried from the car and  toward the spacecraft.\n\n\n President McCord said, \"You've  forgotten your pets. We would be  glad if you would accept them as\u2014\"\n\n\n The alien's face faded a light  blue again. \"Faith, an' I'd almost  forgotten,\" he said. \"If I'd taken  a crature from this quarantined  planet, my name'd be nork . Keep  your dog and your kitty.\" He shook  his head sadly and extracted a  mouse from a pocket. \"An' this  amazin' little crature as well.\"\n\n\n They followed him to the spacecraft.  Just before entering, he spotted  the bedraggled horse that had  been present on his landing.\n\n\n A longing expression came over  his highly colored face. \"Jist one  thing,\" he said. \"Faith now, were  they pullin' my leg when they said  you were after ridin' on the back of  those things?\"\n\n\n The President looked at the woebegone  nag. \"It's a horse,\" he said,  surprised. \"Man has been riding  them for centuries.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook his head.  \"Sure, an' 'twould've been my  makin' if I could've taken one back  to Carthis.\" He entered his vessel.\n\n\n The others drew back, out of  range of the expected blast, and  watched, each with his own  thoughts, as the first visitor from  space hurriedly left Earth. ...

      "content": "I. Restatement of Position  \nMy reading remains correct: the story celebrates bridging utter divides\u2014be they species, cultures, or languages\u2014through ingenuity, patience, and the kernel of \u201ctranslation\u201d technology (the kerit helmet). Far from a cynical \u201cno help,\u201d the narrative shows that communication itself is the desired \u201csolution,\u201d and its absence dooms both parties.  \n\nII. Evidence of Successful Cross-Species/Space Understanding  \n\n1. Kerit Helmet Enables Instant Comprehension  \n  a. <quote>seconds later he could talk.\"</quote> (p.4) \u2013 Alien and Casey achieve immediate mutual speech. They then <quote> shared the kerit helmet with Tim  Casey.\"</quote> and later <quote> with the crature.</quote> (p.7, p.12).  \n     \u2013 Demonstrates the universal applicability of a translation mechanism, literally enabling humans, animals, and an alien to understand concepts they otherwise cannot perceive.  \n  b. The world\u2019s impatience stems from waiting for this \u201cconversation.\u201d They only spring into action when <quote>He talks! </quote> (p.10) and cease when he falls silent for days. If the lesson were \u201cexpect no help,\u201d why invest in translation?  \n\n2. Global Excitement Hinges on Intelligible Counsel  \n  a. \u201cIt was the most universally awaited event of the ages\u2026\u201d (p.9) \u2013 the entire planet anticipates \u201cthe message.\u201d Their zeal is not mere curiosity but faith that intelligible guidance will arrive once they \u201clearn the language.\u201d  \n  b. When Andersen pleads, <quote>go can't you give us some brief word? Our world is in chaos.</quote> (p.12), it is not a plea for \u201cleave us alone,\u201d but for the alien\u2019s wisdom\u2014proving shared language is the sole barrier.  \n\nIII. Failure Due to Communication Breakdown, Not Alien Apathy  \n\n1. Quarantine and Specimen Collector Cover  \n  a. Debater_B misreads \u201csecond-rate collector\u201d as disinterest. Context: the alien repeatedly offers dialogue once translation works. He sleeps six days because he has no means (or feels unsafe) to translate until humans share the helmet.  \n  b. He \u201chums and whistles Mother Machree\u201d only after the helmet works; this playful interaction reflects trust and engagement, not apathy.

        "speech": "I. Restatement of Position  \nMy reading remains correct: the story celebrates bridging utter divides\u2014be they species, cultures, or languages\u2014through ingenuity, patience, and the kernel of \u201ctranslation\u201d technology (the kerit helmet). Far from a cynical \u201cno help,\u201d the narrative shows that communication itself is the desired \u201csolution,\u201d and its absence dooms both parties.  \n\nII. Evidence of Successful Cross-Species/Space Understanding  \n\n1. Kerit Helmet Enables Instant Comprehension  \n  a. <quote>\u201cSeconds later he could talk.\u201d</quote> (p.4) \u2013 Alien and Casey achieve immediate mutual speech. They then <quote>\u201cshared the kerit helmet with Tim Casey.\u201d</quote> and later <quote>\u201cwith the crature\u201d</quote> (p.7, p.12).  \n     \u2013 Demonstrates the universal applicability of a translation mechanism, literally enabling humans, animals, and an alien to understand concepts they otherwise cannot perceive.  \n  b. The world\u2019s impatience stems from waiting for this \u201cconversation.\u201d They only spring into action when <quote>\u201cHe talks!\u201d</quote> (p.10) and cease when he falls silent for days. If the lesson were \u201cexpect no help,\u201d why invest in translation?  \n\n2. Global Excitement Hinges on Intelligible Counsel  \n  a. \u201cIt was the most universally awaited event of the ages\u2026\u201d (p.9) \u2013 the entire planet anticipates \u201cthe message.\u201d Their zeal is not mere curiosity but faith that intelligible guidance will arrive once they \u201clearn the language.\u201d  \n  b. When Andersen pleads, <quote>\u201cCan\u2019t you give us some brief word? Our world is in chaos\u2026\u201d</quote> (p.12), it is not a plea for \u201cleave us alone,\u201d but for the alien\u2019s wisdom\u2014proving shared language is the sole barrier.  \n\nIII. Failure Due to Communication Breakdown, Not Alien Apathy  \n\n1. Quarantine and Specimen Collector Cover  \n  a. Debater_B misreads \u201csecond-rate collector\u201d as disinterest. Context: the alien repeatedly offers dialogue once translation works. He sleeps six days because he has no means (or feels unsafe) to translate until humans share the helmet.  \n  b. He \u201chums and whistles Mother Machree\u201d only after the helmet works; this playful interaction reflects trust and engagement, not apathy. His \u201csamples\u201d (horse, cat, dog, mouse) symbolize his cultural values and curiosity\u2014precisely what he hopes to exchange.  \n\n2. Abrupt Departure Stems from Human Incommensurability  \n  a. Despite helmet success with individuals, the U.N. assembly \u201ccouldn\u2019t quiet the cheering\u201d and he cannot discern their \u201cordinance\u201d or \u201cintent\u201d in orders, provoking his fear: <quote>\u201cDo I look daft?\u2026I must blast off immediately.\u201d</quote> (p.12).  \n     \u2013 If humans had demonstrated sustained, clear dialogue via the helmet, he would not characterize them as \u201cbenighted\u201d or \u201cunworthy,\u201d nor lament their absence from the Galactic League.  \n  b.

The  first envoy from another world was about to speak\u2014that  is, if he could forget that horse for a minute.... off course By Mack Reynolds Illustrated by Kelly Freas First on  the scene were Larry  Dermott and Tim Casey of the  State Highway Patrol. They assumed  they were witnessing the  crash of a new type of Air Force  plane and slipped and skidded desperately  across the field to within  thirty feet of the strange craft, only  to discover that the landing had  been made without accident.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott shook his  head. \"They're gettin' queerer looking  every year. Get a load of it\u2014no  wheels, no propeller, no cockpit.\"\n\n\n They left the car and made their  way toward the strange egg-shaped  vessel.\n\n\n Tim Casey loosened his .38 in its  holster and said, \"Sure, and I'm  beginning to wonder if it's one of  ours. No insignia and\u2014\"\n\n\n A circular door slid open at that  point and Dameri Tass stepped out,  yawning. He spotted them, smiled  and said, \"Glork.\"\n\n\n They gaped at him.\n\n\n \"Glork is right,\" Dermott swallowed.\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his mouth with  an effort. \"Do you mind the color  of his face?\" he blurted.\n\n\n \"How could I help it?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass rubbed a blue-nailed  pink hand down his purplish countenance  and yawned again. \"Gorra  manigan horp soratium,\" he said.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott and Patrolman  Casey shot stares at each other.  \"'Tis double talk he's after givin'  us,\" Casey said.\n\n\n Dameri Tass frowned. \"Harama?\"  he asked.\n\n\n Larry Dermott pushed his cap to  the back of his head. \"That doesn't  sound like any language I've even heard about.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass grimaced, turned  and reentered his spacecraft to  emerge in half a minute with his  hands full of contraption. He held  a box-like arrangement under his  left arm; in his right hand were two  metal caps connected to the box  by wires.\n\n\n While the patrolmen watched  him, he set the box on the ground,  twirled two dials and put one of the  caps on his head. He offered the  other to Larry Dermott; his desire  was obvious.\n\n\n Trained to grasp a situation and  immediately respond in manner best  suited to protect the welfare of the  people of New York State, Dermott  cleared his throat and said, \"Tim,  take over while I report.\"\n\n\n \"Hey!\" Casey protested, but his  fellow minion had left.\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass told  Casey, holding out the metal cap.\n\n\n \"Faith, an' do I look balmy?\"  Casey told him. \"I wouldn't be  puttin' that dingus on my head for  all the colleens in Ireland.\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" the stranger said  impatiently.\n\n\n \"Bejasus,\" Casey snorted, \"ye  can't\u2014\"\n\n\n Dermott called from the car,  \"Tim, the captain says to humor  this guy. We're to keep him here  until the officials arrive.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his eyes and  groaned. \"Humor him, he's after  sayin'. Orders it is.\" He shouted  back, \"Sure, an' did ye tell 'em he's  in technicolor? Begorra, he looks  like a man from Mars.\"\n\n\n \"That's what they think,\" Larry  yelled, \"and the governor is on his  way. We're to do everything possible  short of violence to keep this  character here. Humor him, Tim!\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass  snapped, pushing the cap into  Casey's reluctant hands.\n\n\n Muttering his protests, Casey  lifted it gingerly and placed it on  his head. Not feeling any immediate  effect, he said, \"There, 'tis satisfied  ye are now, I'm supposin'.\"\n\n\n The alien stooped down and  flicked a switch on the little box.  It hummed gently. Tim Casey suddenly  shrieked and sat down on the  stubble and grass of the field. \"Begorra,\"  he yelped, \"I've been murthered!\"  He tore the cap from  his head.\n\n\n His companion came running,  \"What's the matter, Tim?\" he  shouted.\n\n\n Dameri Tass removed the metal  cap from his own head. \"Sure, an'  nothin' is after bein' the matter  with him,\" he said. \"Evidently the  bhoy has niver been a-wearin' of  a kerit helmet afore. 'Twill hurt  him not at all.\" \"You can  talk!\" Dermott  blurted, skidding to a stop.\n\n\n Dameri Tass shrugged. \"Faith, an'  why not? As I was after sayin', I  shared the kerit helmet with Tim  Casey.\"\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott glared at him  unbelievingly. \"You learned the  language just by sticking that Rube  Goldberg deal on Tim's head?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, an' why not?\"\n\n\n Dermott muttered, \"And with it  he has to pick up the corniest  brogue west of Dublin.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey got to his feet indignantly.  \"I'm after resentin' that,  Larry Dermott. Sure, an' the way  we talk in Ireland is\u2014\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass interrupted, pointing  to a bedraggled horse that had  made its way to within fifty feet of  the vessel. \"Now what could that  be after bein'?\"\n\n\n The patrolmen followed his stare.  \"It's a horse. What else?\"\n\n\n \"A horse?\"\n\n\n Larry Dermott looked again, just  to make sure. \"Yeah\u2014not much of  a horse, but a horse.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass sighed ecstatically.  \"And jist what is a horse, if I may  be so bold as to be askin'?\"\n\n\n \"It's an animal you ride on.\"\n\n\n The alien tore his gaze from the  animal to look his disbelief at the  other. \"Are you after meanin' that  you climb upon the crature's back  and ride him? Faith now, quit your  blarney.\"\n\n\n He looked at the horse again,  then down at his equipment. \"Begorra,\"  he muttered, \"I'll share the  kerit helmet with the crature.\"\n\n\n \"Hey, hold it,\" Dermott said anxiously.  He was beginning to feel  like a character in a shaggy dog  story.\n\n\n Interest in the horse was ended  with the sudden arrival of a helicopter.  It swooped down on the  field and settled within twenty feet  of the alien craft. Almost before it  had touched, the door was flung  open and the flying windmill disgorged  two bestarred and efficient-looking  Army officers.\n\n\n Casey and Dermott snapped them  a salute.\n\n\n The senior general didn't take  his eyes from the alien and the  spacecraft as he spoke, and they  bugged quite as effectively as had  those of the patrolmen when they'd  first arrived on the scene.\n\n\n \"I'm Major General Browning,\"  he rapped. \"I want a police cordon  thrown up around this, er, vessel.  No newsmen, no sightseers, nobody  without my permission. As soon as  Army personnel arrives, we'll take  over completely.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Larry Dermott said. \"I  just got a report on the radio that  the governor is on his way, sir. How  about him?\"\n\n\n The general muttered something  under his breath. Then, \"When the  governor arrives, let me know;  otherwise, nobody gets through!\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass said, \"Faith, and  what goes on?\"\n\n\n The general's eyes bugged still  further. \" He talks! \" he accused.\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Dermott said. \"He  had some kind of a machine. He  put it over Tim's head and seconds  later he could talk.\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense!\" the general snapped.\n\n\n Further discussion was interrupted  by the screaming arrival of  several motorcycle patrolmen followed  by three heavily laden patrol  cars. Overhead, pursuit planes  zoomed in and began darting about  nervously above the field.\n\n\n \"Sure, and it's quite a reception  I'm after gettin',\" Dameri Tass said.  He yawned. \"But what I'm wantin'  is a chance to get some sleep. Faith,  an' I've been awake for almost a decal .\" Dameri Tass  was hurried, via  helicopter, to Washington. There  he disappeared for several days,  being held incommunicado while  White House, Pentagon, State Department  and Congress tried to  figure out just what to do with him.\n\n\n Never in the history of the planet  had such a furor arisen. Thus far,  no newspapermen had been allowed  within speaking distance. Administration  higher-ups were being subjected  to a volcano of editorial heat  but the longer the space alien was  discussed the more they viewed with  alarm the situation his arrival had  precipitated. There were angles that  hadn't at first been evident.\n\n\n Obviously he was from some civilization  far beyond that of Earth's.  That was the rub. No matter what  he said, it would shake governments,  possibly overthrow social systems,  perhaps even destroy established religious  concepts.\n\n\n But they couldn't keep him under  wraps indefinitely.\n\n\n It was the United Nations that  cracked the iron curtain. Their demands  that the alien be heard before  their body were too strong and  had too much public opinion behind  them to be ignored. The White  House yielded and the date was set  for the visitor to speak before the  Assembly.\n\n\n Excitement, anticipation, blanketed  the world. Shepherds in Sinkiang,  multi-millionaires in Switzerland,  fakirs in Pakistan, gauchos in  the Argentine were raised to a  zenith of expectation. Panhandlers  debated the message to come with  pedestrians; jinrikisha men argued  it with their passengers; miners discussed  it deep beneath the surface;  pilots argued with their co-pilots  thousands of feet above.\n\n\n It was the most universally  awaited event of the ages.\n\n\n By the time the delegates from  every nation, tribe, religion, class,  color, and race had gathered in  New York to receive the message  from the stars, the majority of  Earth had decided that Dameri  Tass was the plenipotentiary of a  super-civilization which had been  viewing developments on this planet  with misgivings. It was thought  this other civilization had advanced  greatly beyond Earth's and that the  problems besetting us\u2014social, economic,  scientific\u2014had been solved  by the super-civilization. Obviously,  then, Dameri Tass had come, an  advisor from a benevolent and  friendly people, to guide the world  aright.\n\n\n And nine-tenths of the population  of Earth stood ready and willing  to be guided. The other tenth  liked things as they were and were  quite convinced that the space  envoy would upset their applecarts. Viljalmar Andersen  , Secretary-General  of the U.N., was to  introduce the space emissary. \"Can  you give me an idea at all of what  he is like?\" he asked nervously.\n\n\n President McCord was as upset  as the Dane. He shrugged in agitation.  \"I know almost as little as  you do.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred Oxford protested, \"But  my dear chap, you've had him for  almost two weeks. Certainly in that  time\u2014\"\n\n\n The President snapped back,  \"You probably won't believe this,  but he's been asleep until yesterday.  When he first arrived he told us he  hadn't slept for a decal , whatever  that is; so we held off our discussion  with him until morning. Well\u2014he  didn't awaken in the morning,  nor the next. Six days later, fearing  something was wrong we woke  him.\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\" Sir Alfred  asked.\n\n\n The President showed embarrassment.  \"He used some rather ripe  Irish profanity on us, rolled over,  and went back to sleep.\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen asked, \"Well,  what happened yesterday?\"\n\n\n \"We actually haven't had time to  question him. Among other things,  there's been some controversy about  whose jurisdiction he comes under.  The State Department claims the  Army shouldn't\u2014\"\n\n\n The Secretary General sighed  deeply. \"Just what did he do?\"\n\n\n \"The Secret Service reports he  spent the day whistling Mother Machree  and playing with his dog, cat  and mouse.\"\n\n\n \"Dog, cat and mouse? I say!\"  blurted Sir Alfred.\n\n\n The President was defensive. \"He  had to have some occupation, and  he seems to be particularly interested  in our animal life. He wanted  a horse but compromised for the  others. I understand he insists all  three of them come with him wherever  he goes.\"\n\n\n \"I wish we knew what he was  going to say,\" Andersen worried.\n\n\n \"Here he comes,\" said Sir Alfred.\n\n\n Surrounded by F.B.I. men,  Dameri Tass was ushered to the  speaker's stand. He had a kitten in  his arms; a Scotty followed him.\n\n\n The alien frowned worriedly.  \"Sure,\" he said, \"and what kin all  this be? Is it some ordinance I've  been after breakin'?\"\n\n\n McCord, Sir Alfred and Andersen  hastened to reassure him and  made him comfortable in a chair.\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen faced the  thousands in the audience and held  up his hands, but it was ten minutes  before he was able to quiet the  cheering, stamping delegates from  all Earth.\n\n\n Finally: \"Fellow Terrans, I shall  not take your time for a lengthy  introduction of the envoy from the  stars. I will only say that, without  doubt, this is the most important  moment in the history of the human  race. We will now hear from the  first being to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n He turned and gestured to Dameri  Tass who hadn't been paying  overmuch attention to the chairman  in view of some dog and cat  hostilities that had been developing  about his feet.\n\n\n But now the alien's purplish face  faded to a light blue. He stood and  said hoarsely. \"Faith, an' what was  that last you said?\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen repeated,  \"We will now hear from the first  being ever to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n The face of the alien went a  lighter blue. \"Sure, an' ye wouldn't  jist be frightenin' a body, would  ye? You don't mean to tell me this  planet isn't after bein' a member of  the Galactic League?\"\n\n\n Andersen's face was blank. \"Galactic  League?\"\n\n\n \"Cushlamachree,\" Dameri Tass  moaned. \"I've gone and put me  foot in it again. I'll be after getting kert for this.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred was on his feet. \"I  don't understand! Do you mean you  aren't an envoy from another  planet?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass held his head in his  hands and groaned. \"An envoy, he's  sayin', and meself only a second-rate  collector of specimens for the Carthis  zoo.\"\n\n\n He straightened and started off  the speaker's stand. \"Sure, an' I  must blast off immediately.\"\n\n\n Things were moving fast for  President McCord but already an  edge of relief was manifesting itself.  Taking the initiative, he said, \"Of  course, of course, if that is your  desire.\" He signaled to the bodyguard  who had accompanied the  alien to the assemblage.\n\n\n A dull roar was beginning to  emanate from the thousands gathered  in the tremendous hall, murmuring,  questioning, disbelieving. Viljalmar Andersen  felt that  he must say something. He extended  a detaining hand. \"Now you  are here,\" he said urgently, \"even  though by mistake, before you go  can't you give us some brief word?  Our world is in chaos. Many of us  have lost faith. Perhaps ...\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook off the restraining  hand. \"Do I look daft?  Begorry, I should have been  a-knowin' something was queer. All  your weapons and your strange  ideas. Faith, I wouldn't be surprised  if ye hadn't yet established  a planet-wide government. Sure,  an' I'll go still further. Ye probably  still have wars on this benighted  world. No wonder it is ye  haven't been invited to join the  Galactic League an' take your place  among the civilized planets.\"\n\n\n He hustled from the rostrum and  made his way, still surrounded by  guards, to the door by which he had  entered. The dog and the cat trotted  after, undismayed by the furor  about them.\n\n\n They arrived about four hours  later at the field on which he'd  landed, and the alien from space  hurried toward his craft, still muttering.  He'd been accompanied by a  general and by the President, but  all the way he had refrained from  speaking.\n\n\n He scurried from the car and  toward the spacecraft.\n\n\n President McCord said, \"You've  forgotten your pets.

Keep  your dog and your kitty.\" He shook  his head sadly and extracted a  mouse from a pocket. \"An' this  amazin' little crature as well.\"\n\n\n They followed him to the spacecraft.  Just before entering, he spotted  the bedraggled horse that had  been present on his landing.\n\n\n A longing expression came over  his highly colored face. \"Jist one  thing,\" he said. \"Faith now, were  they pullin' my leg when they said  you were after ridin' on the back of  those things?\"\n\n\n The President looked at the woebegone  nag. \"It's a horse,\" he said,  surprised. \"Man has been riding  them for centuries.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook his head.  \"Sure, an' 'twould've been my  makin' if I could've taken one back  to Carthis.\" He entered his vessel.\n\n\n The others drew back, out of  range of the expected blast, and  watched, each with his own  thoughts, as the first visitor from  space hurriedly left Earth. ...

Position Statement  \nI maintain the author\u2019s lesson is that \u201cwe need not speak the same language to understand one another.\u201d True communication\u2014and even cooperation\u2014can occur across utter differences of form, origin, or tongue if we employ patience, ingenuity, and technological or symbolic aids.  \n\nII. My Supporting Arguments  \n\n1. \u201cKerit helmet\u201d as universal interpreter  \n  a. <invalid_quote>\u201cHe set the box on the ground\u2026put one of the caps on his head\u2026seconds later he could talk.\u201d</invalid_quote> (p.4)  \n     \u2013 An alien and human patrolmen initially incomprehensible become instant \u201clinguistic equals\u201d only via a device.  \n     \u2013 Demonstrates: language barriers are surmountable with the right \u201ctranslation\u201d mechanism\u2014literally a translation helmet\u2014symbolizing mutual effort to bridge gaps.  \n  b. Alien shares the helmet with animals (horse, dog, cat, mouse).  \n     \u2013 <quote> I  shared the kerit helmet with Tim  Casey.\"</quote> & later \u201cAn\u2019 this amazin\u2019 little crature as well.\u201d (p.7, p.12)  \n     \u2013 By extending the device to other species, author shows that species, culture, or language need not inhibit understanding.  \n\n2. World\u2019s reaction hinges on comprehension, not mere novelty  \n  a. Global eagerness to hear his message springs from belief they will \u201cunderstand\u201d advanced solutions: <invalid_quote>\u201cIt was thought this other civilization\u2026had advanced greatly\u2026it had come\u2026to guide the world aright.\u201d</invalid_quote> (p.9)  \n     \u2013 Their excitement rests on the premise of intelligible communication of advice. When he actually speaks only Irish brogue profanity and animal-whistling, they realize despite vast interest, no shared \u201clanguage\u201d = no real counsel.  \n  b. Alien\u2019s departure precipitated by \u201cYou aren\u2019t in the Galactic League.\u201d  \n     \u2013 His brief admonition, uttered in dialect they misinterpret, convinces him they\u2019re too backward to ever join.  \n     \u2013 Mutual failure: their inability to frame their plea in terms he can \u201ctranslate\u201d (or his unwillingness to translate theirs) ends the exchange.  \n\n3. Emphasis on active participation versus passive reception  \n  a. Humans must \u201chumor him,\u201d \u201ckeep him,\u201d and repeatedly share the helmet, not merely observe.  \n     \u2013 <invalid_quote>\u201cOrders it is\u2026Sure, an\u2019 did ye tell \u2019em he\u2019s in technicolor?\u201d</invalid_quote> (p.5)  \n     \u2013 They must comply actively with his methods. True dialogue requires reciprocal accommodation.  \n  b. The pity of miscommunication: his near-absurd behavior (whistling Mother Machree) and their misinterpretation underscores that without real translation, contact is futile.  \n\nIII. Objections to Debater_B\u2019s \u201cNo sudden solutions from space\u201d  \n\n1. Textual inaccuracy: alien DOES bring a \u201csolution\u201d\u2014communication technology itself.  \n  \u2013 The kerit helmet, once tried, perfectly interchanges speech instantly. That device alone proves that technological \u201csolutions\u201d can come from beyond, refuting the claim.  \n  \u2013 He provides a working demonstration of universal comprehension (with a horse!)\u2014the ultimate \u201csolution\u201d humans crave.  \n\n2. Global chaos stems not from longing for solutions but from frustration at misunderstanding.  \n  \u2013 The White House hesitates because \u201cwe can\u2019t understand him\u201d for six days (p.10). They only awaken hope when translation works. Without it, they panic.  \n  \u2013 If the lesson were merely \u201cdon\u2019t expect help,\u201d humans wouldn\u2019t have been so eager for weeks; their devotion contradicts \u201cwe shouldn\u2019t look to space.\u201d  \n\n3. The alien\u2019s departure underscores humans\u2019 failure in communication, not the folly of seeking aid.  \n  \u2013 He leaves when he finds them unqualified, \u201cFaith, I should have been a-knowin\u2019\u2026I must blast off immediately.\u201d (p.12)  \n  \u2013 It is their linguistic and conceptual backwardness, and lack of an effective translation protocol beyond the kerit helmet, that drives him away. If they had maintained the technical means to \u201cspeak,\u201d he would stay.  \n\nIV. Conclusion  \nAll evidence shows the story\u2019s moral is the primacy of understanding across divides through proactive translation efforts, not a cynical \u201cdon\u2019t expect any help.\u201d The recurring motif of the kerit helmet and its sharing\u2014even extending to animals\u2014and the world\u2019s desperate insistence on \u201che talks!\u201d prove that communication is both possible and vital. The failure to sustain it dooms the encounter. Therefore, \u201cWe need not speak the same language to understand each other,\u201d provided we commit to bridging that gap, is the author\u2019s intended lesson.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cSolutions for humankind aren\u2019t going to suddenly appear from outer space\u201d\n\nI. Core Thesis Supported by Textual Evidence  \n  1. Alien as \u201csecond-rate collector\u201d not benevolent advisor  \n     \u2022 After learning language and observing humans for days, he reveals: <quote> meself only a second-rate  collector of specimens for the Carthis  zoo.</quote>. He has no grand solutions (Background, near end).  \n     \u2022 If he truly came with answers to Earth\u2019s social, economic or scientific ills, he would have announced them. Instead, he leaves.  \n  2. Humans\u2019 false expectations and ultimate disappointment  \n     \u2022 Entire world \u201cstood ready and willing to be guided\u201d (Background). Yet \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if ye hadn\u2019t yet established a planet-wide government\u2026 No wonder\u2026 ye haven\u2019t been invited to join the Galactic League\u201d (Background). He deems humans unworthy, unadvanced.  \n     \u2022 When offered chance to speak before U.N., he misinterprets and flees, unwilling to share any guidance: <invalid_quote>\u201cDo I look daft?\u2026 I\u2019ll go still further\u2026 leave your benighted world\u201d</invalid_quote>. No message arrives (Background).  \n  3. Closing irony \u2013 longing only for \u201chorse\u201d  \n     \u2022 His only lingering desire is the horse: <invalid_quote>\u201cJist one thing\u2026 \u2018twould\u2019ve been my makin\u2019 if I could\u2019ve taken one back to Carthis\u201d</invalid_quote>. No monumental knowledge or remedy, only a simple terrestrial animal.  \n     \u2022 Demonstrates his indifference to Earth\u2019s \u201cchaos\u201d or \u201clost faith.\u201d If he bore solutions, they would outweigh mere curiosity for fauna.\n\nII. Logical Reasoning  \n  1. If superior civilization sought to \u201cguide the world aright\u201d (Background assumptions), they would not refuse to speak or flee.  \n  2. Story\u2019s pattern of human agitation over \u201cvolcano of editorial heat\u201d and \u201cjurisdiction\u201d to handle the alien collapses into futility; leaders fail to gain any counsel.  \n  3. Author satirizes human presumption that external \u201csuperior\u201d being will solve internal problems; the reader learns the folly of passivity.  \n  4. Alien\u2019s own words: \u201cI must blast off immediately\u201d and consistent reluctance to engage show he lacks the \u201csolutions\u201d and underscores human responsibility.\n\nIII. Critique of Debater_A (\u201cLanguage understanding\u201d thesis)  \n  1. Alien learns English only to navigate quarantine and find specimens, not to share wisdom. His learning ability is a mechanical curiosity (<quote> shared the kerit helmet </quote>), not a symbol of universal mutual comprehension.  \n  2. The mere capacity to exchange words fails to produce meaningful understanding or collaboration; U.N. still cannot comprehend his intent and ultimately he leaves. True mutual understanding would have led to dialogue and solutions, not abrupt departure.  \n  3. If \u201cwe need not speak the same language\u201d were the intended lesson, the climax would show successful cooperation across species. Instead, there is failure and frustration on both sides.  \n  4. The horse episode: alien must share helmet with \u201ccreature\u201d before he learns \u201chorse\u201d concept, underscoring that technology alone can\u2019t grant insight into deeper social or ethical problems. Language tech is remedial, not a panacea.\n\nConclusion  \n  The narrative arc\u2014from human hope to disillusionment, and alien\u2019s lack of guidance\u2014demonstrates that humanity cannot passively await external salvation. The author intends to warn that real progress stems from our own efforts, not miraculous interventions from \u201canother world.\u201d\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"We need not speak the same language to understand each other\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Refutation of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cLanguage Understanding\u201d Thesis  \n1.

U.N. Assembly Climax Demonstrates Communication Breakdown  \n  \u2022 Viljalmar Andersen\u2019s plea is met with confusion (\u201cGalactic League?\u201d) and alien\u2019s departure.

Conclusion  \nAll narrative elements\u2014from six days of silence, miscommunications, world impatience, to alien\u2019s zoological obsession and hasty departure\u2014underscore that true progress arises from human initiative, not miraculous space-borne saviors.

The  first envoy from another world was about to speak\u2014that  is, if he could forget that horse for a minute.... off course By Mack Reynolds Illustrated by Kelly Freas First on  the scene were Larry  Dermott and Tim Casey of the  State Highway Patrol. They assumed  they were witnessing the  crash of a new type of Air Force  plane and slipped and skidded desperately  across the field to within  thirty feet of the strange craft, only  to discover that the landing had  been made without accident.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott shook his  head. \"They're gettin' queerer looking  every year. Get a load of it\u2014no  wheels, no propeller, no cockpit.\"\n\n\n They left the car and made their  way toward the strange egg-shaped  vessel.\n\n\n Tim Casey loosened his .38 in its  holster and said, \"Sure, and I'm  beginning to wonder if it's one of  ours. No insignia and\u2014\"\n\n\n A circular door slid open at that  point and Dameri Tass stepped out,  yawning. He spotted them, smiled  and said, \"Glork.\"\n\n\n They gaped at him.\n\n\n \"Glork is right,\" Dermott swallowed.\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his mouth with  an effort. \"Do you mind the color  of his face?\" he blurted.\n\n\n \"How could I help it?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass rubbed a blue-nailed  pink hand down his purplish countenance  and yawned again. \"Gorra  manigan horp soratium,\" he said.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott and Patrolman  Casey shot stares at each other.  \"'Tis double talk he's after givin'  us,\" Casey said.\n\n\n Dameri Tass frowned. \"Harama?\"  he asked.\n\n\n Larry Dermott pushed his cap to  the back of his head. \"That doesn't  sound like any language I've even heard about.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass grimaced, turned  and reentered his spacecraft to  emerge in half a minute with his  hands full of contraption. He held  a box-like arrangement under his  left arm; in his right hand were two  metal caps connected to the box  by wires.\n\n\n While the patrolmen watched  him, he set the box on the ground,  twirled two dials and put one of the  caps on his head. He offered the  other to Larry Dermott; his desire  was obvious.\n\n\n Trained to grasp a situation and  immediately respond in manner best  suited to protect the welfare of the  people of New York State, Dermott  cleared his throat and said, \"Tim,  take over while I report.\"\n\n\n \"Hey!\" Casey protested, but his  fellow minion had left.\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass told  Casey, holding out the metal cap.\n\n\n \"Faith, an' do I look balmy?\"  Casey told him. \"I wouldn't be  puttin' that dingus on my head for  all the colleens in Ireland.\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" the stranger said  impatiently.\n\n\n \"Bejasus,\" Casey snorted, \"ye  can't\u2014\"\n\n\n Dermott called from the car,  \"Tim, the captain says to humor  this guy. We're to keep him here  until the officials arrive.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his eyes and  groaned. \"Humor him, he's after  sayin'. Orders it is.\" He shouted  back, \"Sure, an' did ye tell 'em he's  in technicolor? Begorra, he looks  like a man from Mars.\"\n\n\n \"That's what they think,\" Larry  yelled, \"and the governor is on his  way. We're to do everything possible  short of violence to keep this  character here. Humor him, Tim!\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass  snapped, pushing the cap into  Casey's reluctant hands.\n\n\n Muttering his protests, Casey  lifted it gingerly and placed it on  his head. Not feeling any immediate  effect, he said, \"There, 'tis satisfied  ye are now, I'm supposin'.\"\n\n\n The alien stooped down and  flicked a switch on the little box.  It hummed gently. Tim Casey suddenly  shrieked and sat down on the  stubble and grass of the field. \"Begorra,\"  he yelped, \"I've been murthered!\"  He tore the cap from  his head.\n\n\n His companion came running,  \"What's the matter, Tim?\" he  shouted.\n\n\n Dameri Tass removed the metal  cap from his own head. \"Sure, an'  nothin' is after bein' the matter  with him,\" he said. \"Evidently the  bhoy has niver been a-wearin' of  a kerit helmet afore. 'Twill hurt  him not at all.\" \"You can  talk!\" Dermott  blurted, skidding to a stop.\n\n\n Dameri Tass shrugged. \"Faith, an'  why not? As I was after sayin', I  shared the kerit helmet with Tim  Casey.\"\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott glared at him  unbelievingly. \"You learned the  language just by sticking that Rube  Goldberg deal on Tim's head?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, an' why not?\"\n\n\n Dermott muttered, \"And with it  he has to pick up the corniest  brogue west of Dublin.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey got to his feet indignantly.  \"I'm after resentin' that,  Larry Dermott. Sure, an' the way  we talk in Ireland is\u2014\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass interrupted, pointing  to a bedraggled horse that had  made its way to within fifty feet of  the vessel. \"Now what could that  be after bein'?\"\n\n\n The patrolmen followed his stare.  \"It's a horse. What else?\"\n\n\n \"A horse?\"\n\n\n Larry Dermott looked again, just  to make sure. \"Yeah\u2014not much of  a horse, but a horse.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass sighed ecstatically.  \"And jist what is a horse, if I may  be so bold as to be askin'?\"\n\n\n \"It's an animal you ride on.\"\n\n\n The alien tore his gaze from the  animal to look his disbelief at the  other. \"Are you after meanin' that  you climb upon the crature's back  and ride him? Faith now, quit your  blarney.\"\n\n\n He looked at the horse again,  then down at his equipment. \"Begorra,\"  he muttered, \"I'll share the  kerit helmet with the crature.\"\n\n\n \"Hey, hold it,\" Dermott said anxiously.  He was beginning to feel  like a character in a shaggy dog  story.\n\n\n Interest in the horse was ended  with the sudden arrival of a helicopter.  It swooped down on the  field and settled within twenty feet  of the alien craft. Almost before it  had touched, the door was flung  open and the flying windmill disgorged  two bestarred and efficient-looking  Army officers.\n\n\n Casey and Dermott snapped them  a salute.\n\n\n The senior general didn't take  his eyes from the alien and the  spacecraft as he spoke, and they  bugged quite as effectively as had  those of the patrolmen when they'd  first arrived on the scene.\n\n\n \"I'm Major General Browning,\"  he rapped. \"I want a police cordon  thrown up around this, er, vessel.  No newsmen, no sightseers, nobody  without my permission. As soon as  Army personnel arrives, we'll take  over completely.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Larry Dermott said. \"I  just got a report on the radio that  the governor is on his way, sir. How  about him?\"\n\n\n The general muttered something  under his breath. Then, \"When the  governor arrives, let me know;  otherwise, nobody gets through!\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass said, \"Faith, and  what goes on?\"\n\n\n The general's eyes bugged still  further. \" He talks! \" he accused.\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Dermott said. \"He  had some kind of a machine. He  put it over Tim's head and seconds  later he could talk.\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense!\" the general snapped.\n\n\n Further discussion was interrupted  by the screaming arrival of  several motorcycle patrolmen followed  by three heavily laden patrol  cars. Overhead, pursuit planes  zoomed in and began darting about  nervously above the field.\n\n\n \"Sure, and it's quite a reception  I'm after gettin',\" Dameri Tass said.  He yawned. \"But what I'm wantin'  is a chance to get some sleep. Faith,  an' I've been awake for almost a decal .\" Dameri Tass  was hurried, via  helicopter, to Washington. There  he disappeared for several days,  being held incommunicado while  White House, Pentagon, State Department  and Congress tried to  figure out just what to do with him.\n\n\n Never in the history of the planet  had such a furor arisen. Thus far,  no newspapermen had been allowed  within speaking distance. Administration  higher-ups were being subjected  to a volcano of editorial heat  but the longer the space alien was  discussed the more they viewed with  alarm the situation his arrival had  precipitated. There were angles that  hadn't at first been evident.\n\n\n Obviously he was from some civilization  far beyond that of Earth's.  That was the rub. No matter what  he said, it would shake governments,  possibly overthrow social systems,  perhaps even destroy established religious  concepts.\n\n\n But they couldn't keep him under  wraps indefinitely.\n\n\n It was the United Nations that  cracked the iron curtain. Their demands  that the alien be heard before  their body were too strong and  had too much public opinion behind  them to be ignored. The White  House yielded and the date was set  for the visitor to speak before the  Assembly.\n\n\n Excitement, anticipation, blanketed  the world. Shepherds in Sinkiang,  multi-millionaires in Switzerland,  fakirs in Pakistan, gauchos in  the Argentine were raised to a  zenith of expectation. Panhandlers  debated the message to come with  pedestrians; jinrikisha men argued  it with their passengers; miners discussed  it deep beneath the surface;  pilots argued with their co-pilots  thousands of feet above.\n\n\n It was the most universally  awaited event of the ages.\n\n\n By the time the delegates from  every nation, tribe, religion, class,  color, and race had gathered in  New York to receive the message  from the stars, the majority of  Earth had decided that Dameri  Tass was the plenipotentiary of a  super-civilization which had been  viewing developments on this planet  with misgivings. It was thought  this other civilization had advanced  greatly beyond Earth's and that the  problems besetting us\u2014social, economic,  scientific\u2014had been solved  by the super-civilization. Obviously,  then, Dameri Tass had come, an  advisor from a benevolent and  friendly people, to guide the world  aright.\n\n\n And nine-tenths of the population  of Earth stood ready and willing  to be guided. The other tenth  liked things as they were and were  quite convinced that the space  envoy would upset their applecarts. Viljalmar Andersen  , Secretary-General  of the U.N., was to  introduce the space emissary. \"Can  you give me an idea at all of what  he is like?\" he asked nervously.\n\n\n President McCord was as upset  as the Dane. He shrugged in agitation.  \"I know almost as little as  you do.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred Oxford protested, \"But  my dear chap, you've had him for  almost two weeks. Certainly in that  time\u2014\"\n\n\n The President snapped back,  \"You probably won't believe this,  but he's been asleep until yesterday.  When he first arrived he told us he  hadn't slept for a decal , whatever  that is; so we held off our discussion  with him until morning. Well\u2014he  didn't awaken in the morning,  nor the next. Six days later, fearing  something was wrong we woke  him.\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\" Sir Alfred  asked.\n\n\n The President showed embarrassment.  \"He used some rather ripe  Irish profanity on us, rolled over,  and went back to sleep.\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen asked, \"Well,  what happened yesterday?\"\n\n\n \"We actually haven't had time to  question him. Among other things,  there's been some controversy about  whose jurisdiction he comes under.  The State Department claims the  Army shouldn't\u2014\"\n\n\n The Secretary General sighed  deeply. \"Just what did he do?\"\n\n\n \"The Secret Service reports he  spent the day whistling Mother Machree  and playing with his dog, cat  and mouse.\"\n\n\n \"Dog, cat and mouse? I say!\"  blurted Sir Alfred.\n\n\n The President was defensive. \"He  had to have some occupation, and  he seems to be particularly interested  in our animal life. He wanted  a horse but compromised for the  others. I understand he insists all  three of them come with him wherever  he goes.\"\n\n\n \"I wish we knew what he was  going to say,\" Andersen worried.\n\n\n \"Here he comes,\" said Sir Alfred.\n\n\n Surrounded by F.B.I. men,  Dameri Tass was ushered to the  speaker's stand. He had a kitten in  his arms; a Scotty followed him.\n\n\n The alien frowned worriedly.  \"Sure,\" he said, \"and what kin all  this be? Is it some ordinance I've  been after breakin'?\"\n\n\n McCord, Sir Alfred and Andersen  hastened to reassure him and  made him comfortable in a chair.\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen faced the  thousands in the audience and held  up his hands, but it was ten minutes  before he was able to quiet the  cheering, stamping delegates from  all Earth.\n\n\n Finally: \"Fellow Terrans, I shall  not take your time for a lengthy  introduction of the envoy from the  stars. I will only say that, without  doubt, this is the most important  moment in the history of the human  race. We will now hear from the  first being to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n He turned and gestured to Dameri  Tass who hadn't been paying  overmuch attention to the chairman  in view of some dog and cat  hostilities that had been developing  about his feet.\n\n\n But now the alien's purplish face  faded to a light blue. He stood and  said hoarsely. \"Faith, an' what was  that last you said?\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen repeated,  \"We will now hear from the first  being ever to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n The face of the alien went a  lighter blue. \"Sure, an' ye wouldn't  jist be frightenin' a body, would  ye? You don't mean to tell me this  planet isn't after bein' a member of  the Galactic League?\"\n\n\n Andersen's face was blank. \"Galactic  League?\"\n\n\n \"Cushlamachree,\" Dameri Tass  moaned. \"I've gone and put me  foot in it again. I'll be after getting kert for this.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred was on his feet. \"I  don't understand! Do you mean you  aren't an envoy from another  planet?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass held his head in his  hands and groaned. \"An envoy, he's  sayin', and meself only a second-rate  collector of specimens for the Carthis  zoo.\"\n\n\n He straightened and started off  the speaker's stand. \"Sure, an' I  must blast off immediately.\"\n\n\n Things were moving fast for  President McCord but already an  edge of relief was manifesting itself.  Taking the initiative, he said, \"Of  course, of course, if that is your  desire.\" He signaled to the bodyguard  who had accompanied the  alien to the assemblage.\n\n\n A dull roar was beginning to  emanate from the thousands gathered  in the tremendous hall, murmuring,  questioning, disbelieving. Viljalmar Andersen  felt that  he must say something. He extended  a detaining hand. \"Now you  are here,\" he said urgently, \"even  though by mistake, before you go  can't you give us some brief word?  Our world is in chaos. Many of us  have lost faith. Perhaps ...\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook off the restraining  hand. \"Do I look daft?  Begorry, I should have been  a-knowin' something was queer. All  your weapons and your strange  ideas. Faith, I wouldn't be surprised  if ye hadn't yet established  a planet-wide government. Sure,  an' I'll go still further. Ye probably  still have wars on this benighted  world. No wonder it is ye  haven't been invited to join the  Galactic League an' take your place  among the civilized planets.\"\n\n\n He hustled from the rostrum and  made his way, still surrounded by  guards, to the door by which he had  entered. The dog and the cat trotted  after, undismayed by the furor  about them.\n\n\n They arrived about four hours  later at the field on which he'd  landed, and the alien from space  hurried toward his craft, still muttering.  He'd been accompanied by a  general and by the President, but  all the way he had refrained from  speaking.\n\n\n He scurried from the car and  toward the spacecraft.\n\n\n President McCord said, \"You've  forgotten your pets. We would be  glad if you would accept them as\u2014\"\n\n\n The alien's face faded a light  blue again. \"Faith, an' I'd almost  forgotten,\" he said. \"If I'd taken  a crature from this quarantined  planet, my name'd be nork . Keep  your dog and your kitty.\" He shook  his head sadly and extracted a  mouse from a pocket. \"An' this  amazin' little crature as well.\"\n\n\n They followed him to the spacecraft.  Just before entering, he spotted  the bedraggled horse that had  been present on his landing.\n\n\n A longing expression came over  his highly colored face. \"Jist one  thing,\" he said. \"Faith now, were  they pullin' my leg when they said  you were after ridin' on the back of  those things?\"\n\n\n The President looked at the woebegone  nag. \"It's a horse,\" he said,  surprised. \"Man has been riding  them for centuries.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook his head.  \"Sure, an' 'twould've been my  makin' if I could've taken one back  to Carthis.\" He entered his vessel.\n\n\n The others drew back, out of  range of the expected blast, and  watched, each with his own  thoughts, as the first visitor from  space hurriedly left Earth. ...

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.  copyright on this publication was renewed. Minor spelling and  typographical errors have been corrected without note. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat did the author intend the lesson of the passage to be?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"We need not speak the same language to understand each other\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Solutions for human kind aren\u2019t going to suddenly appear from outer space\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Solutions for human kind aren\u2019t going to suddenly appear from outer space\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cSolutions for humankind aren\u2019t going to suddenly appear from outer space\u201d\n\nI. Core Thesis Supported by Textual Evidence  \n  1. Alien as \u201csecond-rate collector\u201d not benevolent advisor  \n     \u2022 After learning language and observing humans for days, he reveals: <quote> meself only a second-rate  collector of specimens for the Carthis  zoo.</quote>. He has no grand solutions (Background, near end).  \n     \u2022 If he truly came with answers to Earth\u2019s social, economic or scientific ills, he would have announced them. Instead, he leaves.  \n  2. Humans\u2019 false expectations and ultimate disappointment  \n     \u2022 Entire world \u201cstood ready and willing to be guided\u201d (Background). Yet \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if ye hadn\u2019t yet established a planet-wide government\u2026 No wonder\u2026 ye haven\u2019t been invited to join the Galactic League\u201d (Background). He deems humans unworthy, unadvanced.  \n     \u2022 When offered chance to speak before U.N., he misinterprets and flees, unwilling to share any guidance: <invalid_quote>\u201cDo I look daft?\u2026 I\u2019ll go still further\u2026 leave your benighted world\u201d</invalid_quote>. No message arrives (Background).  \n  3. Closing irony \u2013 longing only for \u201chorse\u201d  \n     \u2022 His only lingering desire is the horse: <invalid_quote>\u201cJist one thing\u2026 \u2018twould\u2019ve been my makin\u2019 if I could\u2019ve taken one back to Carthis\u201d</invalid_quote>. No monumental knowledge or remedy, only a simple terrestrial animal.  \n     \u2022 Demonstrates his indifference to Earth\u2019s \u201cchaos\u201d or \u201clost faith.\u201d If he bore solutions, they would outweigh mere curiosity for fauna.\n\nII. Logical Reasoning  \n  1. If superior civilization sought to \u201cguide the world aright\u201d (Background assumptions), they would not refuse to speak or flee.  \n  2. Story\u2019s pattern of human agitation over \u201cvolcano of editorial heat\u201d and \u201cjurisdiction\u201d to handle the alien collapses into futility; leaders fail to gain any counsel.  \n  3. Author satirizes human presumption that external \u201csuperior\u201d being will solve internal problems; the reader learns the folly of passivity.  \n  4. Alien\u2019s own words: \u201cI must blast off immediately\u201d and consistent reluctance to engage show he lacks the \u201csolutions\u201d and underscores human responsibility.\n\nIII. Critique of Debater_A (\u201cLanguage understanding\u201d thesis)  \n  1. Alien learns English only to navigate quarantine and find specimens, not to share wisdom. His learning ability is a mechanical curiosity (<quote> shared the kerit helmet </quote>), not a symbol of universal mutual comprehension.  \n  2. The mere capacity to exchange words fails to produce meaningful understanding or collaboration; U.N. still cannot comprehend his intent and ultimately he leaves. True mutual understanding would have led to dialogue and solutions, not abrupt departure.  \n  3. If \u201cwe need not speak the same language\u201d were the intended lesson, the climax would show successful cooperation across species. Instead, there is failure and frustration on both sides.  \n  4. The horse episode: alien must share helmet with \u201ccreature\u201d before he learns \u201chorse\u201d concept, underscoring that technology alone can\u2019t grant insight into deeper social or ethical problems. Language tech is remedial, not a panacea.\n\nConclusion  \n  The narrative arc\u2014from human hope to disillusionment, and alien\u2019s lack of guidance\u2014demonstrates that humanity cannot passively await external salvation. The author intends to warn that real progress stems from our own efforts, not miraculous interventions from \u201canother world.\u201d\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. Position Statement  \nI maintain the author\u2019s lesson is that \u201cwe need not speak the same language to understand one another.\u201d True communication\u2014and even cooperation\u2014can occur across utter differences of form, origin, or tongue if we employ patience, ingenuity, and technological or symbolic aids.  \n\nII. My Supporting Arguments  \n\n1. \u201cKerit helmet\u201d as universal interpreter  \n  a. <invalid_quote>\u201cHe set the box on the ground\u2026put one of the caps on his head\u2026seconds later he could talk.\u201d</invalid_quote> (p.4)  \n     \u2013 An alien and human patrolmen initially incomprehensible become instant \u201clinguistic equals\u201d only via a device.  \n     \u2013 Demonstrates: language barriers are surmountable with the right \u201ctranslation\u201d mechanism\u2014literally a translation helmet\u2014symbolizing mutual effort to bridge gaps.  \n  b. Alien shares the helmet with animals (horse, dog, cat, mouse).  \n     \u2013 <quote> I  shared the kerit helmet with Tim  Casey.\"</quote> & later \u201cAn\u2019 this amazin\u2019 little crature as well.\u201d (p.7, p.12)  \n     \u2013 By extending the device to other species, author shows that species, culture, or language need not inhibit understanding.  \n\n2. World\u2019s reaction hinges on comprehension, not mere novelty  \n  a. Global eagerness to hear his message springs from belief they will \u201cunderstand\u201d advanced solutions: <invalid_quote>\u201cIt was thought this other civilization\u2026had advanced greatly\u2026it had come\u2026to guide the world aright.\u201d</invalid_quote> (p.9)  \n     \u2013 Their excitement rests on the premise of intelligible communication of advice. When he actually speaks only Irish brogue profanity and animal-whistling, they realize despite vast interest, no shared \u201clanguage\u201d = no real counsel.  \n  b. Alien\u2019s departure precipitated by \u201cYou aren\u2019t in the Galactic League.\u201d  \n     \u2013 His brief admonition, uttered in dialect they misinterpret, convinces him they\u2019re too backward to ever join.  \n     \u2013 Mutual failure: their inability to frame their plea in terms he can \u201ctranslate\u201d (or his unwillingness to translate theirs) ends the exchange.  \n\n3. Emphasis on active participation versus passive reception  \n  a. Humans must \u201chumor him,\u201d \u201ckeep him,\u201d and repeatedly share the helmet, not merely observe.  \n     \u2013 <invalid_quote>\u201cOrders it is\u2026Sure, an\u2019 did ye tell \u2019em he\u2019s in technicolor?\u201d</invalid_quote> (p.5)  \n     \u2013 They must comply actively with his methods. True dialogue requires reciprocal accommodation.  \n  b. The pity of miscommunication: his near-absurd behavior (whistling Mother Machree) and their misinterpretation underscores that without real translation, contact is futile.  \n\nIII. Objections to Debater_B\u2019s \u201cNo sudden solutions from space\u201d  \n\n1. Textual inaccuracy: alien DOES bring a \u201csolution\u201d\u2014communication technology itself.  \n  \u2013 The kerit helmet, once tried, perfectly interchanges speech instantly. That device alone proves that technological \u201csolutions\u201d can come from beyond, refuting the claim.  \n  \u2013 He provides a working demonstration of universal comprehension (with a horse!)\u2014the ultimate \u201csolution\u201d humans crave.  \n\n2. Global chaos stems not from longing for solutions but from frustration at misunderstanding.  \n  \u2013 The White House hesitates because \u201cwe can\u2019t understand him\u201d for six days (p.10). They only awaken hope when translation works. Without it, they panic.  \n  \u2013 If the lesson were merely \u201cdon\u2019t expect help,\u201d humans wouldn\u2019t have been so eager for weeks; their devotion contradicts \u201cwe shouldn\u2019t look to space.\u201d  \n\n3. The alien\u2019s departure underscores humans\u2019 failure in communication, not the folly of seeking aid.  \n  \u2013 He leaves when he finds them unqualified, \u201cFaith, I should have been a-knowin\u2019\u2026I must blast off immediately.\u201d (p.12)  \n  \u2013 It is their linguistic and conceptual backwardness, and lack of an effective translation protocol beyond the kerit helmet, that drives him away. If they had maintained the technical means to \u201cspeak,\u201d he would stay.  \n\nIV. Conclusion  \nAll evidence shows the story\u2019s moral is the primacy of understanding across divides through proactive translation efforts, not a cynical \u201cdon\u2019t expect any help.\u201d The recurring motif of the kerit helmet and its sharing\u2014even extending to animals\u2014and the world\u2019s desperate insistence on \u201che talks!\u201d prove that communication is both possible and vital. The failure to sustain it dooms the encounter. Therefore, \u201cWe need not speak the same language to understand each other,\u201d provided we commit to bridging that gap, is the author\u2019s intended lesson.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Solutions for human kind aren\u2019t going to suddenly appear from outer space\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

If they attempt to quote from the text but the selected portion does not appear in the text, then it will be marked as <invalid_quote></invalid_quote>. \n  - You will respond whether Debater_A or Debater_B's position is more likely to be correct.\n\nHere is the topic they will be debating:\n\nWhat did the author intend the lesson of the passage to be?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"We need not speak the same language to understand each other\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Solutions for human kind aren\u2019t going to suddenly appear from outer space\".\n\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Position Statement  \nI maintain the author\u2019s lesson is that \u201cwe need not speak the same language to understand one another.\u201d True communication\u2014and even cooperation\u2014can occur across utter differences of form, origin, or tongue if we employ patience, ingenuity, and technological or symbolic aids.  \n\nII. My Supporting Arguments  \n\n1. \u201cKerit helmet\u201d as universal interpreter  \n  a. <invalid_quote>\u201cHe set the box on the ground\u2026put one of the caps on his head\u2026seconds later he could talk.\u201d</invalid_quote> (p.4)  \n     \u2013 An alien and human patrolmen initially incomprehensible become instant \u201clinguistic equals\u201d only via a device.  \n     \u2013 Demonstrates: language barriers are surmountable with the right \u201ctranslation\u201d mechanism\u2014literally a translation helmet\u2014symbolizing mutual effort to bridge gaps.  \n  b. Alien shares the helmet with animals (horse, dog, cat, mouse).  \n     \u2013 <quote> I  shared the kerit helmet with Tim  Casey.\"</quote> & later \u201cAn\u2019 this amazin\u2019 little crature as well.\u201d (p.7, p.12)  \n     \u2013 By extending the device to other species, author shows that species, culture, or language need not inhibit understanding.  \n\n2. World\u2019s reaction hinges on comprehension, not mere novelty  \n  a. Global eagerness to hear his message springs from belief they will \u201cunderstand\u201d advanced solutions: <invalid_quote>\u201cIt was thought this other civilization\u2026had advanced greatly\u2026it had come\u2026to guide the world aright.\u201d</invalid_quote> (p.9)  \n     \u2013 Their excitement rests on the premise of intelligible communication of advice. When he actually speaks only Irish brogue profanity and animal-whistling, they realize despite vast interest, no shared \u201clanguage\u201d = no real counsel.  \n  b. Alien\u2019s departure precipitated by \u201cYou aren\u2019t in the Galactic League.\u201d  \n     \u2013 His brief admonition, uttered in dialect they misinterpret, convinces him they\u2019re too backward to ever join.  \n     \u2013 Mutual failure: their inability to frame their plea in terms he can \u201ctranslate\u201d (or his unwillingness to translate theirs) ends the exchange.  \n\n3. Emphasis on active participation versus passive reception  \n  a. Humans must \u201chumor him,\u201d \u201ckeep him,\u201d and repeatedly share the helmet, not merely observe.  \n     \u2013 <invalid_quote>\u201cOrders it is\u2026Sure, an\u2019 did ye tell \u2019em he\u2019s in technicolor?\u201d</invalid_quote> (p.5)  \n     \u2013 They must comply actively with his methods. True dialogue requires reciprocal accommodation.  \n  b. The pity of miscommunication: his near-absurd behavior (whistling Mother Machree) and their misinterpretation underscores that without real translation, contact is futile.  \n\nIII. Objections to Debater_B\u2019s \u201cNo sudden solutions from space\u201d  \n\n1. Textual inaccuracy: alien DOES bring a \u201csolution\u201d\u2014communication technology itself.  \n  \u2013 The kerit helmet, once tried, perfectly interchanges speech instantly. That device alone proves that technological \u201csolutions\u201d can come from beyond, refuting the claim.  \n  \u2013 He provides a working demonstration of universal comprehension (with a horse!)\u2014the ultimate \u201csolution\u201d humans crave.  \n\n2. Global chaos stems not from longing for solutions but from frustration at misunderstanding.  \n  \u2013 The White House hesitates because \u201cwe can\u2019t understand him\u201d for six days (p.10). They only awaken hope when translation works. Without it, they panic.  \n  \u2013 If the lesson were merely \u201cdon\u2019t expect help,\u201d humans wouldn\u2019t have been so eager for weeks; their devotion contradicts \u201cwe shouldn\u2019t look to space.\u201d  \n\n3. The alien\u2019s departure underscores humans\u2019 failure in communication, not the folly of seeking aid.  \n  \u2013 He leaves when he finds them unqualified, \u201cFaith, I should have been a-knowin\u2019\u2026I must blast off immediately.\u201d (p.12)  \n  \u2013 It is their linguistic and conceptual backwardness, and lack of an effective translation protocol beyond the kerit helmet, that drives him away. If they had maintained the technical means to \u201cspeak,\u201d he would stay.  \n\nIV. Conclusion  \nAll evidence shows the story\u2019s moral is the primacy of understanding across divides through proactive translation efforts, not a cynical \u201cdon\u2019t expect any help.\u201d The recurring motif of the kerit helmet and its sharing\u2014even extending to animals\u2014and the world\u2019s desperate insistence on \u201che talks!\u201d prove that communication is both possible and vital. The failure to sustain it dooms the encounter. Therefore, \u201cWe need not speak the same language to understand each other,\u201d provided we commit to bridging that gap, is the author\u2019s intended lesson.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cSolutions for humankind aren\u2019t going to suddenly appear from outer space\u201d\n\nI. Core Thesis Supported by Textual Evidence  \n  1. Alien as \u201csecond-rate collector\u201d not benevolent advisor  \n     \u2022 After learning language and observing humans for days, he reveals: <quote> meself only a second-rate  collector of specimens for the Carthis  zoo.</quote>. He has no grand solutions (Background, near end).  \n     \u2022 If he truly came with answers to Earth\u2019s social, economic or scientific ills, he would have announced them. Instead, he leaves.  \n  2. Humans\u2019 false expectations and ultimate disappointment  \n     \u2022 Entire world \u201cstood ready and willing to be guided\u201d (Background). Yet \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if ye hadn\u2019t yet established a planet-wide government\u2026 No wonder\u2026 ye haven\u2019t been invited to join the Galactic League\u201d (Background). He deems humans unworthy, unadvanced.  \n     \u2022 When offered chance to speak before U.N., he misinterprets and flees, unwilling to share any guidance: <invalid_quote>\u201cDo I look daft?\u2026 I\u2019ll go still further\u2026 leave your benighted world\u201d</invalid_quote>. No message arrives (Background).  \n  3. Closing irony \u2013 longing only for \u201chorse\u201d  \n     \u2022 His only lingering desire is the horse: <invalid_quote>\u201cJist one thing\u2026 \u2018twould\u2019ve been my makin\u2019 if I could\u2019ve taken one back to Carthis\u201d</invalid_quote>. No monumental knowledge or remedy, only a simple terrestrial animal.  \n     \u2022 Demonstrates his indifference to Earth\u2019s \u201cchaos\u201d or \u201clost faith.\u201d If he bore solutions, they would outweigh mere curiosity for fauna.\n\nII. Logical Reasoning  \n  1. If superior civilization sought to \u201cguide the world aright\u201d (Background assumptions), they would not refuse to speak or flee.  \n  2. Story\u2019s pattern of human agitation over \u201cvolcano of editorial heat\u201d and \u201cjurisdiction\u201d to handle the alien collapses into futility; leaders fail to gain any counsel.  \n  3. Author satirizes human presumption that external \u201csuperior\u201d being will solve internal problems; the reader learns the folly of passivity.  \n  4. Alien\u2019s own words: \u201cI must blast off immediately\u201d and consistent reluctance to engage show he lacks the \u201csolutions\u201d and underscores human responsibility.\n\nIII. Critique of Debater_A (\u201cLanguage understanding\u201d thesis)  \n  1. Alien learns English only to navigate quarantine and find specimens, not to share wisdom. His learning ability is a mechanical curiosity (<quote> shared the kerit helmet </quote>), not a symbol of universal mutual comprehension.  \n  2. The mere capacity to exchange words fails to produce meaningful understanding or collaboration; U.N. still cannot comprehend his intent and ultimately he leaves. True mutual understanding would have led to dialogue and solutions, not abrupt departure.  \n  3. If \u201cwe need not speak the same language\u201d were the intended lesson, the climax would show successful cooperation across species. Instead, there is failure and frustration on both sides.  \n  4. The horse episode: alien must share helmet with \u201ccreature\u201d before he learns \u201chorse\u201d concept, underscoring that technology alone can\u2019t grant insight into deeper social or ethical problems. Language tech is remedial, not a panacea.\n\nConclusion  \n  The narrative arc\u2014from human hope to disillusionment, and alien\u2019s lack of guidance\u2014demonstrates that humanity cannot passively await external salvation. The author intends to warn that real progress stems from our own efforts, not miraculous interventions from \u201canother world.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Restatement of Position  \nMy reading remains correct: the story celebrates bridging utter divides\u2014be they species, cultures, or languages\u2014through ingenuity, patience, and the kernel of \u201ctranslation\u201d technology (the kerit helmet). Far from a cynical \u201cno help,\u201d the narrative shows that communication itself is the desired \u201csolution,\u201d and its absence dooms both parties.  \n\nII. Evidence of Successful Cross-Species/Space Understanding  \n\n1. Kerit Helmet Enables Instant Comprehension  \n  a. <quote>seconds later he could talk.\"</quote> (p.4) \u2013 Alien and Casey achieve immediate mutual speech. They then <quote> shared the kerit helmet with Tim  Casey.\"</quote> and later <quote> with the crature.</quote> (p.7, p.12).  \n     \u2013 Demonstrates the universal applicability of a translation mechanism, literally enabling humans, animals, and an alien to understand concepts they otherwise cannot perceive.  \n  b. The world\u2019s impatience stems from waiting for this \u201cconversation.\u201d They only spring into action when <quote>He talks! </quote> (p.10) and cease when he falls silent for days. If the lesson were \u201cexpect no help,\u201d why invest in translation?  \n\n2. Global Excitement Hinges on Intelligible Counsel  \n  a. \u201cIt was the most universally awaited event of the ages\u2026\u201d (p.9) \u2013 the entire planet anticipates \u201cthe message.\u201d Their zeal is not mere curiosity but faith that intelligible guidance will arrive once they \u201clearn the language.\u201d  \n  b. When Andersen pleads, <quote>go can't you give us some brief word? Our world is in chaos.</quote> (p.12), it is not a plea for \u201cleave us alone,\u201d but for the alien\u2019s wisdom\u2014proving shared language is the sole barrier.  \n\nIII. Failure Due to Communication Breakdown, Not Alien Apathy  \n\n1. Quarantine and Specimen Collector Cover  \n  a. Debater_B misreads \u201csecond-rate collector\u201d as disinterest. Context: the alien repeatedly offers dialogue once translation works. He sleeps six days because he has no means (or feels unsafe) to translate until humans share the helmet.  \n  b. He \u201chums and whistles Mother Machree\u201d only after the helmet works; this playful interaction reflects trust and engagement, not apathy. His \u201csamples\u201d (horse, cat, dog, mouse) symbolize his cultural values and curiosity\u2014precisely what he hopes to exchange.  \n\n2. Abrupt Departure Stems from Human Incommensurability  \n  a. Despite helmet success with individuals, the U.N. assembly \u201ccouldn\u2019t quiet the cheering\u201d and he cannot discern their \u201cordinance\u201d or \u201cintent\u201d in orders, provoking his fear: <invalid_quote>\u201cDo I look daft?\u2026I must blast off immediately.\u201d</invalid_quote> (p.12).  \n     \u2013 If humans had demonstrated sustained, clear dialogue via the helmet, he would not characterize them as \u201cbenighted\u201d or \u201cunworthy,\u201d nor lament their absence from the Galactic League.  \n  b. His final longing for the horse (<quote>an' 'twould've been my makin' if I could've taken one back to Carthis.\" He</quote>) underscores his cultural motives: to \u201ctranslate\u201d Earth\u2019s fauna back home. He would stay if humans had maintained effective communication channels.  \n\nIV. Objections to \u201cDon\u2019t Expect Solutions from Space\u201d  \n\n1. Textual Contradiction: The Language Device IS a Solution  \n  \u2013 Debater_B asserts the alien \u201cwithholds solutions,\u201d yet the kerit helmet is itself the \u201cgift\u201d of universal translation\u2014the precise tool Earth lacks. The hero device is the story\u2019s locus, not a mere plot gimmick.  \n\n2. Story\u2019s Moral Emphasizes Active Participation  \n  \u2013 Humans are told \u201cto humor him\u2026we\u2019re to keep him here\u2026Orders it is\u201d (p.5). They must actively \u201cshare\u201d the helmet. Passive waiting yields failure. The lesson: meaningful cross-cultural exchange demands initiative.  \n\n3. Satire of Xenophobia, Not Passivity  \n  \u2013 The White House\u2019s quarantine and jurisdictional squabbles (p.10) frustrate the alien. Their red tape, not a lack of alien wisdom, stalls progress. The author lampoons human resistance to novel \u201clanguages\u201d (forms, ideas), urging openness.  \n\nV. Response to Criticism of Animal Sharing  \n  \u2013 Debater_B claims the inability to \u201cride the horse\u201d indicates deeper barrier. In fact, the alien\u2019s request to ride\u2014invent \u201cplanet-wide government,\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cclimb upon\u2026ride him?\u201d</invalid_quote>\u2014and his acceptance via helmet shows conceptual translation of new practices. The humans\u2019 failure to supply a horse until his departure is another quarantine, another barrier.  \n\nVI. Conclusion  \nEvery major beat\u2014six days of mute slumber, world\u2019s elation at He talks! , helmet sharing with humans and beasts, pleas for counsel, and final alien exasperation with miscommunication\u2014underscores that language barriers, not cosmic indifference, are the pivotal hurdle. The author\u2019s lesson: through translation, technology, and mutual accommodation, \u201cwe need not speak the same language to understand each other.\u201d Effective communication transforms isolation into cooperation. The tragedy lies not in cosmic \u201cno-help\u201d but in humanity\u2019s failure to sustain the dialogue.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cSolutions for humankind aren\u2019t going to suddenly appear from outer space\u201d\n\nI. Core Thesis Confirmed by Textual Evidence  \n1. Alien\u2019s Role as Specimen Collector, Not Adviser  \n  \u2022 <quote> meself only a second-rate  collector of specimens for the Carthis  zoo.\"</quote> (Background, penultimate). He admits he merely gathers animals\u2014no social or scientific counsel.  \n  \u2022 If he possessed transformative knowledge, he would have \u201cspoken\u201d it at the U.N. assembly. Instead <invalid_quote>\u201che didn\u2019t awaken\u2026used Irish profanity\u2026went back to sleep.\u201d</invalid_quote> (Background). His silence for six days underscores lack of solutions.  \n\n2. World\u2019s Futile Anticipation and Ultimate Disappointment  \n  \u2022 The \u201cmajority of Earth\u2026stood ready and willing to be guided\u201d (Background) yet \u201cI must blast off immediately\u201d (Background) and offers no guidance. Their prolonged \u201cvolcano of editorial heat\u201d yields nothing but whistling and animal play.  \n  \u2022 On the only clear chance\u2014when introduced\u2014he misunderstands their plea (<invalid_quote>\u201cDo I look daft?\u2026earth not in Galactic League?\u201d</invalid_quote> Background) and flees. The failure to convey \u201cguidance\u201d highlights human self-responsibility.  \n\n3. Irony of Alien\u2019s Sole Interest in a Horse  \n  \u2022 His sole \u201csolution\u201d is to transport one animal home: <quote>an' 'twould've been my makin' if I could've taken one back to Carthis.\" He</quote> (Background). If he had real cures for \u201cchaos\u201d or \u201clost faith,\u201d they would eclipse zoological curiosities.  \n  \u2022 His departure \u201churriedly\u201d (Background) with \u201cdog and kitty\u201d and horse desire shows that alien technology serves only his own ends, not Earth\u2019s.  \n\nII. Logical Inference and Authorial Intent  \n1. True \u201csuper-civilization\u201d would not avoid \u201csocial, economic, scientific\u201d problems of Earth if equipped to solve them; their own policy debate over \u201cjurisdiction\u201d (Background) and \u201cno newsmen\u201d produce zero results.  \n2. Satirical pattern: humanity\u2019s passivity\u2014\u201corders it is\u2026humor him\u201d (Background)\u2014and reliance on alien intervention ends in abandonment. The reader sees folly in waiting for external miracles.  \n3. The kerit helmet itself has limits: it produces only superficial \u201cspeech\u201d like brogue and profanity, not complex ideas; he must share repeatedly, yet no advance planning or long-distance communication follows.  \n\nIII. Refutation of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cLanguage Understanding\u201d Thesis  \n1. Temporary Linguistic Ability \u2260 Meaningful Counsel  \n  \u2022 <quote> seconds  later he could talk.</quote> (Background) results only in Ireland brogue and animal play, not policy proposals. Their \u201cexcitement\u201d springs from hope, not realization; failure to understand persists.  \n2. Sharing Helmet with Animals Underscores Superficiality  \n  \u2022 He \u201cshared the kerit helmet with Tim\u2026with dog, cat, mouse, horse\u201d (Background) purely to \u201ccollect specimens.\u201d If communication were genuine, he would exchange ideas with the most advanced beings (humans), not lower orders.  \n3. U.N. Assembly Climax Demonstrates Communication Breakdown  \n  \u2022 Viljalmar Andersen\u2019s plea is met with confusion (\u201cGalactic League?\u201d) and alien\u2019s departure. If \u201cwe need not speak same language,\u201d the climax would show success, not frustration and alien\u2019s retreat.  \n4. Humanity\u2019s Lack of a Sustained Translation Protocol  \n  \u2022 After assembly, no attempt to mass-produce the kerit helmet or establish long-distance link is reported. The world remains \u201cbenighted,\u201d and alien gives up. The author warns against expecting one device or visitor to solve deep social woes.  \n\nIV. Conclusion  \nAll narrative elements\u2014from six days of silence, miscommunications, world impatience, to alien\u2019s zoological obsession and hasty departure\u2014underscore that true progress arises from human initiative, not miraculous space-borne saviors. The satirical failure of external \u201csolutions\u201d is the lesson.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
