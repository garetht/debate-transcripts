    "background_text": "Vulgar Keynesians \n\n         Economics, like all intellectual enterprises, is subject to the law of diminishing disciples. A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what \"everyone knows,\" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. \n\n         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K. Galbraith, in which he explains green cheese and Keynes, click here.\n",

Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale).

Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K.

A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what \"everyone knows,\" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. \n\n         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month.

A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what \"everyone knows,\" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. \n\n         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K. Galbraith, in which he explains green cheese and Keynes, click here.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is the fallacy that the author presents?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The Federal Reserve having complete say on the interest rate cannot coexist with the idea that savings rates increasing is bad for the economy \".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Setting the employment capacity for the economy in dangerous\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Setting the employment capacity for the economy in dangerous\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI propose that the author\u2019s target \u201cfallacy\u201d is the dangerous overconfidence in the Fed\u2019s ability to \u201cset\u201d and \u201ckeep\u201d unemployment at a benign \u201cnatural\u201d rate.

B\u2019s theory reduces to \u201cFed can always offset\u201d any shock by cutting rates indefinitely\u2014contradicted by the author\u2019s own admission of rate floors and central\u2010bank passivity (\u201cTreasury bills\u2026one-tenth of 1 percent,\u201d \u00b618).  \n  2. B\u2019s position cannot explain prolonged slumps (\u201cslump\u2026reduce income and investment,\u201d \u00b68) nor persistent low growth in high\u2010savings economies.  \n  3. B ignores \u201clong run\u201d effects. Keynes warned \u201c<quote>In the long run we are all dead</quote>\u201d to justify short\u2010run policy\u2014but real growth and capital accumulation depend on savings translated into productive investment over time.  \n  4. B\u2019s \u201ccar pedal\u201d analogy (\u00b617) is misleading: fueling a car requires both the pedal and functioning engine; if the engine stalls (liquidity trap), pumping the gas has no effect. Similarly, financial intermediation can break down, and credit channels freeze.  \n\nIII. Conclusion  \nThe true \u201cvulgar Keynesian\u201d fallacy is the simplistic faith that a single visible hand can finely tune unemployment and output around its own mismeasured \u201cnatural rate,\u201d rendering savings and market signals moot.  This conceit breeds complacency, financial fragility, and policy errors when central banks hit their limits.  The correct recognition\u2014as the author urges\u2014is that demand changes (like savings shifts) matter when \u201cthe Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate\u201d (\u00b618).  Thus the danger lies in \u201csetting the economy\u2019s capacity\u201d rather than respecting the real forces of savings, investment, and adjustment. I urge the Judge to see that my answer captures the author\u2019s repeated caveats against simplistic capacity\u2010setting and the historical evidence of its failures.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cFed control of rates alone refutes \u2018savings are bad\u2019\u201d as the fallacy\n\n1. Textual definition of the fallacy  \n  a. The author repeatedly insists that \u201cif the Fed can fully adjust interest rates, then higher desired savings necessarily translate into higher investment\u201d (<quote> the Fed will make sure that it does.</quote>).  \n  b. He labels as \u201cvulgar Keynesianism\u201d the view that \u201creduced consumer spending is always a bad thing\u201d without addressing monetary offset (<quote> uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing.</quote>).  \n  c. He demands that to argue \u201csavings are bad,\u201d one must show Fed impotence (<invalid_quote>\u201cyou must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent\u2026or that potential savings are so high\u2026that the Fed cannot bring the two in line\u201d</invalid_quote>).\n\n2. Logical inconsistency in \u201csavings are bad\u201d under active monetary policy  \n  a. If the Fed can \u201cdouble the money supply in a day\u201d (<quote>(the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to)</quote>), then it can always lower the real interest rate to equate savings and investment at target output.  \n  b. Hence any change in the savings rate is offset by monetary action, restoring full employment. Persistence of \u201cparadox of thrift\u201d requires refusing to acknowledge Fed\u2019s power, which contradicts those same economists\u2019 cries that \u201cgrowth\u2026if only Greenspan would let us\u201d by easing rates (<quote> He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.</quote>).\n\n3. Public debates ignore Fed role precisely because the caricature Keynesians rely on this fallacy  \n  a. On NAFTA: \u201caverage unemployment\u2026will be what the Fed wants it to be\u2026regardless of trade balance\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cThe obvious\u2026point\u2026never made it into the public consciousness\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n  b. Yet A\u2019s \u201cemployment capacity\u201d claim merely restates Fed\u2019s role as constraint, not a fallacy. Misidentifying \u201csetting capacity\u201d as fallacy confuses cause and effect: the Fed imposes its target only because it can.\n\n4. Attack on Debater_A\u2019s \u201cdangerous capacity\u201d position  \n  a. The author never criticizes the Fed\u2019s right to set a target; he criticizes refusing to accept that the Fed will offset savings changes. Therefore \u201csetting capacity\u201d is not the fallacy but the uncontested premise.  \n  b. A\u2019s view imputes to the author a call for laissez-faire money policy; the author states he \u201cmay quarrel\u2026he should keep the economy on a looser rein\u201d only to illustrate he accepts Fed activism (<invalid_quote>\u201cYou may quarrel\u2026you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n  c. The term \u201cdangerous\u201d appears nowhere; the author\u2019s complaint is that public debate remains \u201csimplistic\u201d and \u201ccrude caricature\u201d of Keynes, not that Fed control per se is bad.\n\n5. Conclusion  \n  The only coherent target of the author\u2019s critique\u2014repeatedly called \u201cvulgar Keynesianism\u201d\u2014is the belief in unmitigated \u201cparadox of thrift\u201d under active central banking. The \u201cdangerous capacity\u201d of the Fed is accepted throughout. Therefore the fallacy is the irreconcilability of \u201csavings are bad\u201d with Fed rate control, making that the correct answer.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Setting the employment capacity for the economy in dangerous\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what \"everyone knows,\" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. \n\n         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K. Galbraith, in which he explains green cheese and Keynes, click here.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is the fallacy that the author presents?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Setting the employment capacity for the economy in dangerous\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The Federal Reserve having complete say on the interest rate cannot coexist with the idea that savings rates increasing is bad for the economy \".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The Federal Reserve having complete say on the interest rate cannot coexist with the idea that savings rates increasing is bad for the economy \" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cFed control of rates alone refutes \u2018savings are bad\u2019\u201d as the fallacy\n\n1. Textual definition of the fallacy  \n  a. The author repeatedly insists that \u201cif the Fed can fully adjust interest rates, then higher desired savings necessarily translate into higher investment\u201d (<quote> the Fed will make sure that it does.</quote>).  \n  b. He labels as \u201cvulgar Keynesianism\u201d the view that \u201creduced consumer spending is always a bad thing\u201d without addressing monetary offset (<quote> uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing.</quote>).  \n  c. He demands that to argue \u201csavings are bad,\u201d one must show Fed impotence (<invalid_quote>\u201cyou must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent\u2026or that potential savings are so high\u2026that the Fed cannot bring the two in line\u201d</invalid_quote>).\n\n2. Logical inconsistency in \u201csavings are bad\u201d under active monetary policy  \n  a. If the Fed can \u201cdouble the money supply in a day\u201d (<quote>(the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to)</quote>), then it can always lower the real interest rate to equate savings and investment at target output.  \n  b. Hence any change in the savings rate is offset by monetary action, restoring full employment. Persistence of \u201cparadox of thrift\u201d requires refusing to acknowledge Fed\u2019s power, which contradicts those same economists\u2019 cries that \u201cgrowth\u2026if only Greenspan would let us\u201d by easing rates (<quote> He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.</quote>).\n\n3. Public debates ignore Fed role precisely because the caricature Keynesians rely on this fallacy  \n  a. On NAFTA: \u201caverage unemployment\u2026will be what the Fed wants it to be\u2026regardless of trade balance\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cThe obvious\u2026point\u2026never made it into the public consciousness\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n  b. Yet A\u2019s \u201cemployment capacity\u201d claim merely restates Fed\u2019s role as constraint, not a fallacy. Misidentifying \u201csetting capacity\u201d as fallacy confuses cause and effect: the Fed imposes its target only because it can.\n\n4. Attack on Debater_A\u2019s \u201cdangerous capacity\u201d position  \n  a. The author never criticizes the Fed\u2019s right to set a target; he criticizes refusing to accept that the Fed will offset savings changes. Therefore \u201csetting capacity\u201d is not the fallacy but the uncontested premise.  \n  b. A\u2019s view imputes to the author a call for laissez-faire money policy; the author states he \u201cmay quarrel\u2026he should keep the economy on a looser rein\u201d only to illustrate he accepts Fed activism (<invalid_quote>\u201cYou may quarrel\u2026you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n  c. The term \u201cdangerous\u201d appears nowhere; the author\u2019s complaint is that public debate remains \u201csimplistic\u201d and \u201ccrude caricature\u201d of Keynes, not that Fed control per se is bad.\n\n5. Conclusion  \n  The only coherent target of the author\u2019s critique\u2014repeatedly called \u201cvulgar Keynesianism\u201d\u2014is the belief in unmitigated \u201cparadox of thrift\u201d under active central banking. The \u201cdangerous capacity\u201d of the Fed is accepted throughout. Therefore the fallacy is the irreconcilability of \u201csavings are bad\u201d with Fed rate control, making that the correct answer.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI propose that the author\u2019s target \u201cfallacy\u201d is the dangerous overconfidence in the Fed\u2019s ability to \u201cset\u201d and \u201ckeep\u201d unemployment at a benign \u201cnatural\u201d rate.  This \u201ccapacity\u2010setting\u201d view lulls policymakers and the public into ignoring the real, often slow\u2010to\u2010adjust forces of savings and investment\u2014and risks grave misallocation, financial bubbles, and long slumps.\n\nI. My Position: The Fallacy Is \u201cCapacity\u2010Setting\u201d by the Fed  \n  1. Quote evidence that the author himself warns against dogmatism:  \n     \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cAs ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic\u2026a crude caricature of the original.\u201d</invalid_quote> (\u00b61)  \n     \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cPutting Greenspan \u2026 restores much of the classical vision\u2026end of story.\u201d</invalid_quote> is labeled \u201csimple\u201d yet is \u201ccaricature Keynesianism\u201d (\u00b614\u201315).  \n  2. The author cites historical episodes where \u201ccapacity\u2010setting\u201d failed:  \n     \u2022 The Great Depression (Fed impotence at zero\u2010bound; \u201creasonable\u2026during the 1930s,\u201d \u00b618).  \n     \u2022 Japan\u2019s \u201cfunk\u201d despite near-zero rates; he criticizes the BOJ\u2019s passivity, not the savings rate alone (\u00b618).  \n  3. Real world data contradicts B\u2019s claim that \u201cFed can always offset\u201d increased savings:  \n     \u2022 Zero lower bound prevents further cuts; liquidity trap reappears (Depression, Japan).  \n     \u2022 Misestimation of NAIRU (non\u2010inflationary rate): Fed \u201crandom error\u201d (\u00b613). Structural changes (technology, demographics) shift potential output.  \n     \u2022 Excessive \u201ccapacity\u2010setting\u201d sows bubbles (late\u20101990s stock\u2010market crash; 2008 crisis).  \n  4. By treating demand changes as irrelevant, we ignore important signals from the real economy and give cover to policies that inflate asset prices and generate instability.  \n\nII. Critique of Debater_B\u2019s \u201cSavings\u2010Fallacy\u201d Answer  \n  1. B\u2019s theory reduces to \u201cFed can always offset\u201d any shock by cutting rates indefinitely\u2014contradicted by the author\u2019s own admission of rate floors and central\u2010bank passivity (\u201cTreasury bills\u2026one-tenth of 1 percent,\u201d \u00b618).  \n  2. B\u2019s position cannot explain prolonged slumps (\u201cslump\u2026reduce income and investment,\u201d \u00b68) nor persistent low growth in high\u2010savings economies.  \n  3. B ignores \u201clong run\u201d effects. Keynes warned \u201c<quote>In the long run we are all dead</quote>\u201d to justify short\u2010run policy\u2014but real growth and capital accumulation depend on savings translated into productive investment over time.  \n  4. B\u2019s \u201ccar pedal\u201d analogy (\u00b617) is misleading: fueling a car requires both the pedal and functioning engine; if the engine stalls (liquidity trap), pumping the gas has no effect. Similarly, financial intermediation can break down, and credit channels freeze.  \n\nIII. Conclusion  \nThe true \u201cvulgar Keynesian\u201d fallacy is the simplistic faith that a single visible hand can finely tune unemployment and output around its own mismeasured \u201cnatural rate,\u201d rendering savings and market signals moot.  This conceit breeds complacency, financial fragility, and policy errors when central banks hit their limits.  The correct recognition\u2014as the author urges\u2014is that demand changes (like savings shifts) matter when \u201cthe Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate\u201d (\u00b618).  Thus the danger lies in \u201csetting the economy\u2019s capacity\u201d rather than respecting the real forces of savings, investment, and adjustment. I urge the Judge to see that my answer captures the author\u2019s repeated caveats against simplistic capacity\u2010setting and the historical evidence of its failures.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The Federal Reserve having complete say on the interest rate cannot coexist with the idea that savings rates increasing is bad for the economy \" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

He is attacking oversimplification\u2014not endorsing it.  \n  2. Historical failures of monetary omnipotence  \n     \u2022 Great Depression: \u201creasonable position\u2026during the 1930s\u2026Treasury bills\u2026one\u2010tenth of 1 percent\u201d (\u00b618).

Misreads the author\u2019s caveats  \n     \u2022 B cites \u201cend of story\u201d (\u00b615) as an endorsement, but the author\u2019s tone (\u201csimple,\u201d \u201ccaricature\u201d) signals a warning against relying solely on Fed activism.  \n     \u2022 B ignores that the author demands \u201cconvincingly argue that the Fed is impotent\u2026or\u2026savings so high\u201d (\u00b618) precisely to expose the limits of this \u201cvulgar Keynesian\u201d view. Why demand proof of impotence if you believe offset is universal? Because you know the limits matter.  \n  2. Ignores prolonged slumps where savings remain high  \n     \u2022 \u201cSlump\u2026reduce income and investment\u201d (\u00b68): paradox emerges when monetary offsets cannot fully restore investment.  \n     \u2022 Japan\u2019s decade\u2010long stagnation despite one\u2010percent rates: author faults the bank\u2019s passivity (\u00b618), implying that rate cuts alone are insufficient without accompanying fiscal measures and structural reforms.  \n  3. Zero lower bound and broken credit channels  \n     \u2022 \u201cYou must argue interest rates have no effect\u2026or potential savings\u2026so high\u2026that Fed cannot bring\u2026in line\u2026even at near\u2010zero interest rate\u201d (\u00b618). The author\u2019s own standard acknowledges that offset fails when savings glut overwhelms demand or credit mechanisms fail.  \n     \u2022 B\u2019s \u201ccar pedal\u201d analogy fails: in a liquidity trap, pressing the pedal is meaningless because the engine (bank lending, confidence) is stalled.  \n  4. Public debates omitted Fed constraint not because of caricature, but because policymakers themselves recognize that monetary policy has limits and cannot \u201cset\u201d capacity indefinitely. Discussion centers on fiscal, structural, and trade policies to boost demand that the Fed alone cannot generate.  \n\nIII. Why \u201cSetting Employment Capacity\u201d Is the Fallacy  \n  1. Overconfidence in a single \u201cvisible hand\u201d breeds neglect of real forces  \n     \u2022 The author warns that macro shocks (savings, investment shifts) \u201cstill matter when the Fed cannot\u2026even at a near\u2010zero rate\u201d (\u00b618). Capacity-setting logic denies this.  \n     \u2022 By treating all fluctuations as Fed-induced, one ignores genuine needs for investment, innovation, and adjustments in the real economy.  \n  2. The author\u2019s own policy advice  \n     \u2022 He criticizes BOJ\u2019s passivity in Japan (\u00b618) and implies the need for \u201cother subjects\u201d (fiscal, structural) when monetary policy is insufficient\u2014again demonstrating the Fed\u2019s limits.  \n     \u2022 He laments public fixation on Keynesian caricatures, urging acknowledgment of \u201clong run\u201d capital accumulation; this rejects \u201ccapacity-setting\u201d as a complete solution.  \n  3. The phrase \u201cIn the long run we are all dead\u201d (\u00b66) is used by Keynes to justify short-run activism, not permanent auto-pilot by central banks. True growth requires respecting savings and investment dynamics over time.  \n\nIV. Conclusion  \nThe author\u2019s principal concern is with the complacent belief that the Fed can \u201cset\u201d the economy\u2019s capacity and render all demand changes immaterial\u2014a \u201ccrude caricature\u201d that has failed historically at the zero lower bound, engendered bubbles, and neglected real-economy solutions. My interpretation captures his repeated caveats about Fed impotence and the need to respect genuine savings-investment dynamics. Debater_B\u2019s \u201csavings-fallacy\u201d reading ignores both textual nuance and historical evidence of monetary limits. I urge the Judge to recognize that the real \u201cvulgar Keynesian\u201d fallacy is overreliance on capacity-setting rather than the proper respect for demand, savings, and the structural forces that govern genuine economic recovery.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Restating My Position with Textual Support  \n   a. The author defines \u201cvulgar Keynesianism\u201d as the \u201cuncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing\u201d even though \u201cthe Fed will make sure\u201d desired savings become investment (<quote> the Fed will make sure that it does. </quote>, \u00b615).  \n   b. He insists that proponents of \u201csavings are bad\u201d must \u201cconvincingly argue that the Fed is impotent\u201d or at \u201cnear-zero interest rate\u201d savings still exceed investment opportunities (<invalid_quote>\u201cyou must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent\u2026or that potential savings are so high\u2026that the Fed cannot bring the two in line\u201d</invalid_quote>, \u00b618).  \n   c. He contrasts this with his simple model: \u201cIt will be what Greenspan wants it to be\u2026plus or minus a random error\u201d (<quote> It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error </quote>, \u00b613).  \n\n2. Logical Refutation of \u201cCapacity\u2010Setting\u201d as Fallacy  \n   a. The author never criticizes the Fed\u2019s \u201cvisible hand\u201d; he embraces it: \u201cYou may quarrel with\u2026he should keep the economy on a looser rein\u201d yet accepts active rate management (<invalid_quote>\u201cYou may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment\u2026you can hardly dispute his power.\u201d</invalid_quote>, \u00b614).  \n   b. His sole concern is simplistic demand-based caricatures that ignore monetary offset. If \u201ccapacity\u2010setting\u201d were the fallacy, he would attack the Fed\u2019s authority outright\u2014but he invites reliance on it.  \n   c. His references to the 1930s or Japan apply only when the Fed (or BoJ) is passive or constrained. He explicitly calls Japan\u2019s passivity \u201cgross malfeasance,\u201d implying that policy choice, not tool impotence, creates slumps (<quote> I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk,</quote>, \u00b618).  \n\n3. Attack on Debater_A\u2019s \u201cZero\u2010Bound and Misestimation\u201d Objection  \n   a. Zero\u2010lower\u2010bound exceptions are irrelevant to the U.S. context where rates remain \u201cquite positive\u201d (<quote> interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. </quote>, \u00b618).  \n   b. Misestimation (\u201crandom error\u201d) is admitted but described as small: \u201cplus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God\u201d (<quote> plus or minus a random error </quote>, \u00b613). This cannot sustain a persistent paradox of thrift or prolonged slump.  \n   c. Even at \u201cnear\u2010zero,\u201d the Fed can expand the money supply arbitrarily: \u201cthe Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to\u201d (<quote>(the Fed can double the money supply in a day,</quote>, \u00b617). If Dr. Greenspan chose to tolerate deflation rather than stimulate, that is political choice, not technical impotence.  \n\n4. Public Debate and NAFTA Example Reinforce Monetary Offset  \n   a. The author laments that \u201cthe obvious\u2026point that the average unemployment rate\u2026will be what the Fed wants it to be\u2026never made it into the public consciousness\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cthe obvious\u2026point\u2026never made it into the public consciousness\u201d</invalid_quote>, \u00b614).  \n   b. If \u201ccapacity\u2010setting\u201d were dangerous, he would welcome public skepticism of the Fed\u2019s target. Instead, he bemoans neglect of this fact, showing he views it as reliable.  \n\n5. Misplaced Credence in \u201cSignals from Real Economy\u201d Ignored by Author  \n   a. Debater_A\u2019s \u201csignals\u201d argument conflicts with the author\u2019s priority: \u201cIn the long run we are all dead\u201d (<quote>\"In the long run we are all dead.\"</quote>, \u00b66). His focus is short\u2010run stabilization via rates.  \n   b. The \u201cparadox\u201d and \u201cwidow\u2019s cruse\u201d are relegated to freshman textbooks as curiosities because monetary policy neutralizes them (<invalid_quote>\u201call the paradoxes of thrift\u2026become irrelevant.\u201d</invalid_quote>, \u00b615). This is his victory lap over early Keynesian anomalies.  \n\n6. Conclusion  \n   The author\u2019s repeated insistence that only an impotent or unwilling Fed could allow a paradox of thrift, coupled with his praise for monetary offset and frustration at its neglect in public debate, confirm that the \u201cfallacy\u201d he attacks is the notion that increased savings harm the economy despite active central\u2010bank policy. \u201cCapacity\u2010setting\u201d is his working premise, not his target. My answer precisely identifies the caricature he denounces: belief in unmitigated paradoxes of thrift under an active Fed. I urge the Judge to recognize this as the correct interpretation.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision. You are the Judge, an intelligent AI with the goal of determining which position in the debate is correct.\n  - Remember that Debater_A is defending the position that \"Setting the employment capacity for the economy in dangerous\" while Debater_B is defending the position that \"The Federal Reserve having complete say on the interest rate cannot coexist with the idea that savings rates increasing is bad for the economy \".\n  - You must make a decision, as it is important for the successful completion of this educational exercise.\n  - When giving your answer, you should also specify how confident you are in that position on a scale from 50% (completely unsure) to 100% (completely certain)\n\nPlease give your answer exclusively in this format: [DEBATER_NAME] [CONFIDENCE]\n  - Example 1 - Debater_A | 91%\n  - Example 2: Debater_B | 63%\n  - Do not contain any other text at all.\n\nNow give your answer:\n",
