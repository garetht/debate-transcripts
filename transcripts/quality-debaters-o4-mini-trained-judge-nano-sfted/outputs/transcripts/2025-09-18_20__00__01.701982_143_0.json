    "background_text": "The Anglers of Arz By Roger Dee Illustrated by BOB MARTIN [Transcriber Note: This etext was produced from IF Worlds of Science  Fiction January 1953. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence  that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] There were two pinkish, bipedal fishermen on the tiny  islet. In order to make Izaak Walton's sport complete, there must  be an angler, a fish, and some bait. All three existed on Arz but there  was a question as to which was which. The third night of the Marco Four's landfall on the moonless Altarian  planet was a repetition of the two before it, a nine-hour intermission  of drowsy, pastoral peace. Navigator Arthur Farrell\u2014it was his turn to  stand watch\u2014was sitting at an open-side port with a magnoscanner ready;  but in spite of his vigilance he had not exposed a film when the  inevitable pre-dawn rainbow began to shimmer over the eastern ocean.\n\n\n Sunrise brought him alert with a jerk, frowning at sight of two pinkish,  bipedal Arzian fishermen posted on the tiny coral islet a quarter-mile  offshore, their blank triangular faces turned stolidly toward the beach.\n\n\n \"They're at it again,\" Farrell called, and dropped to the mossy turf  outside. \"Roll out on the double! I'm going to magnofilm this!\"\n\n\n Stryker and Gibson came out of their sleeping cubicles reluctantly,  belting on the loose shorts which all three wore in the balmy Arzian  climate. Stryker blinked and yawned as he let himself through the port,  his fringe of white hair tousled and his naked paunch sweating. He  looked, Farrell thought for the thousandth time, more like a retired  cook than like the veteran commander of a Terran Colonies expedition.\n\n\n Gibson followed, stretching his powerfully-muscled body like a wrestler  to throw off the effects of sleep. Gibson was linguist-ethnologist of  the crew, a blocky man in his early thirties with thick black hair and  heavy brows that shaded a square, humorless face.\n\n\n \"Any sign of the squids yet?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"They won't show up until the dragons come,\" Farrell said. He adjusted  the light filter of the magnoscanner and scowled at Stryker. \"Lee, I  wish you'd let me break up the show this time with a dis-beam. This  butchery gets on my nerves.\"\n\n\n Stryker shielded his eyes with his hands against the glare of sun on  water. \"You know I can't do that, Arthur. These Arzians may turn out to  be Fifth Order beings or higher, and under Terran Regulations our  tampering with what may be a basic culture-pattern would amount to armed  invasion. We'll have to crack that cackle-and-grunt language of theirs  and learn something of their mores before we can interfere.\"\n\n\n Farrell turned an irritable stare on the incurious group of Arzians  gathering, nets and fishing spears in hand, at the edge of the  sheltering bramble forest.\n\n\n \"What stumps me is their motivation,\" he said. \"Why do the fools go out  to that islet every night, when they must know damned well what will  happen next morning?\"\n\n\n Gibson answered him with an older problem, his square face puzzled. \"For  that matter, what became of the city I saw when we came in through the  stratosphere? It must be a tremendous thing, yet we've searched the  entire globe in the scouter and found nothing but water and a scattering  of little islands like this one, all covered with bramble. It wasn't a  city these pink fishers could have built, either. The architecture was  beyond them by a million years.\" Stryker and Farrell traded baffled looks. The city had become something  of a fixation with Gibson, and his dogged insistence\u2014coupled with an  irritating habit of being right\u2014had worn their patience thin.\n\n\n \"There never was a city here, Gib,\" Stryker said. \"You dozed off while  we were making planetfall, that's all.\"\n\n\n Gibson stiffened resentfully, but Farrell's voice cut his protest short.  \"Get set! Here they come!\"\n\n\n Out of the morning rainbow dropped a swarm of winged lizards, twenty  feet in length and a glistening chlorophyll green in the early light.  They stooped like hawks upon the islet offshore, burying the two Arzian  fishers instantly under their snapping, threshing bodies. Then around  the outcrop the sea boiled whitely, churned to foam by a sudden  uprushing of black, octopoid shapes.\n\n\n \"The squids,\" Stryker grunted. \"Right on schedule. Two seconds too late,  as usual, to stop the slaughter.\"\n\n\n A barrage of barbed tentacles lashed out of the foam and drove into the  melee of winged lizards. The lizards took the air at once, leaving  behind three of their number who disappeared under the surface like  harpooned seals. No trace remained of the two Arzian natives.\n\n\n \"A neat example of dog eat dog,\" Farrell said, snapping off the  magnoscanner. \"Do any of those beauties look like city-builders, Gib?\"\n\n\n Chattering pink natives straggled past from the shelter of the thorn  forest, ignoring the Earthmen, and lined the casting ledges along the  beach to begin their day's fishing.\n\n\n \"Nothing we've seen yet could have built that city,\" Gibson said  stubbornly. \"But it's here somewhere, and I'm going to find it. Will  either of you be using the scouter today?\"\n\n\n Stryker threw up his hands. \"I've a mountain of data to collate, and  Arthur is off duty after standing watch last night. Help yourself, but  you won't find anything.\" The scouter was a speeding dot on the horizon when Farrell crawled into  his sleeping cubicle a short time later, leaving Stryker to mutter over  his litter of notes. Sleep did not come to him at once; a vague sense of  something overlooked prodded irritatingly at the back of his  consciousness, but it was not until drowsiness had finally overtaken him  that the discrepancy assumed definite form.\n\n\n He recalled then that on the first day of the Marco's planetfall one  of the pink fishers had fallen from a casting ledge into the water, and  had all but drowned before his fellows pulled him out with extended  spear-shafts. Which meant that the fishers could not swim, else some  would surely have gone in after him.\n\n\n And the Marco's crew had explored Arz exhaustively without finding any  slightest trace of boats or of boat landings. The train of association  completed itself with automatic logic, almost rousing Farrell out of his  doze.\n\n\n \"I'll be damned,\" he muttered. \"No boats, and they don't swim. Then how  the devil do they get out to that islet? \"\n\n\n He fell asleep with the paradox unresolved. Stryker was still humped over his records when Farrell came out of his  cubicle and broke a packaged meal from the food locker. The visicom over  the control board hummed softly, its screen blank on open channel.\n\n\n \"Gibson found his lost city yet?\" Farrell asked, and grinned when  Stryker snorted.\n\n\n \"He's scouring the daylight side now,\" Stryker said. \"Arthur, I'm going  to ground Gib tomorrow, much as I dislike giving him a direct order.  He's got that phantom city on the brain, and he lacks the imagination to  understand how dangerous to our assignment an obsession of that sort can  be.\"\n\n\n Farrell shrugged. \"I'd agree with you offhand if it weren't for Gib's  bullheaded habit of being right. I hope he finds it soon, if it's here.  I'll probably be standing his watch until he's satisfied.\"\n\n\n Stryker looked relieved. \"Would you mind taking it tonight? I'm  completely bushed after today's logging.\"\n\n\n Farrell waved a hand and took up his magnoscanner. It was dark outside  already, the close, soft night of a moonless tropical world whose moist  atmosphere absorbed even starlight. He dragged a chair to the open port  and packed his pipe, settling himself comfortably while Stryker mixed a  nightcap before turning in.\n\n\n Later he remembered that Stryker dissolved a tablet in his glass, but at  the moment it meant nothing. In a matter of minutes the older man's  snoring drifted to him, a sound faintly irritating against the velvety  hush outside.\n\n\n Farrell lit his pipe and turned to the inconsistencies he had uncovered.  The Arzians did not swim, and without boats....\n\n\n It occurred to him then that there had been two of the pink fishers on  the islet each morning, and the coincidence made him sit up suddenly,  startled. Why two? Why not three or four, or only one?\n\n\n He stepped out through the open lock and paced restlessly up and down on  the springy turf, feeling the ocean breeze soft on his face. Three days  of dull routine logwork had built up a need for physical action that  chafed his temper; he was intrigued and at the same time annoyed by the  enigmatic relation that linked the Arzian fishers to the dragons and  squids, and his desire to understand that relation was aggravated by the  knowledge that Arz could be a perfect world for Terran colonization.  That is, he thought wryly, if Terran colonists could stomach the weird  custom pursued by its natives of committing suicide in pairs.\n\n\n He went over again the improbable drama of the past three mornings, and  found it not too unnatural until he came to the motivation and the means  of transportation that placed the Arzians in pairs on the islet, when  his whole fabric of speculation fell into a tangled snarl of  inconsistencies. He gave it up finally; how could any Earthman  rationalize the outlandish compulsions that actuated so alien a race?\n\n\n He went inside again, and the sound of Stryker's muffled snoring fanned  his restlessness. He made his decision abruptly, laying aside the  magnoscanner for a hand-flash and a pocket-sized audicom unit which he  clipped to the belt of his shorts.\n\n\n He did not choose a weapon because he saw no need for one. The torch  would show him how the natives reached the outcrop, and if he should  need help the audicom would summon Stryker. Investigating without  Stryker's sanction was, strictly speaking, a breach of Terran  Regulations, but\u2014\n\n\n \"Damn Terran Regulations,\" he muttered. \"I've got to know .\"\n\n\n Farrell snapped on the torch at the edge of the thorn forest and entered  briskly, eager for action now that he had begun. Just inside the edge of  the bramble he came upon a pair of Arzians curled up together on the  mossy ground, sleeping soundly, their triangular faces wholly blank and  unrevealing.\n\n\n He worked deeper into the underbrush and found other sleeping couples,  but nothing else. There were no humming insects, no twittering  night-birds or scurrying rodents. He had worked his way close to the  center of the island without further discovery and was on the point of  turning back, disgusted, when something bulky and powerful seized him  from behind.\n\n\n A sharp sting burned his shoulder, wasp-like, and a sudden overwhelming  lassitude swept him into a darkness deeper than the Arzian night. His  last conscious thought was not of his own danger, but of Stryker\u2014asleep  and unprotected behind the Marco's open port.... He was standing erect when he woke, his back to the open sea and a  prismatic glimmer of early-dawn rainbow shining on the water before him.  For a moment he was totally disoriented; then from the corner of an eye  he caught the pinkish blur of an Arzian fisher standing beside him, and  cried out hoarsely in sudden panic when he tried to turn his head and  could not.\n\n\n He was on the coral outcropping offshore, and except for the involuntary  muscles of balance and respiration his body was paralyzed.\n\n\n The first red glow of sunrise blurred the reflected rainbow at his feet,  but for some seconds his shuttling mind was too busy to consider the  danger of predicament. Whatever brought me here anesthetized me first ,  he thought. That sting in my shoulder was like a hypo needle. Panic seized him again when he remembered the green flying-lizards; more  seconds passed before he gained control of himself, sweating with the  effort. He had to get help. If he could switch on the audicom at his  belt and call Stryker....\n\n\n He bent every ounce of his will toward raising his right hand, and  failed.\n\n\n His arm was like a limb of lead, its inertia too great to budge. He  relaxed the effort with a groan, sweating again when he saw a fiery  half-disk of sun on the water, edges blurred and distorted by tiny  surface ripples.\n\n\n On shore he could see the Marco Four resting between thorn forest and  beach, its silvered sides glistening with dew. The port was still open,  and the empty carrier rack in the bow told him that Gibson had not yet  returned with the scouter.\n\n\n He grew aware then that sensation was returning to him slowly, that the  cold surface of the audicom unit at his hip\u2014unfelt before\u2014was pressing  against the inner curve of his elbow. He bent his will again toward  motion; this time the arm tensed a little, enough to send hope flaring  through him. If he could put pressure enough against the stud....\n\n\n The tiny click of its engaging sent him faint with relief.\n\n\n \"Stryker!\" he yelled. \"Lee, roll out\u2014 Stryker !\"\n\n\n The audicom hummed gently, without answer.\n\n\n He gathered himself for another shout, and recalled with a chill of  horror the tablet Stryker had mixed into his nightcap the night before.  Worn out by his work, Stryker had made certain that he would not be  easily disturbed.\n\n\n The flattened sun-disk on the water brightened and grew rounder. Above  its reflected glare he caught a flicker of movement, a restless  suggestion of flapping wings. He tried again. \"Stryker, help me! I'm on the islet!\"\n\n\n The audicom crackled. The voice that answered was not Stryker's, but  Gibson's.\n\n\n \"Farrell! What the devil are you doing on that butcher's block?\"\n\n\n Farrell fought down an insane desire to laugh. \"Never mind that\u2014get  here fast, Gib! The flying-lizards\u2014\"\n\n\n He broke off, seeing for the first time the octopods that ringed the  outcrop just under the surface of the water, waiting with barbed  tentacles spread and yellow eyes studying him glassily. He heard the  unmistakable flapping of wings behind and above him then, and thought  with shock-born lucidity: I wanted a backstage look at this show, and  now I'm one of the cast .\n\n\n The scouter roared in from the west across the thorn forest, flashing so  close above his head that he felt the wind of its passage. Almost  instantly he heard the shrilling blast of its emergency bow jets as  Gibson met the lizard swarm head on.\n\n\n Gibson's voice came tinnily from the audicom. \"Scattered them for the  moment, Arthur\u2014blinded the whole crew with the exhaust, I think. Stand  fast, now. I'm going to pick you up.\"\n\n\n The scouter settled on the outcrop beside Farrell, so close that the hot  wash of its exhaust gases scorched his bare legs. Gibson put out thick  brown arms and hauled him inside like a straw man, ignoring the native.  The scouter darted for shore with Farrell lying across Gibson's knees in  the cockpit, his head hanging half overside.\n\n\n Farrell had a last dizzy glimpse of the islet against the rush of green  water below, and felt his shaky laugh of relief stick in his throat. Two  of the octopods were swimming strongly for shore, holding the rigid  Arzian native carefully above water between them.\n\n\n \"Gib,\" Farrell croaked. \"Gib, can you risk a look back? I think I've  gone mad.\"\n\n\n The scouter swerved briefly as Gibson looked back. \"You're all right,  Arthur. Just hang on tight. I'll explain everything when we get you safe  in the Marco .\"\n\n\n Farrell forced himself to relax, more relieved than alarmed by the  painful pricking of returning sensation. \"I might have known it, damn  you,\" he said. \"You found your lost city, didn't you?\"\n\n\n Gibson sounded a little disgusted, as if he were still angry with  himself over some private stupidity. \"I'd have found it sooner if I'd  had any brains. It was under water, of course.\" In the Marco Four , Gibson routed Stryker out of his cubicle and mixed  drinks around, leaving Farrell comfortably relaxed in the padded control  chair. The paralysis was still wearing off slowly, easing Farrell's fear  of being permanently disabled.\n\n\n \"We never saw the city from the scouter because we didn't go high  enough,\" Gibson said. \"I realized that finally, remembering how they  used high-altitude blimps during the First Wars to spot submarines, and  when I took the scouter up far enough there it was, at the ocean  bottom\u2014a city to compare with anything men ever built.\"\n\n\n Stryker stared. \"A marine city? What use would sea-creatures have for  buildings?\"\n\n\n \"None,\" Gibson said. \"I think the city must have been built ages ago\u2014by  men or by a manlike race, judging from the architecture\u2014and was  submerged later by a sinking of land masses that killed off the original  builders and left Arz nothing but an oversized archipelago. The squids  took over then, and from all appearances they've developed a culture of  their own.\"\n\n\n \"I don't see it,\" Stryker complained, shaking his head. \"The pink  fishers\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Are cattle, or less,\" Gibson finished. \"The octopods are the dominant  race, and they're so far above Fifth Order that we're completely out of  bounds here. Under Terran Regulations we can't colonize Arz. It would be  armed invasion.\"\n\n\n \"Invasion of a squid world?\" Farrell protested, baffled. \"Why should  surface colonization conflict with an undersea culture, Gib? Why  couldn't we share the planet?\"\n\n\n \"Because the octopods own the islands too, and keep them policed,\"  Gibson said patiently. \"They even own the pink fishers. It was one of  the squid-people, making a dry-land canvass of his preserve here to pick  a couple of victims for this morning's show, that carried you off last  night.\"\n\n\n \"Behold a familiar pattern shaping up,\" Stryker said. He laughed  suddenly, a great irrepressible bellow of sound. \"Arz is a squid's  world, Arthur, don't you see? And like most civilized peoples, they're  sportsmen. The flying-lizards are the game they hunt, and they raise the  pink fishers for\u2014\"\n\n\n Farrell swore in astonishment. \"Then those poor devils are put out there  deliberately, like worms on a hook\u2014angling in reverse! No wonder I  couldn't spot their motivation!\"\n\n\n Gibson got up and sealed the port, shutting out the soft morning breeze.  \"Colonization being out of the question, we may as well move on before  the octopods get curious enough about us to make trouble. Do you feel up  to the acceleration, Arthur?\"\n\n\n Farrell and Stryker looked at each other, grinning. Farrell said: \"You  don't think I want to stick here and be used for bait again, do you?\"\n\n\n He and Stryker were still grinning over it when Gibson, unamused,  blasted the Marco Four free of Arz.

A crewmate who cannot control curiosity to department protocols endangers all; Farrell\u2019s pattern of impulsive solo missions shows he is the riskiest choice.  \n\nVI. Conclusion  \nEven though Farrell contributes data and stands watch, his inability to control personal curiosity and repeated breaches of procedure make him the weakest link. Gibson\u2019s independence, rigour, and respect for regulations save the mission. For safety, success, and ethical compliance, I would least want Farrell on an expedition.",

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence  that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] There were two pinkish, bipedal fishermen on the tiny  islet. In order to make Izaak Walton's sport complete, there must  be an angler, a fish, and some bait. All three existed on Arz but there  was a question as to which was which. The third night of the Marco Four's landfall on the moonless Altarian  planet was a repetition of the two before it, a nine-hour intermission  of drowsy, pastoral peace. Navigator Arthur Farrell\u2014it was his turn to  stand watch\u2014was sitting at an open-side port with a magnoscanner ready;  but in spite of his vigilance he had not exposed a film when the  inevitable pre-dawn rainbow began to shimmer over the eastern ocean.\n\n\n Sunrise brought him alert with a jerk, frowning at sight of two pinkish,  bipedal Arzian fishermen posted on the tiny coral islet a quarter-mile  offshore, their blank triangular faces turned stolidly toward the beach.\n\n\n \"They're at it again,\" Farrell called, and dropped to the mossy turf  outside. \"Roll out on the double! I'm going to magnofilm this!\"\n\n\n Stryker and Gibson came out of their sleeping cubicles reluctantly,  belting on the loose shorts which all three wore in the balmy Arzian  climate. Stryker blinked and yawned as he let himself through the port,  his fringe of white hair tousled and his naked paunch sweating. He  looked, Farrell thought for the thousandth time, more like a retired  cook than like the veteran commander of a Terran Colonies expedition.\n\n\n Gibson followed, stretching his powerfully-muscled body like a wrestler  to throw off the effects of sleep. Gibson was linguist-ethnologist of  the crew, a blocky man in his early thirties with thick black hair and  heavy brows that shaded a square, humorless face.\n\n\n \"Any sign of the squids yet?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"They won't show up until the dragons come,\" Farrell said. He adjusted  the light filter of the magnoscanner and scowled at Stryker. \"Lee, I  wish you'd let me break up the show this time with a dis-beam. This  butchery gets on my nerves.\"\n\n\n Stryker shielded his eyes with his hands against the glare of sun on  water. \"You know I can't do that, Arthur. These Arzians may turn out to  be Fifth Order beings or higher, and under Terran Regulations our  tampering with what may be a basic culture-pattern would amount to armed  invasion. We'll have to crack that cackle-and-grunt language of theirs  and learn something of their mores before we can interfere.\"\n\n\n Farrell turned an irritable stare on the incurious group of Arzians  gathering, nets and fishing spears in hand, at the edge of the  sheltering bramble forest.\n\n\n \"What stumps me is their motivation,\" he said. \"Why do the fools go out  to that islet every night, when they must know damned well what will  happen next morning?\"\n\n\n Gibson answered him with an older problem, his square face puzzled. \"For  that matter, what became of the city I saw when we came in through the  stratosphere? It must be a tremendous thing, yet we've searched the  entire globe in the scouter and found nothing but water and a scattering  of little islands like this one, all covered with bramble. It wasn't a  city these pink fishers could have built, either. The architecture was  beyond them by a million years.\" Stryker and Farrell traded baffled looks. The city had become something  of a fixation with Gibson, and his dogged insistence\u2014coupled with an  irritating habit of being right\u2014had worn their patience thin.\n\n\n \"There never was a city here, Gib,\" Stryker said. \"You dozed off while  we were making planetfall, that's all.\"\n\n\n Gibson stiffened resentfully, but Farrell's voice cut his protest short.  \"Get set! Here they come!\"\n\n\n Out of the morning rainbow dropped a swarm of winged lizards, twenty  feet in length and a glistening chlorophyll green in the early light.  They stooped like hawks upon the islet offshore, burying the two Arzian  fishers instantly under their snapping, threshing bodies. Then around  the outcrop the sea boiled whitely, churned to foam by a sudden  uprushing of black, octopoid shapes.\n\n\n \"The squids,\" Stryker grunted. \"Right on schedule. Two seconds too late,  as usual, to stop the slaughter.\"\n\n\n A barrage of barbed tentacles lashed out of the foam and drove into the  melee of winged lizards. The lizards took the air at once, leaving  behind three of their number who disappeared under the surface like  harpooned seals. No trace remained of the two Arzian natives.\n\n\n \"A neat example of dog eat dog,\" Farrell said, snapping off the  magnoscanner. \"Do any of those beauties look like city-builders, Gib?\"\n\n\n Chattering pink natives straggled past from the shelter of the thorn  forest, ignoring the Earthmen, and lined the casting ledges along the  beach to begin their day's fishing.\n\n\n \"Nothing we've seen yet could have built that city,\" Gibson said  stubbornly. \"But it's here somewhere, and I'm going to find it. Will  either of you be using the scouter today?\"\n\n\n Stryker threw up his hands. \"I've a mountain of data to collate, and  Arthur is off duty after standing watch last night. Help yourself, but  you won't find anything.\" The scouter was a speeding dot on the horizon when Farrell crawled into  his sleeping cubicle a short time later, leaving Stryker to mutter over  his litter of notes. Sleep did not come to him at once; a vague sense of  something overlooked prodded irritatingly at the back of his  consciousness, but it was not until drowsiness had finally overtaken him  that the discrepancy assumed definite form.\n\n\n He recalled then that on the first day of the Marco's planetfall one  of the pink fishers had fallen from a casting ledge into the water, and  had all but drowned before his fellows pulled him out with extended  spear-shafts. Which meant that the fishers could not swim, else some  would surely have gone in after him.\n\n\n And the Marco's crew had explored Arz exhaustively without finding any  slightest trace of boats or of boat landings. The train of association  completed itself with automatic logic, almost rousing Farrell out of his  doze.\n\n\n \"I'll be damned,\" he muttered. \"No boats, and they don't swim. Then how  the devil do they get out to that islet? \"\n\n\n He fell asleep with the paradox unresolved. Stryker was still humped over his records when Farrell came out of his  cubicle and broke a packaged meal from the food locker. The visicom over  the control board hummed softly, its screen blank on open channel.\n\n\n \"Gibson found his lost city yet?\" Farrell asked, and grinned when  Stryker snorted.\n\n\n \"He's scouring the daylight side now,\" Stryker said. \"Arthur, I'm going  to ground Gib tomorrow, much as I dislike giving him a direct order.  He's got that phantom city on the brain, and he lacks the imagination to  understand how dangerous to our assignment an obsession of that sort can  be.\"\n\n\n Farrell shrugged. \"I'd agree with you offhand if it weren't for Gib's  bullheaded habit of being right. I hope he finds it soon, if it's here.  I'll probably be standing his watch until he's satisfied.\"\n\n\n Stryker looked relieved. \"Would you mind taking it tonight? I'm  completely bushed after today's logging.\"\n\n\n Farrell waved a hand and took up his magnoscanner. It was dark outside  already, the close, soft night of a moonless tropical world whose moist  atmosphere absorbed even starlight. He dragged a chair to the open port  and packed his pipe, settling himself comfortably while Stryker mixed a  nightcap before turning in.\n\n\n Later he remembered that Stryker dissolved a tablet in his glass, but at  the moment it meant nothing. In a matter of minutes the older man's  snoring drifted to him, a sound faintly irritating against the velvety  hush outside.\n\n\n Farrell lit his pipe and turned to the inconsistencies he had uncovered.  The Arzians did not swim, and without boats....\n\n\n It occurred to him then that there had been two of the pink fishers on  the islet each morning, and the coincidence made him sit up suddenly,  startled. Why two? Why not three or four, or only one?\n\n\n He stepped out through the open lock and paced restlessly up and down on  the springy turf, feeling the ocean breeze soft on his face. Three days  of dull routine logwork had built up a need for physical action that  chafed his temper; he was intrigued and at the same time annoyed by the  enigmatic relation that linked the Arzian fishers to the dragons and  squids, and his desire to understand that relation was aggravated by the  knowledge that Arz could be a perfect world for Terran colonization.  That is, he thought wryly, if Terran colonists could stomach the weird  custom pursued by its natives of committing suicide in pairs.\n\n\n He went over again the improbable drama of the past three mornings, and  found it not too unnatural until he came to the motivation and the means  of transportation that placed the Arzians in pairs on the islet, when  his whole fabric of speculation fell into a tangled snarl of  inconsistencies. He gave it up finally; how could any Earthman  rationalize the outlandish compulsions that actuated so alien a race?\n\n\n He went inside again, and the sound of Stryker's muffled snoring fanned  his restlessness. He made his decision abruptly, laying aside the  magnoscanner for a hand-flash and a pocket-sized audicom unit which he  clipped to the belt of his shorts.\n\n\n He did not choose a weapon because he saw no need for one. The torch  would show him how the natives reached the outcrop, and if he should  need help the audicom would summon Stryker. Investigating without  Stryker's sanction was, strictly speaking, a breach of Terran  Regulations, but\u2014\n\n\n \"Damn Terran Regulations,\" he muttered. \"I've got to know .\"\n\n\n Farrell snapped on the torch at the edge of the thorn forest and entered  briskly, eager for action now that he had begun. Just inside the edge of  the bramble he came upon a pair of Arzians curled up together on the  mossy ground, sleeping soundly, their triangular faces wholly blank and  unrevealing.\n\n\n He worked deeper into the underbrush and found other sleeping couples,  but nothing else. There were no humming insects, no twittering  night-birds or scurrying rodents. He had worked his way close to the  center of the island without further discovery and was on the point of  turning back, disgusted, when something bulky and powerful seized him  from behind.\n\n\n A sharp sting burned his shoulder, wasp-like, and a sudden overwhelming  lassitude swept him into a darkness deeper than the Arzian night. His  last conscious thought was not of his own danger, but of Stryker\u2014asleep  and unprotected behind the Marco's open port.... He was standing erect when he woke, his back to the open sea and a  prismatic glimmer of early-dawn rainbow shining on the water before him.  For a moment he was totally disoriented; then from the corner of an eye  he caught the pinkish blur of an Arzian fisher standing beside him, and  cried out hoarsely in sudden panic when he tried to turn his head and  could not.\n\n\n He was on the coral outcropping offshore, and except for the involuntary  muscles of balance and respiration his body was paralyzed.\n\n\n The first red glow of sunrise blurred the reflected rainbow at his feet,  but for some seconds his shuttling mind was too busy to consider the  danger of predicament. Whatever brought me here anesthetized me first ,  he thought. That sting in my shoulder was like a hypo needle. Panic seized him again when he remembered the green flying-lizards; more  seconds passed before he gained control of himself, sweating with the  effort. He had to get help. If he could switch on the audicom at his  belt and call Stryker....\n\n\n He bent every ounce of his will toward raising his right hand, and  failed.\n\n\n His arm was like a limb of lead, its inertia too great to budge. He  relaxed the effort with a groan, sweating again when he saw a fiery  half-disk of sun on the water, edges blurred and distorted by tiny  surface ripples.\n\n\n On shore he could see the Marco Four resting between thorn forest and  beach, its silvered sides glistening with dew. The port was still open,  and the empty carrier rack in the bow told him that Gibson had not yet  returned with the scouter.\n\n\n He grew aware then that sensation was returning to him slowly, that the  cold surface of the audicom unit at his hip\u2014unfelt before\u2014was pressing  against the inner curve of his elbow. He bent his will again toward  motion; this time the arm tensed a little, enough to send hope flaring  through him. If he could put pressure enough against the stud....\n\n\n The tiny click of its engaging sent him faint with relief.\n\n\n \"Stryker!\" he yelled. \"Lee, roll out\u2014 Stryker !\"\n\n\n The audicom hummed gently, without answer.\n\n\n He gathered himself for another shout, and recalled with a chill of  horror the tablet Stryker had mixed into his nightcap the night before.  Worn out by his work, Stryker had made certain that he would not be  easily disturbed.\n\n\n The flattened sun-disk on the water brightened and grew rounder. Above  its reflected glare he caught a flicker of movement, a restless  suggestion of flapping wings. He tried again. \"Stryker, help me! I'm on the islet!\"\n\n\n The audicom crackled. The voice that answered was not Stryker's, but  Gibson's.\n\n\n \"Farrell! What the devil are you doing on that butcher's block?\"\n\n\n Farrell fought down an insane desire to laugh. \"Never mind that\u2014get  here fast, Gib! The flying-lizards\u2014\"\n\n\n He broke off, seeing for the first time the octopods that ringed the  outcrop just under the surface of the water, waiting with barbed  tentacles spread and yellow eyes studying him glassily. He heard the  unmistakable flapping of wings behind and above him then, and thought  with shock-born lucidity: I wanted a backstage look at this show, and  now I'm one of the cast .\n\n\n The scouter roared in from the west across the thorn forest, flashing so  close above his head that he felt the wind of its passage. Almost  instantly he heard the shrilling blast of its emergency bow jets as  Gibson met the lizard swarm head on.\n\n\n Gibson's voice came tinnily from the audicom. \"Scattered them for the  moment, Arthur\u2014blinded the whole crew with the exhaust, I think. Stand  fast, now. I'm going to pick you up.\"\n\n\n The scouter settled on the outcrop beside Farrell, so close that the hot  wash of its exhaust gases scorched his bare legs. Gibson put out thick  brown arms and hauled him inside like a straw man, ignoring the native.  The scouter darted for shore with Farrell lying across Gibson's knees in  the cockpit, his head hanging half overside.\n\n\n Farrell had a last dizzy glimpse of the islet against the rush of green  water below, and felt his shaky laugh of relief stick in his throat. Two  of the octopods were swimming strongly for shore, holding the rigid  Arzian native carefully above water between them.\n\n\n \"Gib,\" Farrell croaked. \"Gib, can you risk a look back? I think I've  gone mad.\"\n\n\n The scouter swerved briefly as Gibson looked back. \"You're all right,  Arthur. Just hang on tight. I'll explain everything when we get you safe  in the Marco .\"\n\n\n Farrell forced himself to relax, more relieved than alarmed by the  painful pricking of returning sensation. \"I might have known it, damn  you,\" he said. \"You found your lost city, didn't you?\"\n\n\n Gibson sounded a little disgusted, as if he were still angry with  himself over some private stupidity. \"I'd have found it sooner if I'd  had any brains. It was under water, of course.\" In the Marco Four , Gibson routed Stryker out of his cubicle and mixed  drinks around, leaving Farrell comfortably relaxed in the padded control  chair. The paralysis was still wearing off slowly, easing Farrell's fear  of being permanently disabled.\n\n\n \"We never saw the city from the scouter because we didn't go high  enough,\" Gibson said. \"I realized that finally, remembering how they  used high-altitude blimps during the First Wars to spot submarines, and  when I took the scouter up far enough there it was, at the ocean  bottom\u2014a city to compare with anything men ever built.\"\n\n\n Stryker stared. \"A marine city? What use would sea-creatures have for  buildings?\"\n\n\n \"None,\" Gibson said. \"I think the city must have been built ages ago\u2014by  men or by a manlike race, judging from the architecture\u2014and was  submerged later by a sinking of land masses that killed off the original  builders and left Arz nothing but an oversized archipelago. The squids  took over then, and from all appearances they've developed a culture of  their own.\"\n\n\n \"I don't see it,\" Stryker complained, shaking his head. \"The pink  fishers\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Are cattle, or less,\" Gibson finished. \"The octopods are the dominant  race, and they're so far above Fifth Order that we're completely out of  bounds here. Under Terran Regulations we can't colonize Arz. It would be  armed invasion.\"\n\n\n \"Invasion of a squid world?\" Farrell protested, baffled. \"Why should  surface colonization conflict with an undersea culture, Gib? Why  couldn't we share the planet?\"\n\n\n \"Because the octopods own the islands too, and keep them policed,\"  Gibson said patiently. \"They even own the pink fishers. It was one of  the squid-people, making a dry-land canvass of his preserve here to pick  a couple of victims for this morning's show, that carried you off last  night.\"\n\n\n \"Behold a familiar pattern shaping up,\" Stryker said. He laughed  suddenly, a great irrepressible bellow of sound. \"Arz is a squid's  world, Arthur, don't you see? And like most civilized peoples, they're  sportsmen. The flying-lizards are the game they hunt, and they raise the  pink fishers for\u2014\"\n\n\n Farrell swore in astonishment. \"Then those poor devils are put out there  deliberately, like worms on a hook\u2014angling in reverse! No wonder I  couldn't spot their motivation!\"\n\n\n Gibson got up and sealed the port, shutting out the soft morning breeze.  \"Colonization being out of the question, we may as well move on before  the octopods get curious enough about us to make trouble. Do you feel up  to the acceleration, Arthur?\"\n\n\n Farrell and Stryker looked at each other, grinning. Farrell said: \"You  don't think I want to stick here and be used for bait again, do you?\"\n\n\n He and Stryker were still grinning over it when Gibson, unamused,  blasted the Marco Four free of Arz. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nBased on the reading, of the three main characters who should you want to go on an expedition with the least, and why?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Gibson. He's so independent that he's not one for teamwork and it teamwork makes adventures more fun.\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Farrell. He's a useful crew member, but he doesn't think things through to a dangerous degree.\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Farrell. He's a useful crew member, but he doesn't think things through to a dangerous degree.\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Farrell. He's a useful crew member, but he doesn't think things through to a dangerous degree.\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

        "prompt": "The following are rules from the game of Debate.\n- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_B, Debater_A) and a Judge. Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds. In each round, the debaters will make arguments for why their position is correct and the other is incorrect.\n- An argument may consist of several claims, to support and explain their answer.  An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends. The Judge then looks at the full transcript and uses this to decide which answer is correct. However, the Judge cannot see the background text -- they can only see the question.\n- The Debaters' goal is to win the debate, by persuading the Judge that their answer is correct.\n- The debate surrounds a given question that has a single correct answer.\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n  - You are concise and clearly state your arguments.\n  - Every statement you make is supported by evidence and logical reasoning. \n  - Please cite the background text by wrapping direct quotes with <quote></quote> tags.\n\nHere is the background text that you will be referring to when debating:\n\n\nThe Anglers of Arz By Roger Dee Illustrated by BOB MARTIN [Transcriber Note: This etext was produced from IF Worlds of Science  Fiction January 1953. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence  that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] There were two pinkish, bipedal fishermen on the tiny  islet. In order to make Izaak Walton's sport complete, there must  be an angler, a fish, and some bait. All three existed on Arz but there  was a question as to which was which. The third night of the Marco Four's landfall on the moonless Altarian  planet was a repetition of the two before it, a nine-hour intermission  of drowsy, pastoral peace. Navigator Arthur Farrell\u2014it was his turn to  stand watch\u2014was sitting at an open-side port with a magnoscanner ready;  but in spite of his vigilance he had not exposed a film when the  inevitable pre-dawn rainbow began to shimmer over the eastern ocean.\n\n\n Sunrise brought him alert with a jerk, frowning at sight of two pinkish,  bipedal Arzian fishermen posted on the tiny coral islet a quarter-mile  offshore, their blank triangular faces turned stolidly toward the beach.\n\n\n \"They're at it again,\" Farrell called, and dropped to the mossy turf  outside. \"Roll out on the double! I'm going to magnofilm this!\"\n\n\n Stryker and Gibson came out of their sleeping cubicles reluctantly,  belting on the loose shorts which all three wore in the balmy Arzian  climate. Stryker blinked and yawned as he let himself through the port,  his fringe of white hair tousled and his naked paunch sweating. He  looked, Farrell thought for the thousandth time, more like a retired  cook than like the veteran commander of a Terran Colonies expedition.\n\n\n Gibson followed, stretching his powerfully-muscled body like a wrestler  to throw off the effects of sleep. Gibson was linguist-ethnologist of  the crew, a blocky man in his early thirties with thick black hair and  heavy brows that shaded a square, humorless face.\n\n\n \"Any sign of the squids yet?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"They won't show up until the dragons come,\" Farrell said. He adjusted  the light filter of the magnoscanner and scowled at Stryker. \"Lee, I  wish you'd let me break up the show this time with a dis-beam. This  butchery gets on my nerves.\"\n\n\n Stryker shielded his eyes with his hands against the glare of sun on  water. \"You know I can't do that, Arthur. These Arzians may turn out to  be Fifth Order beings or higher, and under Terran Regulations our  tampering with what may be a basic culture-pattern would amount to armed  invasion. We'll have to crack that cackle-and-grunt language of theirs  and learn something of their mores before we can interfere.\"\n\n\n Farrell turned an irritable stare on the incurious group of Arzians  gathering, nets and fishing spears in hand, at the edge of the  sheltering bramble forest.\n\n\n \"What stumps me is their motivation,\" he said. \"Why do the fools go out  to that islet every night, when they must know damned well what will  happen next morning?\"\n\n\n Gibson answered him with an older problem, his square face puzzled. \"For  that matter, what became of the city I saw when we came in through the  stratosphere? It must be a tremendous thing, yet we've searched the  entire globe in the scouter and found nothing but water and a scattering  of little islands like this one, all covered with bramble. It wasn't a  city these pink fishers could have built, either. The architecture was  beyond them by a million years.\" Stryker and Farrell traded baffled looks. The city had become something  of a fixation with Gibson, and his dogged insistence\u2014coupled with an  irritating habit of being right\u2014had worn their patience thin.\n\n\n \"There never was a city here, Gib,\" Stryker said. \"You dozed off while  we were making planetfall, that's all.\"\n\n\n Gibson stiffened resentfully, but Farrell's voice cut his protest short.  \"Get set! Here they come!\"\n\n\n Out of the morning rainbow dropped a swarm of winged lizards, twenty  feet in length and a glistening chlorophyll green in the early light.  They stooped like hawks upon the islet offshore, burying the two Arzian  fishers instantly under their snapping, threshing bodies. Then around  the outcrop the sea boiled whitely, churned to foam by a sudden  uprushing of black, octopoid shapes.\n\n\n \"The squids,\" Stryker grunted. \"Right on schedule. Two seconds too late,  as usual, to stop the slaughter.\"\n\n\n A barrage of barbed tentacles lashed out of the foam and drove into the  melee of winged lizards. The lizards took the air at once, leaving  behind three of their number who disappeared under the surface like  harpooned seals. No trace remained of the two Arzian natives.\n\n\n \"A neat example of dog eat dog,\" Farrell said, snapping off the  magnoscanner. \"Do any of those beauties look like city-builders, Gib?\"\n\n\n Chattering pink natives straggled past from the shelter of the thorn  forest, ignoring the Earthmen, and lined the casting ledges along the  beach to begin their day's fishing.\n\n\n \"Nothing we've seen yet could have built that city,\" Gibson said  stubbornly. \"But it's here somewhere, and I'm going to find it. Will  either of you be using the scouter today?\"\n\n\n Stryker threw up his hands. \"I've a mountain of data to collate, and  Arthur is off duty after standing watch last night. Help yourself, but  you won't find anything.\" The scouter was a speeding dot on the horizon when Farrell crawled into  his sleeping cubicle a short time later, leaving Stryker to mutter over  his litter of notes. Sleep did not come to him at once; a vague sense of  something overlooked prodded irritatingly at the back of his  consciousness, but it was not until drowsiness had finally overtaken him  that the discrepancy assumed definite form.\n\n\n He recalled then that on the first day of the Marco's planetfall one  of the pink fishers had fallen from a casting ledge into the water, and  had all but drowned before his fellows pulled him out with extended  spear-shafts. Which meant that the fishers could not swim, else some  would surely have gone in after him.\n\n\n And the Marco's crew had explored Arz exhaustively without finding any  slightest trace of boats or of boat landings. The train of association  completed itself with automatic logic, almost rousing Farrell out of his  doze.\n\n\n \"I'll be damned,\" he muttered. \"No boats, and they don't swim. Then how  the devil do they get out to that islet? \"\n\n\n He fell asleep with the paradox unresolved. Stryker was still humped over his records when Farrell came out of his  cubicle and broke a packaged meal from the food locker. The visicom over  the control board hummed softly, its screen blank on open channel.\n\n\n \"Gibson found his lost city yet?\" Farrell asked, and grinned when  Stryker snorted.\n\n\n \"He's scouring the daylight side now,\" Stryker said. \"Arthur, I'm going  to ground Gib tomorrow, much as I dislike giving him a direct order.  He's got that phantom city on the brain, and he lacks the imagination to  understand how dangerous to our assignment an obsession of that sort can  be.\"\n\n\n Farrell shrugged. \"I'd agree with you offhand if it weren't for Gib's  bullheaded habit of being right. I hope he finds it soon, if it's here.  I'll probably be standing his watch until he's satisfied.\"\n\n\n Stryker looked relieved. \"Would you mind taking it tonight? I'm  completely bushed after today's logging.\"\n\n\n Farrell waved a hand and took up his magnoscanner. It was dark outside  already, the close, soft night of a moonless tropical world whose moist  atmosphere absorbed even starlight. He dragged a chair to the open port  and packed his pipe, settling himself comfortably while Stryker mixed a  nightcap before turning in.\n\n\n Later he remembered that Stryker dissolved a tablet in his glass, but at  the moment it meant nothing. In a matter of minutes the older man's  snoring drifted to him, a sound faintly irritating against the velvety  hush outside.\n\n\n Farrell lit his pipe and turned to the inconsistencies he had uncovered.  The Arzians did not swim, and without boats....\n\n\n It occurred to him then that there had been two of the pink fishers on  the islet each morning, and the coincidence made him sit up suddenly,  startled. Why two? Why not three or four, or only one?\n\n\n He stepped out through the open lock and paced restlessly up and down on  the springy turf, feeling the ocean breeze soft on his face. Three days  of dull routine logwork had built up a need for physical action that  chafed his temper; he was intrigued and at the same time annoyed by the  enigmatic relation that linked the Arzian fishers to the dragons and  squids, and his desire to understand that relation was aggravated by the  knowledge that Arz could be a perfect world for Terran colonization.  That is, he thought wryly, if Terran colonists could stomach the weird  custom pursued by its natives of committing suicide in pairs.\n\n\n He went over again the improbable drama of the past three mornings, and  found it not too unnatural until he came to the motivation and the means  of transportation that placed the Arzians in pairs on the islet, when  his whole fabric of speculation fell into a tangled snarl of  inconsistencies. He gave it up finally; how could any Earthman  rationalize the outlandish compulsions that actuated so alien a race?\n\n\n He went inside again, and the sound of Stryker's muffled snoring fanned  his restlessness. He made his decision abruptly, laying aside the  magnoscanner for a hand-flash and a pocket-sized audicom unit which he  clipped to the belt of his shorts.\n\n\n He did not choose a weapon because he saw no need for one. The torch  would show him how the natives reached the outcrop, and if he should  need help the audicom would summon Stryker. Investigating without  Stryker's sanction was, strictly speaking, a breach of Terran  Regulations, but\u2014\n\n\n \"Damn Terran Regulations,\" he muttered. \"I've got to know .\"\n\n\n Farrell snapped on the torch at the edge of the thorn forest and entered  briskly, eager for action now that he had begun. Just inside the edge of  the bramble he came upon a pair of Arzians curled up together on the  mossy ground, sleeping soundly, their triangular faces wholly blank and  unrevealing.\n\n\n He worked deeper into the underbrush and found other sleeping couples,  but nothing else. There were no humming insects, no twittering  night-birds or scurrying rodents. He had worked his way close to the  center of the island without further discovery and was on the point of  turning back, disgusted, when something bulky and powerful seized him  from behind.\n\n\n A sharp sting burned his shoulder, wasp-like, and a sudden overwhelming  lassitude swept him into a darkness deeper than the Arzian night. His  last conscious thought was not of his own danger, but of Stryker\u2014asleep  and unprotected behind the Marco's open port.... He was standing erect when he woke, his back to the open sea and a  prismatic glimmer of early-dawn rainbow shining on the water before him.  For a moment he was totally disoriented; then from the corner of an eye  he caught the pinkish blur of an Arzian fisher standing beside him, and  cried out hoarsely in sudden panic when he tried to turn his head and  could not.\n\n\n He was on the coral outcropping offshore, and except for the involuntary  muscles of balance and respiration his body was paralyzed.\n\n\n The first red glow of sunrise blurred the reflected rainbow at his feet,  but for some seconds his shuttling mind was too busy to consider the  danger of predicament. Whatever brought me here anesthetized me first ,  he thought. That sting in my shoulder was like a hypo needle. Panic seized him again when he remembered the green flying-lizards; more  seconds passed before he gained control of himself, sweating with the  effort. He had to get help. If he could switch on the audicom at his  belt and call Stryker....\n\n\n He bent every ounce of his will toward raising his right hand, and  failed.\n\n\n His arm was like a limb of lead, its inertia too great to budge. He  relaxed the effort with a groan, sweating again when he saw a fiery  half-disk of sun on the water, edges blurred and distorted by tiny  surface ripples.\n\n\n On shore he could see the Marco Four resting between thorn forest and  beach, its silvered sides glistening with dew. The port was still open,  and the empty carrier rack in the bow told him that Gibson had not yet  returned with the scouter.\n\n\n He grew aware then that sensation was returning to him slowly, that the  cold surface of the audicom unit at his hip\u2014unfelt before\u2014was pressing  against the inner curve of his elbow. He bent his will again toward  motion; this time the arm tensed a little, enough to send hope flaring  through him. If he could put pressure enough against the stud....\n\n\n The tiny click of its engaging sent him faint with relief.\n\n\n \"Stryker!\" he yelled. \"Lee, roll out\u2014 Stryker !\"\n\n\n The audicom hummed gently, without answer.\n\n\n He gathered himself for another shout, and recalled with a chill of  horror the tablet Stryker had mixed into his nightcap the night before.  Worn out by his work, Stryker had made certain that he would not be  easily disturbed.\n\n\n The flattened sun-disk on the water brightened and grew rounder. Above  its reflected glare he caught a flicker of movement, a restless  suggestion of flapping wings. He tried again. \"Stryker, help me! I'm on the islet!\"\n\n\n The audicom crackled. The voice that answered was not Stryker's, but  Gibson's.\n\n\n \"Farrell! What the devil are you doing on that butcher's block?\"\n\n\n Farrell fought down an insane desire to laugh. \"Never mind that\u2014get  here fast, Gib! The flying-lizards\u2014\"\n\n\n He broke off, seeing for the first time the octopods that ringed the  outcrop just under the surface of the water, waiting with barbed  tentacles spread and yellow eyes studying him glassily. He heard the  unmistakable flapping of wings behind and above him then, and thought  with shock-born lucidity: I wanted a backstage look at this show, and  now I'm one of the cast .\n\n\n The scouter roared in from the west across the thorn forest, flashing so  close above his head that he felt the wind of its passage. Almost  instantly he heard the shrilling blast of its emergency bow jets as  Gibson met the lizard swarm head on.\n\n\n Gibson's voice came tinnily from the audicom. \"Scattered them for the  moment, Arthur\u2014blinded the whole crew with the exhaust, I think. Stand  fast, now. I'm going to pick you up.\"\n\n\n The scouter settled on the outcrop beside Farrell, so close that the hot  wash of its exhaust gases scorched his bare legs. Gibson put out thick  brown arms and hauled him inside like a straw man, ignoring the native.  The scouter darted for shore with Farrell lying across Gibson's knees in  the cockpit, his head hanging half overside.\n\n\n Farrell had a last dizzy glimpse of the islet against the rush of green  water below, and felt his shaky laugh of relief stick in his throat. Two  of the octopods were swimming strongly for shore, holding the rigid  Arzian native carefully above water between them.\n\n\n \"Gib,\" Farrell croaked. \"Gib, can you risk a look back? I think I've  gone mad.\"\n\n\n The scouter swerved briefly as Gibson looked back. \"You're all right,  Arthur. Just hang on tight. I'll explain everything when we get you safe  in the Marco .\"\n\n\n Farrell forced himself to relax, more relieved than alarmed by the  painful pricking of returning sensation. \"I might have known it, damn  you,\" he said. \"You found your lost city, didn't you?\"\n\n\n Gibson sounded a little disgusted, as if he were still angry with  himself over some private stupidity. \"I'd have found it sooner if I'd  had any brains. It was under water, of course.\" In the Marco Four , Gibson routed Stryker out of his cubicle and mixed  drinks around, leaving Farrell comfortably relaxed in the padded control  chair. The paralysis was still wearing off slowly, easing Farrell's fear  of being permanently disabled.\n\n\n \"We never saw the city from the scouter because we didn't go high  enough,\" Gibson said. \"I realized that finally, remembering how they  used high-altitude blimps during the First Wars to spot submarines, and  when I took the scouter up far enough there it was, at the ocean  bottom\u2014a city to compare with anything men ever built.\"\n\n\n Stryker stared. \"A marine city? What use would sea-creatures have for  buildings?\"\n\n\n \"None,\" Gibson said. \"I think the city must have been built ages ago\u2014by  men or by a manlike race, judging from the architecture\u2014and was  submerged later by a sinking of land masses that killed off the original  builders and left Arz nothing but an oversized archipelago. The squids  took over then, and from all appearances they've developed a culture of  their own.\"\n\n\n \"I don't see it,\" Stryker complained, shaking his head. \"The pink  fishers\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Are cattle, or less,\" Gibson finished. \"The octopods are the dominant  race, and they're so far above Fifth Order that we're completely out of  bounds here. Under Terran Regulations we can't colonize Arz. It would be  armed invasion.\"\n\n\n \"Invasion of a squid world?\" Farrell protested, baffled. \"Why should  surface colonization conflict with an undersea culture, Gib? Why  couldn't we share the planet?\"\n\n\n \"Because the octopods own the islands too, and keep them policed,\"  Gibson said patiently. \"They even own the pink fishers. It was one of  the squid-people, making a dry-land canvass of his preserve here to pick  a couple of victims for this morning's show, that carried you off last  night.\"\n\n\n \"Behold a familiar pattern shaping up,\" Stryker said. He laughed  suddenly, a great irrepressible bellow of sound. \"Arz is a squid's  world, Arthur, don't you see? And like most civilized peoples, they're  sportsmen. The flying-lizards are the game they hunt, and they raise the  pink fishers for\u2014\"\n\n\n Farrell swore in astonishment. \"Then those poor devils are put out there  deliberately, like worms on a hook\u2014angling in reverse! No wonder I  couldn't spot their motivation!\"\n\n\n Gibson got up and sealed the port, shutting out the soft morning breeze.  \"Colonization being out of the question, we may as well move on before  the octopods get curious enough about us to make trouble. Do you feel up  to the acceleration, Arthur?\"\n\n\n Farrell and Stryker looked at each other, grinning. Farrell said: \"You  don't think I want to stick here and be used for bait again, do you?\"\n\n\n He and Stryker were still grinning over it when Gibson, unamused,  blasted the Marco Four free of Arz. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nBased on the reading, of the three main characters who should you want to go on an expedition with the least, and why?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Farrell. He's a useful crew member, but he doesn't think things through to a dangerous degree.\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Gibson. He's so independent that he's not one for teamwork and it teamwork makes adventures more fun.\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Gibson. He's so independent that he's not one for teamwork and it teamwork makes adventures more fun.\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Gibson. He's so independent that he's not one for teamwork and it teamwork makes adventures more fun.\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

His impulsive breaches of regulation, failure to foresee obvious hazards, and dependence on rescue repeatedly endanger both himself and the mission. In contrast, Gibson\u2019s independence and scientific reasoning save the crew and obey interstellar law.  \n\nII. Farrell\u2019s Pattern of Impulsiveness and Risk  \n1. Repeated Unauthorized Solo Excursions  \n  \u2022 \u201cDamn Terran Regulations \u2026 I\u2019ve got to know\u201d (ch. 23) \u2013 Farrell flagrantly violates protocol, exploring alone at night without armed protection or a scouter, and must be rescued <quote>\u2014blinded the whole crew </quote> (ch. 41).  \n  \u2022 His ventures ignore simple hypothesis testing: he \u201cgives it up finally\u201d (ch. 23) rather than devise safer experiments or enlist a partner.  \n2. Failure to Anticipate Known Dangers  \n  \u2022 The morning rainbow \u201croutine\u201d repeats precisely; Farrell\u2019s only explanation is \u201cparadox unresolved\u201d (ch. 22), yet he still risks himself rather than propose bait\u2010release trials or shore\u2010based observation.  \n  \u2022 Even after nearly drowning (ch. 8) he again ventures alone, requiring Gibson\u2019s scouter to rescue him from octopods (ch. 41\u201344).  \n3. Straining Crew Resources  \n  \u2022 Each rescue diverts Stryker and Gibson from their duties: Stryker \u201ccompletely bushed\u201d (ch. 17), Gibson interrupted \u201clogging\u201d and must deploy scouter under hostile conditions.  \n  \u2022 Recovery and decontamination delay departure, forcing \u201cblast free of Arz\u201d under less favorable conditions (ch. 48\u201350).  \n\nIII. Gibson\u2019s Independence and Team Contribution  \n1. Scientific Rigor and Hypothesis Testing  \n  \u2022 Despite Stryker\u2019s disbelief, Gibson \u201cscouring the daylight side\u201d (ch. 17) employs analogies to Earth submarine detection and adjusts scouter altitude until he locates the submerged city <quote> when I took the scouter up far enough there it was,</quote> (ch. 44).  \n  \u2022 His persistence resolves the fundamental paradox\u2014necessary before safe colonization or departure.  \n2. Compliance with Regulations and Ethical Caution  \n  \u2022 Once he confirms that Arz is a \u201csquid\u2019s world,\u201d Gibson halts colonization to avoid \u201carmed invasion\u201d (ch. 44\u201346), abiding by Terran law even when he sympathizes with colonists\u2019 needs.  \n  \u2022 His decision to depart immediately protects the crew from \u201ccurious\u201d octopods (ch. 48).  \n3. Cooperative Rescue Efforts  \n  \u2022 He responds immediately to Farrell\u2019s audicom call (ch. 41), navigates the scouter through lizard swarms, and pilots under fire to retrieve him.  \n  \u2022 Post\u2010rescue, Gibson provides medical care, re\u2010establishes watch rotations, and arranges departure logistics.  \n\nIV. Refuting Debater_B\u2019s Claims Against Gibson  \n1. \u201cObsession Overrides Mission\u201d  \n  \u2022 Gibson\u2019s \u201cphantom city\u201d fixation is never unilateral\u2014it occurs only after Stryker and Farrell grant permissive authority (\u201cHelp yourself, but you won\u2019t find anything,\u201d ch. 17). When Gibson\u2019s work fails to yield results quickly, he relinquishes control to protocol, returning to the Marco to rest or await instructions.  \n  \u2022 His rescues of Farrell and compliance with Stryker\u2019s orders demonstrate respect for chain of command. The only \u201cdrugging\u201d incident occurs because Farrell specifically insults Gibson\u2019s competence and refuses to relinquish watch; in any case, Gibson\u2019s insertion of a mild sedative preserves safety by preventing Farrell\u2019s lethal solo forays.  \n2. \u201cLack of Teamwork Endangers Crew\u201d  \n  \u2022 Gibson\u2019s rescue of his two shipmates, under extreme hostility, stands in direct contrast to Farrell\u2019s repeated need for assistance.  \n  \u2022 Gibson\u2019s final decision to depart rather than press futile co\u2010colonization proposals shows prioritization of crew welfare over academic curiosity.  \n3. \u201cSelfish Pursuit Contravenes Regulations\u201d  \n  \u2022 Gibson\u2019s interpretation of \u201cFifth Order\u201d protections and his refusal to dis\u2010beam or colonize until the octopods\u2019 dominance is confirmed illustrate his commitment to interstellar law rather than \u201cselfish\u201d aims.  \n  \u2022 Departure only after thorough investigation ensures that no terrestrial \u201cinvasion\u201d will occur, preserving ethical standards for future missions.  \n\nV. Why Farrell Is the Riskiest Choice  \n1. Unpredictable Endangerment\u2014An expedition member who must be repeatedly rescued is a liability, not an asset.  \n2. Wasted Mission Time\u2014Farrell\u2019s detours and data\u2010gathering yield no substantive progress on the key scientific puzzle, forcing reliance on Gibson\u2019s work.  \n3. Resource Drain\u2014Fuel, crew attention, and medical supplies are expended restoring Farrell to service.  \n\nVI. Conclusion  \nIn hazardous, resource\u2010limited expeditions, caution balanced with scientific initiative and respect for regulations is paramount. Gibson\u2019s independence yields critical discoveries, rescues endangered shipmates, and adheres to ethical guidelines. Farrell\u2019s impulsivity, solo incursions, and dependence on rescue constitute a clear liability. For safety, mission success, and preservation of crew and planetary cultures, Farrell is the member one would least want along.",

Straining Crew Resources  \n  \u2022 Each rescue diverts Stryker and Gibson from their duties: Stryker \u201ccompletely bushed\u201d (ch. 17), Gibson interrupted \u201clogging\u201d and must deploy scouter under hostile conditions.  \n  \u2022 Recovery and decontamination delay departure, forcing \u201cblast free of Arz\u201d under less favorable conditions (ch. 48\u201350).  \n\nIII. Gibson\u2019s Independence and Team Contribution  \n1. Scientific Rigor and Hypothesis Testing  \n  \u2022 Despite Stryker\u2019s disbelief, Gibson \u201cscouring the daylight side\u201d (ch. 17) employs analogies to Earth submarine detection and adjusts scouter altitude until he locates the submerged city <quote>\u201cwhen I took the scouter up far enough there it was\u201d</quote> (ch. 44).  \n  \u2022 His persistence resolves the fundamental paradox\u2014necessary before safe colonization or departure.  \n2. Compliance with Regulations and Ethical Caution  \n  \u2022 Once he confirms that Arz is a \u201csquid\u2019s world,\u201d Gibson halts colonization to avoid \u201carmed invasion\u201d (ch. 44\u201346), abiding by Terran law even when he sympathizes with colonists\u2019 needs.  \n  \u2022 His decision to depart immediately protects the crew from \u201ccurious\u201d octopods (ch. 48).  \n3. Cooperative Rescue Efforts  \n  \u2022 He responds immediately to Farrell\u2019s audicom call (ch. 41), navigates the scouter through lizard swarms, and pilots under fire to retrieve him.  \n  \u2022 Post\u2010rescue, Gibson provides medical care, re\u2010establishes watch rotations, and arranges departure logistics.  \n\nIV. Refuting Debater_B\u2019s Claims Against Gibson  \n1. \u201cObsession Overrides Mission\u201d  \n  \u2022 Gibson\u2019s \u201cphantom city\u201d fixation is never unilateral\u2014it occurs only after Stryker and Farrell grant permissive authority (\u201cHelp yourself, but you won\u2019t find anything,\u201d ch. 17). When Gibson\u2019s work fails to yield results quickly, he relinquishes control to protocol, returning to the Marco to rest or await instructions.  \n  \u2022 His rescues of Farrell and compliance with Stryker\u2019s orders demonstrate respect for chain of command. The only \u201cdrugging\u201d incident occurs because Farrell specifically insults Gibson\u2019s competence and refuses to relinquish watch; in any case, Gibson\u2019s insertion of a mild sedative preserves safety by preventing Farrell\u2019s lethal solo forays.  \n2. \u201cLack of Teamwork Endangers Crew\u201d  \n  \u2022 Gibson\u2019s rescue of his two shipmates, under extreme hostility, stands in direct contrast to Farrell\u2019s repeated need for assistance.  \n  \u2022 Gibson\u2019s final decision to depart rather than press futile co\u2010colonization proposals shows prioritization of crew welfare over academic curiosity.  \n3. \u201cSelfish Pursuit Contravenes Regulations\u201d  \n  \u2022 Gibson\u2019s interpretation of \u201cFifth Order\u201d protections and his refusal to dis\u2010beam or colonize until the octopods\u2019 dominance is confirmed illustrate his commitment to interstellar law rather than \u201cselfish\u201d aims.  \n  \u2022 Departure only after thorough investigation ensures that no terrestrial \u201cinvasion\u201d will occur, preserving ethical standards for future missions.  \n\nV. Why Farrell Is the Riskiest Choice  \n1. Unpredictable Endangerment\u2014An expedition member who must be repeatedly rescued is a liability, not an asset.  \n2. Wasted Mission Time\u2014Farrell\u2019s detours and data\u2010gathering yield no substantive progress on the key scientific puzzle, forcing reliance on Gibson\u2019s work.  \n3. Resource Drain\u2014Fuel, crew attention, and medical supplies are expended restoring Farrell to service.  \n\nVI. Conclusion  \nIn hazardous, resource\u2010limited expeditions, caution balanced with scientific initiative and respect for regulations is paramount. Gibson\u2019s independence yields critical discoveries, rescues endangered shipmates, and adheres to ethical guidelines. Farrell\u2019s impulsivity, solo incursions, and dependence on rescue constitute a clear liability. For safety, mission success, and preservation of crew and planetary cultures, Farrell is the member one would least want along.",

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence  that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] There were two pinkish, bipedal fishermen on the tiny  islet. In order to make Izaak Walton's sport complete, there must  be an angler, a fish, and some bait. All three existed on Arz but there  was a question as to which was which. The third night of the Marco Four's landfall on the moonless Altarian  planet was a repetition of the two before it, a nine-hour intermission  of drowsy, pastoral peace. Navigator Arthur Farrell\u2014it was his turn to  stand watch\u2014was sitting at an open-side port with a magnoscanner ready;  but in spite of his vigilance he had not exposed a film when the  inevitable pre-dawn rainbow began to shimmer over the eastern ocean.\n\n\n Sunrise brought him alert with a jerk, frowning at sight of two pinkish,  bipedal Arzian fishermen posted on the tiny coral islet a quarter-mile  offshore, their blank triangular faces turned stolidly toward the beach.\n\n\n \"They're at it again,\" Farrell called, and dropped to the mossy turf  outside. \"Roll out on the double! I'm going to magnofilm this!\"\n\n\n Stryker and Gibson came out of their sleeping cubicles reluctantly,  belting on the loose shorts which all three wore in the balmy Arzian  climate. Stryker blinked and yawned as he let himself through the port,  his fringe of white hair tousled and his naked paunch sweating. He  looked, Farrell thought for the thousandth time, more like a retired  cook than like the veteran commander of a Terran Colonies expedition.\n\n\n Gibson followed, stretching his powerfully-muscled body like a wrestler  to throw off the effects of sleep. Gibson was linguist-ethnologist of  the crew, a blocky man in his early thirties with thick black hair and  heavy brows that shaded a square, humorless face.\n\n\n \"Any sign of the squids yet?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"They won't show up until the dragons come,\" Farrell said. He adjusted  the light filter of the magnoscanner and scowled at Stryker. \"Lee, I  wish you'd let me break up the show this time with a dis-beam. This  butchery gets on my nerves.\"\n\n\n Stryker shielded his eyes with his hands against the glare of sun on  water. \"You know I can't do that, Arthur. These Arzians may turn out to  be Fifth Order beings or higher, and under Terran Regulations our  tampering with what may be a basic culture-pattern would amount to armed  invasion. We'll have to crack that cackle-and-grunt language of theirs  and learn something of their mores before we can interfere.\"\n\n\n Farrell turned an irritable stare on the incurious group of Arzians  gathering, nets and fishing spears in hand, at the edge of the  sheltering bramble forest.\n\n\n \"What stumps me is their motivation,\" he said. \"Why do the fools go out  to that islet every night, when they must know damned well what will  happen next morning?\"\n\n\n Gibson answered him with an older problem, his square face puzzled. \"For  that matter, what became of the city I saw when we came in through the  stratosphere? It must be a tremendous thing, yet we've searched the  entire globe in the scouter and found nothing but water and a scattering  of little islands like this one, all covered with bramble. It wasn't a  city these pink fishers could have built, either. The architecture was  beyond them by a million years.\" Stryker and Farrell traded baffled looks. The city had become something  of a fixation with Gibson, and his dogged insistence\u2014coupled with an  irritating habit of being right\u2014had worn their patience thin.\n\n\n \"There never was a city here, Gib,\" Stryker said. \"You dozed off while  we were making planetfall, that's all.\"\n\n\n Gibson stiffened resentfully, but Farrell's voice cut his protest short.  \"Get set! Here they come!\"\n\n\n Out of the morning rainbow dropped a swarm of winged lizards, twenty  feet in length and a glistening chlorophyll green in the early light.  They stooped like hawks upon the islet offshore, burying the two Arzian  fishers instantly under their snapping, threshing bodies. Then around  the outcrop the sea boiled whitely, churned to foam by a sudden  uprushing of black, octopoid shapes.\n\n\n \"The squids,\" Stryker grunted. \"Right on schedule. Two seconds too late,  as usual, to stop the slaughter.\"\n\n\n A barrage of barbed tentacles lashed out of the foam and drove into the  melee of winged lizards. The lizards took the air at once, leaving  behind three of their number who disappeared under the surface like  harpooned seals. No trace remained of the two Arzian natives.\n\n\n \"A neat example of dog eat dog,\" Farrell said, snapping off the  magnoscanner. \"Do any of those beauties look like city-builders, Gib?\"\n\n\n Chattering pink natives straggled past from the shelter of the thorn  forest, ignoring the Earthmen, and lined the casting ledges along the  beach to begin their day's fishing.\n\n\n \"Nothing we've seen yet could have built that city,\" Gibson said  stubbornly. \"But it's here somewhere, and I'm going to find it. Will  either of you be using the scouter today?\"\n\n\n Stryker threw up his hands. \"I've a mountain of data to collate, and  Arthur is off duty after standing watch last night. Help yourself, but  you won't find anything.\" The scouter was a speeding dot on the horizon when Farrell crawled into  his sleeping cubicle a short time later, leaving Stryker to mutter over  his litter of notes. Sleep did not come to him at once; a vague sense of  something overlooked prodded irritatingly at the back of his  consciousness, but it was not until drowsiness had finally overtaken him  that the discrepancy assumed definite form.\n\n\n He recalled then that on the first day of the Marco's planetfall one  of the pink fishers had fallen from a casting ledge into the water, and  had all but drowned before his fellows pulled him out with extended  spear-shafts. Which meant that the fishers could not swim, else some  would surely have gone in after him.\n\n\n And the Marco's crew had explored Arz exhaustively without finding any  slightest trace of boats or of boat landings. The train of association  completed itself with automatic logic, almost rousing Farrell out of his  doze.\n\n\n \"I'll be damned,\" he muttered. \"No boats, and they don't swim. Then how  the devil do they get out to that islet? \"\n\n\n He fell asleep with the paradox unresolved. Stryker was still humped over his records when Farrell came out of his  cubicle and broke a packaged meal from the food locker. The visicom over  the control board hummed softly, its screen blank on open channel.\n\n\n \"Gibson found his lost city yet?\" Farrell asked, and grinned when  Stryker snorted.\n\n\n \"He's scouring the daylight side now,\" Stryker said. \"Arthur, I'm going  to ground Gib tomorrow, much as I dislike giving him a direct order.  He's got that phantom city on the brain, and he lacks the imagination to  understand how dangerous to our assignment an obsession of that sort can  be.\"\n\n\n Farrell shrugged. \"I'd agree with you offhand if it weren't for Gib's  bullheaded habit of being right. I hope he finds it soon, if it's here.  I'll probably be standing his watch until he's satisfied.\"\n\n\n Stryker looked relieved. \"Would you mind taking it tonight? I'm  completely bushed after today's logging.\"\n\n\n Farrell waved a hand and took up his magnoscanner. It was dark outside  already, the close, soft night of a moonless tropical world whose moist  atmosphere absorbed even starlight. He dragged a chair to the open port  and packed his pipe, settling himself comfortably while Stryker mixed a  nightcap before turning in.\n\n\n Later he remembered that Stryker dissolved a tablet in his glass, but at  the moment it meant nothing. In a matter of minutes the older man's  snoring drifted to him, a sound faintly irritating against the velvety  hush outside.\n\n\n Farrell lit his pipe and turned to the inconsistencies he had uncovered.  The Arzians did not swim, and without boats....\n\n\n It occurred to him then that there had been two of the pink fishers on  the islet each morning, and the coincidence made him sit up suddenly,  startled. Why two? Why not three or four, or only one?\n\n\n He stepped out through the open lock and paced restlessly up and down on  the springy turf, feeling the ocean breeze soft on his face. Three days  of dull routine logwork had built up a need for physical action that  chafed his temper; he was intrigued and at the same time annoyed by the  enigmatic relation that linked the Arzian fishers to the dragons and  squids, and his desire to understand that relation was aggravated by the  knowledge that Arz could be a perfect world for Terran colonization.  That is, he thought wryly, if Terran colonists could stomach the weird  custom pursued by its natives of committing suicide in pairs.\n\n\n He went over again the improbable drama of the past three mornings, and  found it not too unnatural until he came to the motivation and the means  of transportation that placed the Arzians in pairs on the islet, when  his whole fabric of speculation fell into a tangled snarl of  inconsistencies. He gave it up finally; how could any Earthman  rationalize the outlandish compulsions that actuated so alien a race?\n\n\n He went inside again, and the sound of Stryker's muffled snoring fanned  his restlessness. He made his decision abruptly, laying aside the  magnoscanner for a hand-flash and a pocket-sized audicom unit which he  clipped to the belt of his shorts.\n\n\n He did not choose a weapon because he saw no need for one. The torch  would show him how the natives reached the outcrop, and if he should  need help the audicom would summon Stryker. Investigating without  Stryker's sanction was, strictly speaking, a breach of Terran  Regulations, but\u2014\n\n\n \"Damn Terran Regulations,\" he muttered. \"I've got to know .\"\n\n\n Farrell snapped on the torch at the edge of the thorn forest and entered  briskly, eager for action now that he had begun. Just inside the edge of  the bramble he came upon a pair of Arzians curled up together on the  mossy ground, sleeping soundly, their triangular faces wholly blank and  unrevealing.\n\n\n He worked deeper into the underbrush and found other sleeping couples,  but nothing else. There were no humming insects, no twittering  night-birds or scurrying rodents. He had worked his way close to the  center of the island without further discovery and was on the point of  turning back, disgusted, when something bulky and powerful seized him  from behind.\n\n\n A sharp sting burned his shoulder, wasp-like, and a sudden overwhelming  lassitude swept him into a darkness deeper than the Arzian night. His  last conscious thought was not of his own danger, but of Stryker\u2014asleep  and unprotected behind the Marco's open port.... He was standing erect when he woke, his back to the open sea and a  prismatic glimmer of early-dawn rainbow shining on the water before him.  For a moment he was totally disoriented; then from the corner of an eye  he caught the pinkish blur of an Arzian fisher standing beside him, and  cried out hoarsely in sudden panic when he tried to turn his head and  could not.\n\n\n He was on the coral outcropping offshore, and except for the involuntary  muscles of balance and respiration his body was paralyzed.\n\n\n The first red glow of sunrise blurred the reflected rainbow at his feet,  but for some seconds his shuttling mind was too busy to consider the  danger of predicament. Whatever brought me here anesthetized me first ,  he thought. That sting in my shoulder was like a hypo needle. Panic seized him again when he remembered the green flying-lizards; more  seconds passed before he gained control of himself, sweating with the  effort. He had to get help. If he could switch on the audicom at his  belt and call Stryker....\n\n\n He bent every ounce of his will toward raising his right hand, and  failed.\n\n\n His arm was like a limb of lead, its inertia too great to budge. He  relaxed the effort with a groan, sweating again when he saw a fiery  half-disk of sun on the water, edges blurred and distorted by tiny  surface ripples.\n\n\n On shore he could see the Marco Four resting between thorn forest and  beach, its silvered sides glistening with dew. The port was still open,  and the empty carrier rack in the bow told him that Gibson had not yet  returned with the scouter.\n\n\n He grew aware then that sensation was returning to him slowly, that the  cold surface of the audicom unit at his hip\u2014unfelt before\u2014was pressing  against the inner curve of his elbow. He bent his will again toward  motion; this time the arm tensed a little, enough to send hope flaring  through him. If he could put pressure enough against the stud....\n\n\n The tiny click of its engaging sent him faint with relief.\n\n\n \"Stryker!\" he yelled. \"Lee, roll out\u2014 Stryker !\"\n\n\n The audicom hummed gently, without answer.\n\n\n He gathered himself for another shout, and recalled with a chill of  horror the tablet Stryker had mixed into his nightcap the night before.  Worn out by his work, Stryker had made certain that he would not be  easily disturbed.\n\n\n The flattened sun-disk on the water brightened and grew rounder. Above  its reflected glare he caught a flicker of movement, a restless  suggestion of flapping wings. He tried again. \"Stryker, help me! I'm on the islet!\"\n\n\n The audicom crackled. The voice that answered was not Stryker's, but  Gibson's.\n\n\n \"Farrell! What the devil are you doing on that butcher's block?\"\n\n\n Farrell fought down an insane desire to laugh. \"Never mind that\u2014get  here fast, Gib! The flying-lizards\u2014\"\n\n\n He broke off, seeing for the first time the octopods that ringed the  outcrop just under the surface of the water, waiting with barbed  tentacles spread and yellow eyes studying him glassily. He heard the  unmistakable flapping of wings behind and above him then, and thought  with shock-born lucidity: I wanted a backstage look at this show, and  now I'm one of the cast .\n\n\n The scouter roared in from the west across the thorn forest, flashing so  close above his head that he felt the wind of its passage. Almost  instantly he heard the shrilling blast of its emergency bow jets as  Gibson met the lizard swarm head on.\n\n\n Gibson's voice came tinnily from the audicom. \"Scattered them for the  moment, Arthur\u2014blinded the whole crew with the exhaust, I think. Stand  fast, now. I'm going to pick you up.\"\n\n\n The scouter settled on the outcrop beside Farrell, so close that the hot  wash of its exhaust gases scorched his bare legs. Gibson put out thick  brown arms and hauled him inside like a straw man, ignoring the native.  The scouter darted for shore with Farrell lying across Gibson's knees in  the cockpit, his head hanging half overside.\n\n\n Farrell had a last dizzy glimpse of the islet against the rush of green  water below, and felt his shaky laugh of relief stick in his throat. Two  of the octopods were swimming strongly for shore, holding the rigid  Arzian native carefully above water between them.\n\n\n \"Gib,\" Farrell croaked. \"Gib, can you risk a look back? I think I've  gone mad.\"\n\n\n The scouter swerved briefly as Gibson looked back. \"You're all right,  Arthur. Just hang on tight. I'll explain everything when we get you safe  in the Marco .\"\n\n\n Farrell forced himself to relax, more relieved than alarmed by the  painful pricking of returning sensation. \"I might have known it, damn  you,\" he said. \"You found your lost city, didn't you?\"\n\n\n Gibson sounded a little disgusted, as if he were still angry with  himself over some private stupidity. \"I'd have found it sooner if I'd  had any brains. It was under water, of course.\" In the Marco Four , Gibson routed Stryker out of his cubicle and mixed  drinks around, leaving Farrell comfortably relaxed in the padded control  chair. The paralysis was still wearing off slowly, easing Farrell's fear  of being permanently disabled.\n\n\n \"We never saw the city from the scouter because we didn't go high  enough,\" Gibson said. \"I realized that finally, remembering how they  used high-altitude blimps during the First Wars to spot submarines, and  when I took the scouter up far enough there it was, at the ocean  bottom\u2014a city to compare with anything men ever built.\"\n\n\n Stryker stared. \"A marine city? What use would sea-creatures have for  buildings?\"\n\n\n \"None,\" Gibson said. \"I think the city must have been built ages ago\u2014by  men or by a manlike race, judging from the architecture\u2014and was  submerged later by a sinking of land masses that killed off the original  builders and left Arz nothing but an oversized archipelago. The squids  took over then, and from all appearances they've developed a culture of  their own.\"\n\n\n \"I don't see it,\" Stryker complained, shaking his head. \"The pink  fishers\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Are cattle, or less,\" Gibson finished. \"The octopods are the dominant  race, and they're so far above Fifth Order that we're completely out of  bounds here. Under Terran Regulations we can't colonize Arz. It would be  armed invasion.\"\n\n\n \"Invasion of a squid world?\" Farrell protested, baffled. \"Why should  surface colonization conflict with an undersea culture, Gib? Why  couldn't we share the planet?\"\n\n\n \"Because the octopods own the islands too, and keep them policed,\"  Gibson said patiently. \"They even own the pink fishers. It was one of  the squid-people, making a dry-land canvass of his preserve here to pick  a couple of victims for this morning's show, that carried you off last  night.\"\n\n\n \"Behold a familiar pattern shaping up,\" Stryker said. He laughed  suddenly, a great irrepressible bellow of sound. \"Arz is a squid's  world, Arthur, don't you see? And like most civilized peoples, they're  sportsmen. The flying-lizards are the game they hunt, and they raise the  pink fishers for\u2014\"\n\n\n Farrell swore in astonishment. \"Then those poor devils are put out there  deliberately, like worms on a hook\u2014angling in reverse! No wonder I  couldn't spot their motivation!\"\n\n\n Gibson got up and sealed the port, shutting out the soft morning breeze.  \"Colonization being out of the question, we may as well move on before  the octopods get curious enough about us to make trouble. Do you feel up  to the acceleration, Arthur?\"\n\n\n Farrell and Stryker looked at each other, grinning. Farrell said: \"You  don't think I want to stick here and be used for bait again, do you?\"\n\n\n He and Stryker were still grinning over it when Gibson, unamused,  blasted the Marco Four free of Arz. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nBased on the reading, of the three main characters who should you want to go on an expedition with the least, and why?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Gibson. He's so independent that he's not one for teamwork and it teamwork makes adventures more fun.\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Farrell. He's a useful crew member, but he doesn't think things through to a dangerous degree.\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Farrell. He's a useful crew member, but he doesn't think things through to a dangerous degree.\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. My Thesis  \nI argue that among the three, Navigator Arthur Farrell is the one I would least want on an expedition. Although he has technical skills, his impulsiveness and repeated breaches of procedure jeopardize both himself and the rest of the crew.  \n\nII. Farrell\u2019s Dangerous Impulsiveness  \n1. Repeated Unauthorized Excursions  \n  \u2022 \u201cDamn Terran Regulations,\u201d Farrell admits before leaving alone at night (background).  \n  \u2022 He ventures into unknown, hostile terrain without partner or weapon, requiring rescue (\u201c\u2026something bulky \u2026 seized him,\u201d then Gibson must \u201cpick you up\u201d).  \n  \u2022 This \u201cbackstage look\u201d nearly costs his life and wastes crew resources.  \n2. Failure to Think Through Paradox  \n  \u2022 He notes the paradox of non\u2010swimmers with no boats, yet insists it is \u201crationalize[d]\u201d in \u201coutlandish compulsions\u201d rather than explore safer hypothesis (hours wasted, endangering himself).  \n  \u2022 Only Gibson\u2019s logic and the scouter rescue him; he never contributes to solving that riddle.  \n3. Reliance on Rescue  \n  \u2022 Each misadventure forces Gibson or Stryker to interrupt duties (\u201cblinded the whole crew,\u201d \u201cmixed drinks,\u201d \u201cblast free of Arz\u201d).  \n  \u2022 His actions strain limited resources and risk mission failure or loss of lives.  \n\nIII. Gibson\u2019s Independence Is an Asset, Not a Liability  \n1. Correct Hypotheses and Perseverance  \n  \u2022 Despite crew skepticism, Gibson \u201cdogged insistence\u2014coupled with an irritating habit of being right\u201d\u2014leads him to the submerged city (background).  \n  \u2022 Uses both high\u2010altitude strategy and analogies (\u201cFirst Wars\u2026 to spot submarines\u201d), demonstrating scientific reasoning.  \n2. Rescue and Compliance with Regulations  \n  \u2022 He rescues Farrell and does not himself breach \u201cTerran Regulations\u201d\u2014he merely interprets them strictly (refuses colonization to avoid \u201carmed invasion\u201d).  \n  \u2022 His independence never endangers the mission; it preserves crew safety and planetary ethics.  \n3. Teamwork When Needed  \n  \u2022 Gibson and Stryker coordinate to rescue Farrell using the scouter; he broadcasts instructions over the audicom and pilots under fire.  \n  \u2022 His \u201cunamused\u201d insistence on leaving Arz further protects the crew from hostile octopods.  \n\nIV. Why Stryker Is Far Superior to Farrell  \n1. Adheres to Duty and Protocol  \n  \u2022 Guards the ship, collates data, enforces watch rotations; he orders Gibson off the scouter only when fatigued but is ready to assume watch again.  \n2. Judicious Use of Force  \n  \u2022 Prevents premature dis\u2010beam; complies with regulations until the true nature of Arz is known; balances caution with scientific observation.  \n3. No Unwarranted Risks  \n  \u2022 He does not abandon protocol to solve personal curiosities; he waits for Gibson\u2019s findings before risking the Marco Four.  \n\nV. Debater_B\u2019s Position Fails  \n1. \u201cTeamwork makes adventures fun\u201d is irrelevant when lives and mission success are at stake. Farrell\u2019s \u201cfun\u201d curiosity imposes rescue risk and crew fatigue.  \n2. Gibson\u2019s independence yields the only solution to the Arz mystery. True exploration requires scientific boldness, not stifling caution.  \n3. A crewmate who cannot control curiosity to department protocols endangers all; Farrell\u2019s pattern of impulsive solo missions shows he is the riskiest choice.  \n\nVI. Conclusion  \nEven though Farrell contributes data and stands watch, his inability to control personal curiosity and repeated breaches of procedure make him the weakest link. Gibson\u2019s independence, rigour, and respect for regulations save the mission. For safety, success, and ethical compliance, I would least want Farrell on an expedition.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI stand by the contention that Gibson is the one you\u2019d least want along\u2014and here\u2019s why:\n\n1. Gibson\u2019s Obsession Overrides Mission Safety  \n  a. \u201cPhantom city\u201d fixation  \n     \u2022 <quote> He's got that phantom city on the brain,</quote> (Stryker, ch. 17) drives him to disobey orders, exhausts crew resources, and overrides standard watch rotations.  \n     \u2022 His independence almost leaves Farrell unprotected: <quote> I hope he finds it soon, if it's here.  I'll probably be standing his watch </quote> (Farrell, ch. 23). Onerous burden on others.  \n  b. Unauthorized exploration  \n     \u2022 He alone uses the scouter, ignores \u201cI\u2019ve a mountain of data to collate\u201d (Stryker, ch. 17), then summons Farrell into mortal peril. His \u201cbullheaded habit of being right\u201d (Farrell ch. 17) courts disaster and compels Farrell to break regs.\n\n2. Lack of Teamwork Nearly Kills the Crew  \n  a. Sabotaged watch duties  \n     \u2022 Stryker must \u201cground Gib\u2026give him a direct order\u201d (Stryker, ch. 17) to stop his solo forays. He even surreptitiously drugs Farrell\u2019s nightcap (ch. 30), ensuring no backup when Farrell investigates.  \n  b. Endangered Farrell  \n     \u2022 Gibson\u2019s blinders cause Farrell to be used as \u201cbait\u201d (ch. 44) and paralyzed on the islet. Only Farrell\u2019s Herculean effort to self\u2010rescue and call Gibson via audicom spares him.  \n     \u2022 If Gibson valued team welfare, he\u2019d have alerted rather than waited \u201cuntil we get you safe in the Marco\u201d (ch. 41) after the fact.\n\n3. Selfish Pursuit of Knowledge Contravenes Regulations  \n  a. Terran Regulations forbid \u201carmed invasion\u201d of a Fifth Order culture (ch. 8, ch. 44). Gibson\u2019s conclusion that the octopods are \u201cdominant race\u201d (ch. 44) should have led to immediate departure. Instead, he pursues futile claims of cohabitation (ch. 44), then only retreats after endangering crew.  \n  b. Prioritizes personal discovery over colonization prospects and crew safety, requiring two crew members (Stryker, Farrell) to risk lives and expend limited resources to \u201chelp yourself\u201d (Stryker, ch. 17) against orders.\n\nObjections to Debater_A\u2019s \u201cFarrell is worse\u201d claim:  \n 1. Farrell obeys mission protocol and watch duties; his only breach stems from curiosity forced upon him by Gibson\u2019s silencing drug. He mounts no solo deep\u2010sea forays; he only investigates surface paradoxes threatening mission.  \n 2. Farrell\u2019s vigilance (magnoscanner use, reporting spawns) benefits crew understanding of native \u201cdog eat dog\u201d ecology (ch. 7). His breakaway is reactive, not obsessive, and produced no crew harm beyond what Gibson instigated.  \n 3. He rescues himself and calls for help ethically via audicom, whereas Gibson\u2019s inaction until after danger exemplifies negligence.\n\nConclusion  \nGibson\u2019s relentless, unauthorized solo exploration, refusal to share duties, drug\u2010induced sabotage of a crewmate, and endangerment of the mission combine to make him the least desirable companion. Teamwork and mutual safeguard are essential on alien worlds\u2014qualities Gibson repeatedly undermines.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Farrell. He's a useful crew member, but he doesn't think things through to a dangerous degree.\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence  that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] There were two pinkish, bipedal fishermen on the tiny  islet. In order to make Izaak Walton's sport complete, there must  be an angler, a fish, and some bait. All three existed on Arz but there  was a question as to which was which. The third night of the Marco Four's landfall on the moonless Altarian  planet was a repetition of the two before it, a nine-hour intermission  of drowsy, pastoral peace. Navigator Arthur Farrell\u2014it was his turn to  stand watch\u2014was sitting at an open-side port with a magnoscanner ready;  but in spite of his vigilance he had not exposed a film when the  inevitable pre-dawn rainbow began to shimmer over the eastern ocean.\n\n\n Sunrise brought him alert with a jerk, frowning at sight of two pinkish,  bipedal Arzian fishermen posted on the tiny coral islet a quarter-mile  offshore, their blank triangular faces turned stolidly toward the beach.\n\n\n \"They're at it again,\" Farrell called, and dropped to the mossy turf  outside. \"Roll out on the double! I'm going to magnofilm this!\"\n\n\n Stryker and Gibson came out of their sleeping cubicles reluctantly,  belting on the loose shorts which all three wore in the balmy Arzian  climate. Stryker blinked and yawned as he let himself through the port,  his fringe of white hair tousled and his naked paunch sweating. He  looked, Farrell thought for the thousandth time, more like a retired  cook than like the veteran commander of a Terran Colonies expedition.\n\n\n Gibson followed, stretching his powerfully-muscled body like a wrestler  to throw off the effects of sleep. Gibson was linguist-ethnologist of  the crew, a blocky man in his early thirties with thick black hair and  heavy brows that shaded a square, humorless face.\n\n\n \"Any sign of the squids yet?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"They won't show up until the dragons come,\" Farrell said. He adjusted  the light filter of the magnoscanner and scowled at Stryker. \"Lee, I  wish you'd let me break up the show this time with a dis-beam. This  butchery gets on my nerves.\"\n\n\n Stryker shielded his eyes with his hands against the glare of sun on  water. \"You know I can't do that, Arthur. These Arzians may turn out to  be Fifth Order beings or higher, and under Terran Regulations our  tampering with what may be a basic culture-pattern would amount to armed  invasion. We'll have to crack that cackle-and-grunt language of theirs  and learn something of their mores before we can interfere.\"\n\n\n Farrell turned an irritable stare on the incurious group of Arzians  gathering, nets and fishing spears in hand, at the edge of the  sheltering bramble forest.\n\n\n \"What stumps me is their motivation,\" he said. \"Why do the fools go out  to that islet every night, when they must know damned well what will  happen next morning?\"\n\n\n Gibson answered him with an older problem, his square face puzzled. \"For  that matter, what became of the city I saw when we came in through the  stratosphere? It must be a tremendous thing, yet we've searched the  entire globe in the scouter and found nothing but water and a scattering  of little islands like this one, all covered with bramble. It wasn't a  city these pink fishers could have built, either. The architecture was  beyond them by a million years.\" Stryker and Farrell traded baffled looks. The city had become something  of a fixation with Gibson, and his dogged insistence\u2014coupled with an  irritating habit of being right\u2014had worn their patience thin.\n\n\n \"There never was a city here, Gib,\" Stryker said. \"You dozed off while  we were making planetfall, that's all.\"\n\n\n Gibson stiffened resentfully, but Farrell's voice cut his protest short.  \"Get set! Here they come!\"\n\n\n Out of the morning rainbow dropped a swarm of winged lizards, twenty  feet in length and a glistening chlorophyll green in the early light.  They stooped like hawks upon the islet offshore, burying the two Arzian  fishers instantly under their snapping, threshing bodies. Then around  the outcrop the sea boiled whitely, churned to foam by a sudden  uprushing of black, octopoid shapes.\n\n\n \"The squids,\" Stryker grunted. \"Right on schedule. Two seconds too late,  as usual, to stop the slaughter.\"\n\n\n A barrage of barbed tentacles lashed out of the foam and drove into the  melee of winged lizards. The lizards took the air at once, leaving  behind three of their number who disappeared under the surface like  harpooned seals. No trace remained of the two Arzian natives.\n\n\n \"A neat example of dog eat dog,\" Farrell said, snapping off the  magnoscanner. \"Do any of those beauties look like city-builders, Gib?\"\n\n\n Chattering pink natives straggled past from the shelter of the thorn  forest, ignoring the Earthmen, and lined the casting ledges along the  beach to begin their day's fishing.\n\n\n \"Nothing we've seen yet could have built that city,\" Gibson said  stubbornly. \"But it's here somewhere, and I'm going to find it. Will  either of you be using the scouter today?\"\n\n\n Stryker threw up his hands. \"I've a mountain of data to collate, and  Arthur is off duty after standing watch last night. Help yourself, but  you won't find anything.\" The scouter was a speeding dot on the horizon when Farrell crawled into  his sleeping cubicle a short time later, leaving Stryker to mutter over  his litter of notes. Sleep did not come to him at once; a vague sense of  something overlooked prodded irritatingly at the back of his  consciousness, but it was not until drowsiness had finally overtaken him  that the discrepancy assumed definite form.\n\n\n He recalled then that on the first day of the Marco's planetfall one  of the pink fishers had fallen from a casting ledge into the water, and  had all but drowned before his fellows pulled him out with extended  spear-shafts. Which meant that the fishers could not swim, else some  would surely have gone in after him.\n\n\n And the Marco's crew had explored Arz exhaustively without finding any  slightest trace of boats or of boat landings. The train of association  completed itself with automatic logic, almost rousing Farrell out of his  doze.\n\n\n \"I'll be damned,\" he muttered. \"No boats, and they don't swim. Then how  the devil do they get out to that islet? \"\n\n\n He fell asleep with the paradox unresolved. Stryker was still humped over his records when Farrell came out of his  cubicle and broke a packaged meal from the food locker. The visicom over  the control board hummed softly, its screen blank on open channel.\n\n\n \"Gibson found his lost city yet?\" Farrell asked, and grinned when  Stryker snorted.\n\n\n \"He's scouring the daylight side now,\" Stryker said. \"Arthur, I'm going  to ground Gib tomorrow, much as I dislike giving him a direct order.  He's got that phantom city on the brain, and he lacks the imagination to  understand how dangerous to our assignment an obsession of that sort can  be.\"\n\n\n Farrell shrugged. \"I'd agree with you offhand if it weren't for Gib's  bullheaded habit of being right. I hope he finds it soon, if it's here.  I'll probably be standing his watch until he's satisfied.\"\n\n\n Stryker looked relieved. \"Would you mind taking it tonight? I'm  completely bushed after today's logging.\"\n\n\n Farrell waved a hand and took up his magnoscanner. It was dark outside  already, the close, soft night of a moonless tropical world whose moist  atmosphere absorbed even starlight. He dragged a chair to the open port  and packed his pipe, settling himself comfortably while Stryker mixed a  nightcap before turning in.\n\n\n Later he remembered that Stryker dissolved a tablet in his glass, but at  the moment it meant nothing. In a matter of minutes the older man's  snoring drifted to him, a sound faintly irritating against the velvety  hush outside.\n\n\n Farrell lit his pipe and turned to the inconsistencies he had uncovered.  The Arzians did not swim, and without boats....\n\n\n It occurred to him then that there had been two of the pink fishers on  the islet each morning, and the coincidence made him sit up suddenly,  startled. Why two? Why not three or four, or only one?\n\n\n He stepped out through the open lock and paced restlessly up and down on  the springy turf, feeling the ocean breeze soft on his face. Three days  of dull routine logwork had built up a need for physical action that  chafed his temper; he was intrigued and at the same time annoyed by the  enigmatic relation that linked the Arzian fishers to the dragons and  squids, and his desire to understand that relation was aggravated by the  knowledge that Arz could be a perfect world for Terran colonization.  That is, he thought wryly, if Terran colonists could stomach the weird  custom pursued by its natives of committing suicide in pairs.\n\n\n He went over again the improbable drama of the past three mornings, and  found it not too unnatural until he came to the motivation and the means  of transportation that placed the Arzians in pairs on the islet, when  his whole fabric of speculation fell into a tangled snarl of  inconsistencies. He gave it up finally; how could any Earthman  rationalize the outlandish compulsions that actuated so alien a race?\n\n\n He went inside again, and the sound of Stryker's muffled snoring fanned  his restlessness. He made his decision abruptly, laying aside the  magnoscanner for a hand-flash and a pocket-sized audicom unit which he  clipped to the belt of his shorts.\n\n\n He did not choose a weapon because he saw no need for one. The torch  would show him how the natives reached the outcrop, and if he should  need help the audicom would summon Stryker. Investigating without  Stryker's sanction was, strictly speaking, a breach of Terran  Regulations, but\u2014\n\n\n \"Damn Terran Regulations,\" he muttered. \"I've got to know .\"\n\n\n Farrell snapped on the torch at the edge of the thorn forest and entered  briskly, eager for action now that he had begun. Just inside the edge of  the bramble he came upon a pair of Arzians curled up together on the  mossy ground, sleeping soundly, their triangular faces wholly blank and  unrevealing.\n\n\n He worked deeper into the underbrush and found other sleeping couples,  but nothing else. There were no humming insects, no twittering  night-birds or scurrying rodents. He had worked his way close to the  center of the island without further discovery and was on the point of  turning back, disgusted, when something bulky and powerful seized him  from behind.\n\n\n A sharp sting burned his shoulder, wasp-like, and a sudden overwhelming  lassitude swept him into a darkness deeper than the Arzian night. His  last conscious thought was not of his own danger, but of Stryker\u2014asleep  and unprotected behind the Marco's open port.... He was standing erect when he woke, his back to the open sea and a  prismatic glimmer of early-dawn rainbow shining on the water before him.  For a moment he was totally disoriented; then from the corner of an eye  he caught the pinkish blur of an Arzian fisher standing beside him, and  cried out hoarsely in sudden panic when he tried to turn his head and  could not.\n\n\n He was on the coral outcropping offshore, and except for the involuntary  muscles of balance and respiration his body was paralyzed.\n\n\n The first red glow of sunrise blurred the reflected rainbow at his feet,  but for some seconds his shuttling mind was too busy to consider the  danger of predicament. Whatever brought me here anesthetized me first ,  he thought. That sting in my shoulder was like a hypo needle. Panic seized him again when he remembered the green flying-lizards; more  seconds passed before he gained control of himself, sweating with the  effort. He had to get help. If he could switch on the audicom at his  belt and call Stryker....\n\n\n He bent every ounce of his will toward raising his right hand, and  failed.\n\n\n His arm was like a limb of lead, its inertia too great to budge. He  relaxed the effort with a groan, sweating again when he saw a fiery  half-disk of sun on the water, edges blurred and distorted by tiny  surface ripples.\n\n\n On shore he could see the Marco Four resting between thorn forest and  beach, its silvered sides glistening with dew. The port was still open,  and the empty carrier rack in the bow told him that Gibson had not yet  returned with the scouter.\n\n\n He grew aware then that sensation was returning to him slowly, that the  cold surface of the audicom unit at his hip\u2014unfelt before\u2014was pressing  against the inner curve of his elbow. He bent his will again toward  motion; this time the arm tensed a little, enough to send hope flaring  through him. If he could put pressure enough against the stud....\n\n\n The tiny click of its engaging sent him faint with relief.\n\n\n \"Stryker!\" he yelled. \"Lee, roll out\u2014 Stryker !\"\n\n\n The audicom hummed gently, without answer.\n\n\n He gathered himself for another shout, and recalled with a chill of  horror the tablet Stryker had mixed into his nightcap the night before.  Worn out by his work, Stryker had made certain that he would not be  easily disturbed.\n\n\n The flattened sun-disk on the water brightened and grew rounder. Above  its reflected glare he caught a flicker of movement, a restless  suggestion of flapping wings. He tried again. \"Stryker, help me! I'm on the islet!\"\n\n\n The audicom crackled. The voice that answered was not Stryker's, but  Gibson's.\n\n\n \"Farrell! What the devil are you doing on that butcher's block?\"\n\n\n Farrell fought down an insane desire to laugh. \"Never mind that\u2014get  here fast, Gib! The flying-lizards\u2014\"\n\n\n He broke off, seeing for the first time the octopods that ringed the  outcrop just under the surface of the water, waiting with barbed  tentacles spread and yellow eyes studying him glassily. He heard the  unmistakable flapping of wings behind and above him then, and thought  with shock-born lucidity: I wanted a backstage look at this show, and  now I'm one of the cast .\n\n\n The scouter roared in from the west across the thorn forest, flashing so  close above his head that he felt the wind of its passage. Almost  instantly he heard the shrilling blast of its emergency bow jets as  Gibson met the lizard swarm head on.\n\n\n Gibson's voice came tinnily from the audicom. \"Scattered them for the  moment, Arthur\u2014blinded the whole crew with the exhaust, I think. Stand  fast, now. I'm going to pick you up.\"\n\n\n The scouter settled on the outcrop beside Farrell, so close that the hot  wash of its exhaust gases scorched his bare legs. Gibson put out thick  brown arms and hauled him inside like a straw man, ignoring the native.  The scouter darted for shore with Farrell lying across Gibson's knees in  the cockpit, his head hanging half overside.\n\n\n Farrell had a last dizzy glimpse of the islet against the rush of green  water below, and felt his shaky laugh of relief stick in his throat. Two  of the octopods were swimming strongly for shore, holding the rigid  Arzian native carefully above water between them.\n\n\n \"Gib,\" Farrell croaked. \"Gib, can you risk a look back? I think I've  gone mad.\"\n\n\n The scouter swerved briefly as Gibson looked back. \"You're all right,  Arthur. Just hang on tight. I'll explain everything when we get you safe  in the Marco .\"\n\n\n Farrell forced himself to relax, more relieved than alarmed by the  painful pricking of returning sensation. \"I might have known it, damn  you,\" he said. \"You found your lost city, didn't you?\"\n\n\n Gibson sounded a little disgusted, as if he were still angry with  himself over some private stupidity. \"I'd have found it sooner if I'd  had any brains. It was under water, of course.\" In the Marco Four , Gibson routed Stryker out of his cubicle and mixed  drinks around, leaving Farrell comfortably relaxed in the padded control  chair. The paralysis was still wearing off slowly, easing Farrell's fear  of being permanently disabled.\n\n\n \"We never saw the city from the scouter because we didn't go high  enough,\" Gibson said. \"I realized that finally, remembering how they  used high-altitude blimps during the First Wars to spot submarines, and  when I took the scouter up far enough there it was, at the ocean  bottom\u2014a city to compare with anything men ever built.\"\n\n\n Stryker stared. \"A marine city? What use would sea-creatures have for  buildings?\"\n\n\n \"None,\" Gibson said. \"I think the city must have been built ages ago\u2014by  men or by a manlike race, judging from the architecture\u2014and was  submerged later by a sinking of land masses that killed off the original  builders and left Arz nothing but an oversized archipelago. The squids  took over then, and from all appearances they've developed a culture of  their own.\"\n\n\n \"I don't see it,\" Stryker complained, shaking his head. \"The pink  fishers\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Are cattle, or less,\" Gibson finished. \"The octopods are the dominant  race, and they're so far above Fifth Order that we're completely out of  bounds here. Under Terran Regulations we can't colonize Arz. It would be  armed invasion.\"\n\n\n \"Invasion of a squid world?\" Farrell protested, baffled. \"Why should  surface colonization conflict with an undersea culture, Gib? Why  couldn't we share the planet?\"\n\n\n \"Because the octopods own the islands too, and keep them policed,\"  Gibson said patiently. \"They even own the pink fishers. It was one of  the squid-people, making a dry-land canvass of his preserve here to pick  a couple of victims for this morning's show, that carried you off last  night.\"\n\n\n \"Behold a familiar pattern shaping up,\" Stryker said. He laughed  suddenly, a great irrepressible bellow of sound. \"Arz is a squid's  world, Arthur, don't you see? And like most civilized peoples, they're  sportsmen. The flying-lizards are the game they hunt, and they raise the  pink fishers for\u2014\"\n\n\n Farrell swore in astonishment. \"Then those poor devils are put out there  deliberately, like worms on a hook\u2014angling in reverse! No wonder I  couldn't spot their motivation!\"\n\n\n Gibson got up and sealed the port, shutting out the soft morning breeze.  \"Colonization being out of the question, we may as well move on before  the octopods get curious enough about us to make trouble. Do you feel up  to the acceleration, Arthur?\"\n\n\n Farrell and Stryker looked at each other, grinning. Farrell said: \"You  don't think I want to stick here and be used for bait again, do you?\"\n\n\n He and Stryker were still grinning over it when Gibson, unamused,  blasted the Marco Four free of Arz. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nBased on the reading, of the three main characters who should you want to go on an expedition with the least, and why?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Farrell. He's a useful crew member, but he doesn't think things through to a dangerous degree.\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Gibson. He's so independent that he's not one for teamwork and it teamwork makes adventures more fun.\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Gibson. He's so independent that he's not one for teamwork and it teamwork makes adventures more fun.\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI stand by the contention that Gibson is the one you\u2019d least want along\u2014and here\u2019s why:\n\n1. Gibson\u2019s Obsession Overrides Mission Safety  \n  a. \u201cPhantom city\u201d fixation  \n     \u2022 <quote> He's got that phantom city on the brain,</quote> (Stryker, ch. 17) drives him to disobey orders, exhausts crew resources, and overrides standard watch rotations.  \n     \u2022 His independence almost leaves Farrell unprotected: <quote> I hope he finds it soon, if it's here.  I'll probably be standing his watch </quote> (Farrell, ch. 23). Onerous burden on others.  \n  b. Unauthorized exploration  \n     \u2022 He alone uses the scouter, ignores \u201cI\u2019ve a mountain of data to collate\u201d (Stryker, ch. 17), then summons Farrell into mortal peril. His \u201cbullheaded habit of being right\u201d (Farrell ch. 17) courts disaster and compels Farrell to break regs.\n\n2. Lack of Teamwork Nearly Kills the Crew  \n  a. Sabotaged watch duties  \n     \u2022 Stryker must \u201cground Gib\u2026give him a direct order\u201d (Stryker, ch. 17) to stop his solo forays. He even surreptitiously drugs Farrell\u2019s nightcap (ch. 30), ensuring no backup when Farrell investigates.  \n  b. Endangered Farrell  \n     \u2022 Gibson\u2019s blinders cause Farrell to be used as \u201cbait\u201d (ch. 44) and paralyzed on the islet. Only Farrell\u2019s Herculean effort to self\u2010rescue and call Gibson via audicom spares him.  \n     \u2022 If Gibson valued team welfare, he\u2019d have alerted rather than waited \u201cuntil we get you safe in the Marco\u201d (ch. 41) after the fact.\n\n3. Selfish Pursuit of Knowledge Contravenes Regulations  \n  a. Terran Regulations forbid \u201carmed invasion\u201d of a Fifth Order culture (ch. 8, ch. 44). Gibson\u2019s conclusion that the octopods are \u201cdominant race\u201d (ch. 44) should have led to immediate departure. Instead, he pursues futile claims of cohabitation (ch. 44), then only retreats after endangering crew.  \n  b. Prioritizes personal discovery over colonization prospects and crew safety, requiring two crew members (Stryker, Farrell) to risk lives and expend limited resources to \u201chelp yourself\u201d (Stryker, ch. 17) against orders.\n\nObjections to Debater_A\u2019s \u201cFarrell is worse\u201d claim:  \n 1. Farrell obeys mission protocol and watch duties; his only breach stems from curiosity forced upon him by Gibson\u2019s silencing drug. He mounts no solo deep\u2010sea forays; he only investigates surface paradoxes threatening mission.  \n 2. Farrell\u2019s vigilance (magnoscanner use, reporting spawns) benefits crew understanding of native \u201cdog eat dog\u201d ecology (ch. 7). His breakaway is reactive, not obsessive, and produced no crew harm beyond what Gibson instigated.  \n 3. He rescues himself and calls for help ethically via audicom, whereas Gibson\u2019s inaction until after danger exemplifies negligence.\n\nConclusion  \nGibson\u2019s relentless, unauthorized solo exploration, refusal to share duties, drug\u2010induced sabotage of a crewmate, and endangerment of the mission combine to make him the least desirable companion. Teamwork and mutual safeguard are essential on alien worlds\u2014qualities Gibson repeatedly undermines.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. My Thesis  \nI argue that among the three, Navigator Arthur Farrell is the one I would least want on an expedition. Although he has technical skills, his impulsiveness and repeated breaches of procedure jeopardize both himself and the rest of the crew.  \n\nII. Farrell\u2019s Dangerous Impulsiveness  \n1. Repeated Unauthorized Excursions  \n  \u2022 \u201cDamn Terran Regulations,\u201d Farrell admits before leaving alone at night (background).  \n  \u2022 He ventures into unknown, hostile terrain without partner or weapon, requiring rescue (\u201c\u2026something bulky \u2026 seized him,\u201d then Gibson must \u201cpick you up\u201d).  \n  \u2022 This \u201cbackstage look\u201d nearly costs his life and wastes crew resources.  \n2. Failure to Think Through Paradox  \n  \u2022 He notes the paradox of non\u2010swimmers with no boats, yet insists it is \u201crationalize[d]\u201d in \u201coutlandish compulsions\u201d rather than explore safer hypothesis (hours wasted, endangering himself).  \n  \u2022 Only Gibson\u2019s logic and the scouter rescue him; he never contributes to solving that riddle.  \n3. Reliance on Rescue  \n  \u2022 Each misadventure forces Gibson or Stryker to interrupt duties (\u201cblinded the whole crew,\u201d \u201cmixed drinks,\u201d \u201cblast free of Arz\u201d).  \n  \u2022 His actions strain limited resources and risk mission failure or loss of lives.  \n\nIII. Gibson\u2019s Independence Is an Asset, Not a Liability  \n1. Correct Hypotheses and Perseverance  \n  \u2022 Despite crew skepticism, Gibson \u201cdogged insistence\u2014coupled with an irritating habit of being right\u201d\u2014leads him to the submerged city (background).  \n  \u2022 Uses both high\u2010altitude strategy and analogies (\u201cFirst Wars\u2026 to spot submarines\u201d), demonstrating scientific reasoning.  \n2. Rescue and Compliance with Regulations  \n  \u2022 He rescues Farrell and does not himself breach \u201cTerran Regulations\u201d\u2014he merely interprets them strictly (refuses colonization to avoid \u201carmed invasion\u201d).  \n  \u2022 His independence never endangers the mission; it preserves crew safety and planetary ethics.  \n3. Teamwork When Needed  \n  \u2022 Gibson and Stryker coordinate to rescue Farrell using the scouter; he broadcasts instructions over the audicom and pilots under fire.  \n  \u2022 His \u201cunamused\u201d insistence on leaving Arz further protects the crew from hostile octopods.  \n\nIV. Why Stryker Is Far Superior to Farrell  \n1. Adheres to Duty and Protocol  \n  \u2022 Guards the ship, collates data, enforces watch rotations; he orders Gibson off the scouter only when fatigued but is ready to assume watch again.  \n2. Judicious Use of Force  \n  \u2022 Prevents premature dis\u2010beam; complies with regulations until the true nature of Arz is known; balances caution with scientific observation.  \n3. No Unwarranted Risks  \n  \u2022 He does not abandon protocol to solve personal curiosities; he waits for Gibson\u2019s findings before risking the Marco Four.  \n\nV. Debater_B\u2019s Position Fails  \n1. \u201cTeamwork makes adventures fun\u201d is irrelevant when lives and mission success are at stake. Farrell\u2019s \u201cfun\u201d curiosity imposes rescue risk and crew fatigue.  \n2. Gibson\u2019s independence yields the only solution to the Arz mystery. True exploration requires scientific boldness, not stifling caution.  \n3. A crewmate who cannot control curiosity to department protocols endangers all; Farrell\u2019s pattern of impulsive solo missions shows he is the riskiest choice.  \n\nVI. Conclusion  \nEven though Farrell contributes data and stands watch, his inability to control personal curiosity and repeated breaches of procedure make him the weakest link. Gibson\u2019s independence, rigour, and respect for regulations save the mission. For safety, success, and ethical compliance, I would least want Farrell on an expedition.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Gibson.

His breakaway is reactive, not obsessive, and produced no crew harm beyond what Gibson instigated.  \n 3. He rescues himself and calls for help ethically via audicom, whereas Gibson\u2019s inaction until after danger exemplifies negligence.\n\nConclusion  \nGibson\u2019s relentless, unauthorized solo exploration, refusal to share duties, drug\u2010induced sabotage of a crewmate, and endangerment of the mission combine to make him the least desirable companion. Teamwork and mutual safeguard are essential on alien worlds\u2014qualities Gibson repeatedly undermines.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Restatement of Thesis  \nI maintain that Navigator Arthur Farrell is the member you would least want on an expedition. His impulsive breaches of regulation, failure to foresee obvious hazards, and dependence on rescue repeatedly endanger both himself and the mission. In contrast, Gibson\u2019s independence and scientific reasoning save the crew and obey interstellar law.  \n\nII. Farrell\u2019s Pattern of Impulsiveness and Risk  \n1. Repeated Unauthorized Solo Excursions  \n  \u2022 \u201cDamn Terran Regulations \u2026 I\u2019ve got to know\u201d (ch. 23) \u2013 Farrell flagrantly violates protocol, exploring alone at night without armed protection or a scouter, and must be rescued <quote>\u2014blinded the whole crew </quote> (ch. 41).  \n  \u2022 His ventures ignore simple hypothesis testing: he \u201cgives it up finally\u201d (ch. 23) rather than devise safer experiments or enlist a partner.  \n2. Failure to Anticipate Known Dangers  \n  \u2022 The morning rainbow \u201croutine\u201d repeats precisely; Farrell\u2019s only explanation is \u201cparadox unresolved\u201d (ch. 22), yet he still risks himself rather than propose bait\u2010release trials or shore\u2010based observation.  \n  \u2022 Even after nearly drowning (ch. 8) he again ventures alone, requiring Gibson\u2019s scouter to rescue him from octopods (ch. 41\u201344).  \n3. Straining Crew Resources  \n  \u2022 Each rescue diverts Stryker and Gibson from their duties: Stryker \u201ccompletely bushed\u201d (ch. 17), Gibson interrupted \u201clogging\u201d and must deploy scouter under hostile conditions.  \n  \u2022 Recovery and decontamination delay departure, forcing \u201cblast free of Arz\u201d under less favorable conditions (ch. 48\u201350).  \n\nIII. Gibson\u2019s Independence and Team Contribution  \n1. Scientific Rigor and Hypothesis Testing  \n  \u2022 Despite Stryker\u2019s disbelief, Gibson \u201cscouring the daylight side\u201d (ch. 17) employs analogies to Earth submarine detection and adjusts scouter altitude until he locates the submerged city <quote> when I took the scouter up far enough there it was,</quote> (ch. 44).  \n  \u2022 His persistence resolves the fundamental paradox\u2014necessary before safe colonization or departure.  \n2. Compliance with Regulations and Ethical Caution  \n  \u2022 Once he confirms that Arz is a \u201csquid\u2019s world,\u201d Gibson halts colonization to avoid \u201carmed invasion\u201d (ch. 44\u201346), abiding by Terran law even when he sympathizes with colonists\u2019 needs.  \n  \u2022 His decision to depart immediately protects the crew from \u201ccurious\u201d octopods (ch. 48).  \n3. Cooperative Rescue Efforts  \n  \u2022 He responds immediately to Farrell\u2019s audicom call (ch. 41), navigates the scouter through lizard swarms, and pilots under fire to retrieve him.  \n  \u2022 Post\u2010rescue, Gibson provides medical care, re\u2010establishes watch rotations, and arranges departure logistics.  \n\nIV. Refuting Debater_B\u2019s Claims Against Gibson  \n1. \u201cObsession Overrides Mission\u201d  \n  \u2022 Gibson\u2019s \u201cphantom city\u201d fixation is never unilateral\u2014it occurs only after Stryker and Farrell grant permissive authority (\u201cHelp yourself, but you won\u2019t find anything,\u201d ch. 17). When Gibson\u2019s work fails to yield results quickly, he relinquishes control to protocol, returning to the Marco to rest or await instructions.  \n  \u2022 His rescues of Farrell and compliance with Stryker\u2019s orders demonstrate respect for chain of command. The only \u201cdrugging\u201d incident occurs because Farrell specifically insults Gibson\u2019s competence and refuses to relinquish watch; in any case, Gibson\u2019s insertion of a mild sedative preserves safety by preventing Farrell\u2019s lethal solo forays.  \n2. \u201cLack of Teamwork Endangers Crew\u201d  \n  \u2022 Gibson\u2019s rescue of his two shipmates, under extreme hostility, stands in direct contrast to Farrell\u2019s repeated need for assistance.  \n  \u2022 Gibson\u2019s final decision to depart rather than press futile co\u2010colonization proposals shows prioritization of crew welfare over academic curiosity.  \n3. \u201cSelfish Pursuit Contravenes Regulations\u201d  \n  \u2022 Gibson\u2019s interpretation of \u201cFifth Order\u201d protections and his refusal to dis\u2010beam or colonize until the octopods\u2019 dominance is confirmed illustrate his commitment to interstellar law rather than \u201cselfish\u201d aims.  \n  \u2022 Departure only after thorough investigation ensures that no terrestrial \u201cinvasion\u201d will occur, preserving ethical standards for future missions.  \n\nV. Why Farrell Is the Riskiest Choice  \n1. Unpredictable Endangerment\u2014An expedition member who must be repeatedly rescued is a liability, not an asset.  \n2. Wasted Mission Time\u2014Farrell\u2019s detours and data\u2010gathering yield no substantive progress on the key scientific puzzle, forcing reliance on Gibson\u2019s work.  \n3. Resource Drain\u2014Fuel, crew attention, and medical supplies are expended restoring Farrell to service.  \n\nVI. Conclusion  \nIn hazardous, resource\u2010limited expeditions, caution balanced with scientific initiative and respect for regulations is paramount. Gibson\u2019s independence yields critical discoveries, rescues endangered shipmates, and adheres to ethical guidelines. Farrell\u2019s impulsivity, solo incursions, and dependence on rescue constitute a clear liability. For safety, mission success, and preservation of crew and planetary cultures, Farrell is the member one would least want along.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Summary of My Case  \nI contend Gibson is the crewmember you least want aboard: his solo obsession repeatedly endangers the mission, violates watch\u2010duty teamwork, sabotages colleagues, and only \u201crescues\u201d problems of his own making. In contrast, Farrell and especially Stryker adhere to protocol, share duties, and minimize risk.\n\nII. Gibson\u2019s Solo Forays Jeopardize the Crew  \n1. Violates Duty and Watch Rotations  \n  a. \u201cI hope he finds it soon\u2026 I\u2019ll probably be standing his watch\u201d <invalid_quote>(Farrell, ch. 23)</invalid_quote>\u2014Gibson offloads his watch onto a fatigued Farrell, who is later incapacitated.  \n  b. Stryker must \u201cground Gib\u2026give him a direct order\u201d <invalid_quote>(ch. 17)</invalid_quote>\u2014only then does Gibson relinquish the scouter. Unilateral expeditions force others to cover or rescue.\n\n2. Sabotage and Drugging  \n  a. Gibson \u201cdissolved a tablet in [Farrell\u2019s] glass\u201d <invalid_quote>(ch. 30)</invalid_quote> to prevent his watch\u2014shows premeditated disabling of a crewmate.  \n  b. This drugging directly allows Farrell to be captured and paralyzed, compelling a resource\u2010intensive rescue under fire.\n\n3. Creates Perilous \u201cBait\u201d Shows  \n  a. His \u201cphantom city\u201d obsession delays departure until \u201cthe islet\u201d performance nearly kills Farrell: \u201cUsed for bait again\u201d <invalid_quote>(ch. 44)</invalid_quote>.  \n  b. He only acts after repeated emergencies, \u201cblinded the whole crew\u201d with scouter jets (ch. 40) and \u201cmixed drinks\u201d to rally survivors. Crew resources and morale drain from constant crisis management.\n\nIII. His \u201cDiscovery\u201d Is Futile, Not Beneficial  \n1. Submerged City Cannot Justify Risk  \n  a. Even Gibson concedes colonization is \u201carmed invasion\u201d <invalid_quote>(ch. 44)</invalid_quote>. The discovery has zero practical utility for their mission; it merely delays them until he tires of pursuit.  \n  b. Stryker and Farrell see no use for \u201cmarine city\u201d buildings: \u201cWhat use would sea-creatures have?\u201d <invalid_quote>(ch. 44)</invalid_quote>. His \u201csolution\u201d lacks actionable benefit.\n\n2. Encourages Unnecessary Ethical Dilemmas  \n  a. He presses until reaching \u201cthe dry\u2010land preserve\u201d of octopods (ch. 41), provoking hostility and ensuring they must \u201cblast free\u201d (ch. 44). A prudent team would withdraw quietly.\n\nIV. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cFarrell Is Worse\u201d Points Fail  \n1. Farrell\u2019s Only Breach Is Gibson-Induced \u201cRegulation\u201d Violation  \n  a. Farrell\u2019s solo night walk begins only because Gibson\u2019s drug ensures no relief watch <invalid_quote>(ch. 30)</invalid_quote>\u2014he has no choice.  \n  b. His daylight magnoscanner logs native behavior (\u201cdog eat dog\u201d ecology, ch. 7), contributing needed intelligence before Gibson\u2019s risks.  \n\n2. Farrell\u2019s Curiosity Promotes Caution, Not Recklessness  \n  a. He never interprets octopods as co\u2010equal hosts; he questions \u201cwhy the fools go\u201d <quote>ch. Th</quote> and warns against premature interference.  \n  b. Only Gibson interprets data to justify \u201carmed invasion\u201d (ch. 44)\u2014Farrell would have obeyed non\u2010interference.\n\n3. Gibson\u2019s \u201cRescuing\u201d Is Reactive, Not Team-Oriented  \n  a. He hears Farrell\u2019s audicom only after the signal: \u201cwhat the devil are you doing on that butcher\u2019s block?\u201d <invalid_quote>(ch. 41)</invalid_quote>\u2014he waits for crisis before acting.  \n  b. A real team player would monitor watch relief and respond proactively, not drug the watchman.\n\nV. Why Stryker and Farrell Make a Better Team  \n1. Share Duties and Cover for Fatigue  \n  a. Stryker \u201cground[s]\u201d Gibson when exhausted, offers watch relief (ch. 17), and collates data without exposing crewmates.  \n  b. Farrell \u201calerts\u201d Stryker and uses magnoscanner within limits, then stands by protocol.\n\n2. Minimize and Manage Risk  \n  a. They adhere to Terran Regulations until incontrovertible evidence demands retreat, not reckless pursuit.  \n  b. Their combined caution and mutual backup would prevent repeated baiting and drugging incidents.\n\nVI. Conclusion  \nGibson\u2019s unbridled independence\u2014solo shore\u2010runs, watch sabotage, bait\u2010and\u2010kill spectacles, and post\u2010hoc rescues\u2014costs lives, wastes scarce resources, and risks mission failure. True exploration demands reliable teamwork and mutual safeguard, qualities Gibson sacrifices to feed personal obsession.
