    "background_text": "The Gravity Business By JAMES E. GUNN\n\n\n Illustrated by ASHMAN\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Galaxy January 1956.  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright  on this publication was renewed.] This little alien beggar could dictate his own terms, but how could  he\u2014and how could anyone find out what those terms might be? The flivver descended vertically toward the green planet circling the  old, orange sun.\n\n\n It was a spaceship, but not the kind men had once dreamed about. The  flivver was shaped like a crude bullet, blunt at one end of a fat  cylinder and tapering abruptly to a point at the other. It had been  slapped together out of sheet metal and insulation board, and it sold,  fully equipped, for $15,730. It didn't behave like a spaceship, either.\n\n\n As it hurtled down, its speed increased with dramatic swiftness. Then,  at the last instant before impact, it stopped. Just like that.\n\n\n A moment later, it thumped a last few inches into the ankle-deep grass  and knee-high white flowers of the meadow. It was a shock of a jar that  made the sheet-metal walls boom like thunder machines. The flivver  rocked unsteadily on its flat stern before it decided to stay upright.\n\n\n Then all was quiet\u2014outside.\n\n\n Inside the big, central cabin, Grampa waved his pircuit irately in the  air. \"Now look what you made me do! Just when I had the blamed thing  practically whipped, too!\" Grampa was a white-haired 90-year-old who could still go a fast round  or two with a man (or woman) half his age, but he had a habit of  lapsing into tantrum when he got annoyed.\n\n\n \"Now, Grampa,\" Fred soothed, but his face was concerned. Fred, once  called Young Fred, was Grampa's only son. He was sixty and his hair had  begun to gray at the temples. \"That landing was pretty rough, Junior.\" Junior was Fred's only son. Because he was thirty-five and capable  of exercising adult judgment and because he had the youngest adult  reflexes, he sat in the pilot's chair, the control stick between his  knees, his thumb still over the Off-On button on top. \"I know it,  Fred,\" he said, frowning. \"This world fooled me. It has a diameter  less than that of Mercury and yet a gravitational pull as great as  Earth.\"\n\n\n Grampa started to say something, but an 8-year-old boy looked up from  the navigator's table beside the big computer and said, \"Well, gosh,  Junior, that's why we picked this planet. We fed all the orbital data  into Abacus, and Abacus said that orbital perturbations indicated that  the second planet was unusually heavy for its size. Then Fred said,  'That looks like heavy metals', and you said, 'Maybe uranium\u2014'\"\n\n\n \"That's enough, Four,\" Junior interrupted. \"Never mind what I said.\"\n\n\n Those were the Peppergrass men, four generations of them, looking  remarkably alike, although some vital element seemed to have dwindled  until Four looked pale and thin-faced and wizened.\n\n\n \"And, Four,\" Reba said automatically, \"don't call your father 'Junior.'  It sounds disrespectful.\"\n\n\n Reba was Four's mother and Junior's wife. On her own, she was a  red-haired beauty with the loveliest figure this side of Antares. That  Junior had won her was, to Grampa, the most hopeful thing he had ever  noticed about the boy.\n\n\n \"But everybody calls Junior 'Junior,'\" Four complained. \"Besides, Fred  is Junior's father and Junior calls him 'Fred.'\"\n\n\n \"That's different,\" Reba said.\n\n\n Grampa was still waving his puzzle circuit indignantly. \"See!\" The  pircuit was a flat box equipped with pushbuttons and thirteen slender  openings in the top. One of the openings was lighted. \"That landing  made me push the wrong button and the dad-blasted thing beat me again.\"\n\n\n \"Stop picking on Junior,\" Joyce said sharply. She was Junior's mother  and Fred's wife, still slim and handsome as she approached sixty, but  somehow ice water had replaced the warm blood in her veins. \"I'm sure  he did the best he could.\"\n\n\n \"Anybody talks about gravitational pull,\" Grampa said, snorting,  \"deserves anything anybody could say about him. There's no such thing,  Junior. You ought to know by now that gravitation is the effect of the  curving of space-time around matter. Einstein proved that two hundred  years ago.\"\n\n\n \"Go back to your games, Grampa,\" Fred said impatiently. \"We've got work  to do.\" Grampa knitted his bushy, white eyebrows and petulantly pushed the last  button on his pircuit. The last light went out. \"You've got work to  do, have you? Whose flivver do you think this is, anyhow?\"\n\n\n \"It belongs to all of us,\" Four said shrilly. \"You gave us all a sixth  share.\"\n\n\n \"That's right, Four,\" Grampa muttered, \"so I did. But whose money  bought it?\"\n\n\n \"You bought it, Grampa,\" Fred said.\n\n\n \"That's right! And who invented the gravity polarizer and the space  flivver? Eh? Who made possible this gallivanting all over space?\"\n\n\n \"You, Grampa,\" Fred said.\n\n\n \"You bet! And who made one hundred million dollars out of it that the  rest of you vultures are just hanging around to gobble up when I die?\"\n\n\n \"And who spent it all trying to invent perpetual motion machines and  longevity pills,\" Joyce said bitterly, \"and fixed it so we'd have to  go searching for uranium and habitable worlds all through this deadly  galaxy? You, Grampa!\"\n\n\n \"Well, now,\" Grampa protested, \"I got a little put away yet. You'll be  sorry when I'm dead and gone.\"\n\n\n \"You're never going to die, Grampa,\" Joyce said harshly. \"Just  before we left, you bought a hundred-year contract with that  Life-Begins-At-Ninety longevity company.\"\n\n\n \"Well, now,\" said Grampa, blinking, \"how'd you find out about that?  Well, now!\" In confusion, he turned back to the pircuit and jabbed a  button. Thirteen slim lights sprang on. \"I'll get you this time!\"\n\n\n Four stretched and stood up. He looked curiously into the corner by the  computer where Grampa's chair stood. \"You brought that pircuit from  Earth, didn't you? What's the game?\"\n\n\n Grampa looked up, obviously relieved to drop his act of intense  concentration. \"I'll tell you, boy. You play against the pircuit,  taking turns, and you can put out one, two or three lights. The player  who makes the other one turn out the last light is the winner.\"\n\n\n \"That's simple,\" Four said without hesitation. \"The winning strategy is  to\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Don't be a kibitzer!\" Grampa snapped. \"When I need help, I'll ask  for it. No dad-blamed machine is gonna outthink Grampa!\" He snorted  indignantly. Four shrugged his narrow shoulders and wandered to the view screen.  Within it was the green horizon, curving noticeably. Four angled the  picture in toward the ship, sweeping through green, peaceful woodland  and plain and blue lake until he stared down into the meadow at the  flivver's stern.\n\n\n \"Look!\" he said suddenly. \"This planet not only has flora\u2014it has  fauna.\" He rushed to the air lock.\n\n\n \"Four!\" Reba called out warningly.\n\n\n \"It's all right, Reba,\" Four assured her. \"The air is within one per  cent of Earth-normal and the bio-analyzer can find no micro-organisms  viable within the Terran spectrum.\"\n\n\n \"What about macro-organisms\u2014\" Reba began, but the boy was gone  already. Reba's face was troubled. \"That boy!\" she said to Junior.  \"Sometimes I think we've made a terrible mistake with him. He should  have friends, play-mates. He's more like a little old man than a boy.\"\n\n\n But Junior nodded meaningfully at Fred and disappeared into the chart  room. Fred followed casually. Then, as the door slid shut behind him,  he asked impatiently. \"Well, what's all the mystery?\"\n\n\n \"No use bothering the others yet,\" Junior said, his face puzzled. \"You  see, I didn't let the flivver drop those last few inches. The polarizer  quit.\"\n\n\n \"Quit!\"\n\n\n \"That's not the worst. I tried to take it up again. The flivver\u2014it  won't budge!\" The thing was a featureless blob, a two-foot sphere of raspberry  gelatin, but it was alive. It rocked back and forth in front of Four.  It opened a raspberry-color pseudo-mouth and said plaintively, \"Fweep?  Fweep?\"\n\n\n Joyce drew her chair farther back toward the wall, revulsion on her  face. \"Four! Get that nasty thing out of here!\" \"You mean Fweep?\" Four asked in astonishment.\n\n\n \"I mean that thing, whatever you call it.\" Joyce fluttered her hand  impatiently. \"Get it out!\"\n\n\n Four's eyes widened farther. \"But Fweep's my friend.\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense!\" Joyce said sharply. \"Earthmen don't make friends with  aliens. And that's nothing but a\u2014a blob!\"\n\n\n \"Fweep?\" queried the raspberry lips. \"Fweep?\"\n\n\n \"If it's Four's friend,\" Reba said firmly, \"it can stay. If you don't  like to be around it, Grammy, you can always go to your own room.\"\n\n\n Joyce stood up indignantly. \"Well! And don't call me 'Grammy!' It makes  me sound as old as that old goat over there!\" She glared malignantly  at Grampa. \"If you'd rather have that blob than me\u2014well!\" She swept  grandly out of the central cabin and into one of the private rooms that  opened out from it.\n\n\n \"Fweep?\" asked the blob.\n\n\n \"Sure,\" Four said. \"Go ahead, fweep\u2014I mean sweep.\"\n\n\n Swiftly the sphere rolled across the floor. Behind it was left a  narrow path of sparkling clean tile.\n\n\n Grampa glanced warily at Joyce's door to make sure it was completely  closed and then cocked a white eyebrow at Reba. \"Good for you, Reba!\"  he said admiringly. \"For forty years now, I've wanted to do that. Never  had the nerve.\"\n\n\n \"Why, thanks, Grampa,\" Reba said, surprised.\n\n\n \"I like you, gal. Never forget it.\"\n\n\n \"I like you, too, Grampa. If you'd been a few years younger, Junior  would have had competition!\"\n\n\n \"You bet he would!\" Grampa leaned back and cackled. Then he leaned  over confidentially toward Reba and whispered, \"Beats me why you ever  married a jerk like Junior, anyhow.\"\n\n\n Reba looked thoughtfully toward the airlock door. \"Maybe I saw  something in him nobody else saw, the man he might become. He's been  submerged in this family too long; he's still a child to all of you  and to himself, too.\" Reba smiled at Grampa brilliantly. \"And maybe I  thought he might grow into a man like his grandfather.\" Grampa turned red and looked quickly toward Four. The boy was staring  intently at Fweep. \"What you doing, Four?\"\n\n\n \"Trying to figure out what Fweep does with the sweepings,\" Four said  absently. \"The outer inch or two of his body gets cloudy and then  slowly clears. I think I'll try him with a bigger particle.\"\n\n\n \"That's the idea, Four. You'll be a Peppergrass yet. How about building  me a pircuit?\"\n\n\n \"You get the other one figured out?\"\n\n\n \"It was easy,\" Grampa said breezily, \"once you understood the  principle. The player who moved second could always win if he used the  right strategy. Dividing the thirteen lights into three sections of  four each\u2014\"\n\n\n \"That's right,\" Four agreed. \"I can make you a new one by cannibalizing  the other pircuit, but I'll need a few extra parts.\"\n\n\n Grampa pushed the wall beside his chair and a drawer slid out of it.\n\n\n Inside were row after row of nipple-topped, flat-sided, flexible  free-fall bottles and a battered cigar box. \"Thought you'd say that,\"  he said, picking out the box. \"Help yourself.\" With the other hand, he  lifted out one of the bottles and took a long drag on it. \"Ahhh!\" he  sighed, wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, and carefully put  the bottle away.\n\n\n \"What is that stuff you drink, Grampa?\" Four asked.\n\n\n \"Tonic, boy. Keeps me young and frisky. Now about that pircuit\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Did you ever work on Niccol\u00f2 Tartaglia's puzzle about the three lovely  brides, the three jealous husbands, the river and the two-passenger  rowboat?\"\n\n\n \"Yep,\" Grampa said. \"Too easy.\"\n\n\n Four thought a moment. \"There's a modern variation with three  missionaries and three cannibals. Same river, same rowboat and only one  of the cannibals can row. If the cannibals outnumber the missionaries\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sounds good, boy,\" Grampa said eagerly. \"Whip it up for me.\"\n\n\n \"Okay, Grampa.\" Four looked at Fweep again. The translucent sphere had  paused at Grampa's feet.\n\n\n Grampa reached down to pat it. For an instant, his hand disappeared  into Fweep, and then the alien creature rolled away. This time its path  seemed crooked.\n\n\n Its gelatinous form jiggled. \"Hic!\" it said. As if in response, the flivver vibrated. Grampa looked querulously  toward the airlock. \"Flivver shouldn't shake like that. Not with the  polarizer turned on.\"\n\n\n The airlock door swung inward. Through the oval doorway walked Fred,  followed closely by Junior. They were sweat-stained and weary,  scintillation counters dangling heavily from their belts.\n\n\n \"Any luck?\" Reba asked brightly.\n\n\n \"Do we look it?\" Junior grumbled.\n\n\n \"Where's Joyce?\" asked Fred. \"Might as well get everybody in on this at  once. Joyce!\"\n\n\n The door to his wife's room opened instantly. Behind it, Joyce was  regal and slim. The pose was spoiled immediately by her avid question:  \"Any uranium? Radium? Thorium?\"\n\n\n \"No,\" Fred said slowly, \"and no other heavy metals, either. There's a  few low-grade iron deposits and that's it.\"\n\n\n \"Then what makes this planet so heavy?\" Reba asked.\n\n\n Junior shrugged helplessly and collapsed into a chair. \"Your guess is  as good as anybody's.\"\n\n\n \"Then we've wasted another week on a worthless rock,\" Joyce complained.  She turned savagely on Fred. \"This was going to make us all filthy  rich. We were going to find radioactives and retire to Earth like  billionaires. And all we've done is spent a year of our lives in this  cramped old flivver\u2014and we don't have many of them to spare!\" She  glared venomously at Grampa.\n\n\n \"We've still got Fweepland,\" Four said solemnly.\n\n\n \"Fweepland?\" Reba repeated.\n\n\n \"This planet. It's not big, but it's fertile and it's harmless. As  real estate, it's worth almost as much as if it were solid uranium.\"\n\n\n \"A good thing, too,\" Junior said glumly, \"because this looks like the  end of our search. Short of a miracle, we'll spend the rest of our  lives right here\u2014involuntary colonists.\"\n\n\n Joyce spun on him. \"You're joking!\" she screeched.\n\n\n \"I wish I were,\" Junior said. \"But the polarizer won't work. Either  it's broken or there's something about the gravity around here that  just won't polarize.\"\n\n\n \"It's these '23 models,\" Grampa put in disgustedly. \"They never were  any good.\" The land of the Fweep turned slowly on its axis. The orange sun set and  rose again and stared down once more at the meadow where the improbable  spaceship rested on its improbable stern. The sixteen Earth hours that  the rotation had taken had changed nothing inside the ship, either.\n\n\n Grampa looked up from his pircuit and said, \"If I were you, Junior, I  would take a good look at the TV repairman when we get back to Earth. If we get back to Earth,\" he amended. \"You can't be Four's father.  All over the Universe, gravity is the same, and if it's gravity, the  polarizer will polarize it.\"\n\n\n \"That's just supposition,\" Junior said stubbornly. \"The fact is, it  isn't because it doesn't. Q.E.D.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe the polarizer is broken,\" Fred suggested.\n\n\n Grampa snorted. \"Broken-shmoken. Nothing to break, Young Fred. Just a  few coils of copper wire and they're all right. We checked. We know  the power plant is working: the lights are on, the air and water  recirculation systems are going, the food resynthesizer is okay. And,  anyway, the polarizer could work from the storage battery if it had to.\"\n\n\n \"Then it goes deeper,\" Junior insisted. \"It goes right to the principle  of polarization itself. For some reason, it doesn't work here. Why?  Before we can discover the answer to that, we'll have to know more  about polarization itself. How does it work, Grampa?\"\n\n\n Grampa gave him a sarcastic grin. \"Now you're curious, eh? Couldn't  be bothered with Grampa's invention before. Oh, no! Too busy. Accept  without question the blessings that the Good Lord provideth\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Let's not get up on any pulpits,\" Fred growled. \"Come on, Grampa,  what's the theory behind polarization?\"\n\n\n Grampa looked at the four faces staring at him hopefully and the  jeering grin turned to a smile. \"Well,\" he said, \"at last. You know  how light is polarized, eh?\" The smile faded. \"No, I guess you don't.\" He cleared his throat professorially. \"Well, now, in ordinary light  the vibrations are perpendicular to the ray in all directions. When  light is polarized by passing through crystals or by reflection or  refraction at non-metallic surfaces, the paths of the vibrations are  still perpendicular to the ray, but they're in straight lines, circles  or ellipses.\"\n\n\n The faces were still blank and unillumined.\n\n\n \"Gravity is similar to light,\" he pressed on. \"In the absence of  matter, gravity is non-polarized. Matter polarizes gravity in a circle  around itself. That's how we've always known it until the invention of  spaceships and later the polarizer. The polarizer polarizes gravity  into a straight line. That makes the ship take off and continue  accelerating until the polarizer is shut off or its angle is shifted.\"\n\n\n The faces looked at him silently. Finally Joyce could endure it no  longer. \"That's just nonsense! You all know it. Grampa's no genius.  He's just a tinkerer. One day he happened to tinker out the polarizer.  He doesn't know how it works any more than I do.\"\n\n\n \"Now wait a minute!\" Grampa protested. \"That's not fair. Maybe  I didn't figure out the theory myself, but I read everything the  scientists ever wrote about it. Wanted to know myself what made the  blamed thing work. What I told you is what the scientists said, near  as I remember. Now me\u2014I'm like Edison. I do it and let everybody else  worry over 'why.'\"\n\n\n \"The only thing you ever did was the polarizer,\" Joyce snapped.  \"And then you spent everything you got from it on those fool  perpetual-motion machines and those crazy longevity schemes when any  moron would know they were impossible.\"\n\n\n Grampa squinted at her sagely. \"That's what they said about the gravity  polarizer before I invented it.\"\n\n\n \"But you don't really know why it works,\" Junior persisted.\n\n\n \"Well, no,\" Grampa admitted. \"Actually I was just fiddling around with  some coils when one of them took off. Went right through the ceiling,  dragging a battery behind it. I guess it's still going. Ought to be out  near the Horsehead Nebula by now. Luckily, I remembered how I'd wound  it.\"\n\n\n \"Why won't the ship work then, if you know so much?\" Joyce demanded  ironically.\n\n\n \"Well, now,\" Grampa said in bafflement, \"it rightly should, you know.\" \"We're stuck,\" Reba said softly. \"We might as well admit it. All we can  do is set the transmitter to send out an automatic distress call\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Which,\" Joyce interrupted, \"might get picked up in a few centuries.\"\n\n\n \"And make the best of what we've got,\" Reba went on, unheeding. \"If we  look at it the right way, it's quite a lot. A beautiful, fertile world.  Earth gravity. The flivver\u2014even if the polarizer won't work, there's  the resynthesizer; it will keep us in food and clothes for years. By  then, we should have a good-sized community built up, because out here  we won't have to stop with one child. We can have all the babies we  want.\"\n\n\n \"You know the law: one child per couple,\" Joyce reminded her frigidly.  \"You can condemn yourself to exile from civilization if you wish. Not  me.\"\n\n\n Junior frowned at his wife. \"I believe you're actually glad it  happened.\"\n\n\n \"I could think of worse things,\" Reba said.\n\n\n \"I like your spunk, Reb,\" Grampa muttered.\n\n\n \"Speaking of children,\" Junior said, \"where's Four?\"\n\n\n \"Here.\" Four came through the airlock and trudged across the room,  carrying a curious contraption made of tripod legs supporting a  small box from which dangled a plumb bob. Behind Four, like a round,  raspberry shadow, rolled Fweep.\n\n\n \"Fweep?\" it queried hopefully.\n\n\n \"Not now,\" said Four.\n\n\n \"Where've you been?\" Reba asked anxiously. \"What've you been doing?\"\n\n\n \"I've been all over Fweepland,\" Four said wearily, \"trying to locate  its center of gravity.\"\n\n\n \"Well?\" Fred prompted.\n\n\n \"It shifts.\"\n\n\n \"That's impossible,\" said Junior.\n\n\n \"Not for Fweep,\" Four replied.\n\n\n \"What do you mean by that?\" Joyce suspiciously asked.\n\n\n \"It shifted,\" Four explained patiently, \"because Fweep kept following  me.\"\n\n\n \"Fweep?\" Junior repeated stupidly.\n\n\n \"Fweep?\" Fweep said eagerly.\n\n\n \"He's why the flivver won't work. What Grampa invented was a linear  polarizer. Fweep is a circular polarizer. He's what makes this planet  so heavy. He's why we can't leave.\" The land of the Fweep rotated once on its axis, and Grampa lowered  the nippled bottle from his lips. He sighed. \"I got it figured out,  Four,\" he said, holding out the pircuit proudly. \"A missionary takes  over a non-rowing type cannibal, leaves him there, and then the rowing  cannibal takes over the other cannibal and leaves him there and\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Not now, Grampa,\" Four said inattentively as he watched Fweep making  the grand tour of the cabin.\n\n\n The raspberry sphere swept over a scattering of crumbs, engulfed them,  absorbed them. Four looked at Joyce. Joyce was watching Fweep, too.\n\n\n \"Rat poison?\" Four asked.\n\n\n Joyce started guiltily. \"How did you know?\"\n\n\n \"There's no use trying to poison Fweep,\" Four said calmly. \"He's got no  enzymes to act on, no nervous system to paralyze. He doesn't even use  what he 'eats' on a molecular level at all.\"\n\n\n \"What level does he use?\" Junior wanted to know.\n\n\n \"Point the scintillation counter at him.\"\n\n\n Junior dug one of the counters out of the supply cabinet and aimed the  pickup at Fweep. The counter began to hum. As Fweep approached, the hum  rose in pitch. As it passed, the hum dropped.\n\n\n Junior looked at the counter's dial. \"He's radioactive, all right. Not  much, but enough. But where does he get the radioactive material?\"\n\n\n \"He uses ordinary matter,\" Four said. \"He must have used up the few  deposits of natural radioactives a long time ago.\"\n\n\n \"He uses ordinary substances on an atomic level?\" Junior said  unbelievingly.\n\n\n Four nodded. \"And that 'skin' of his\u2014whatever it is he uses for  skin\u2014is more efficient in stopping particle emissions than several  feet of lead.\"\n\n\n Fred studied Fweep thoughtfully. \"Maybe we could feed him enough  enriched uranium from the pile to put him over the critical mass.\"\n\n\n \"And blow him up? I don't think it's possible, but even if it were, it  might be a trifle more than disastrous for us.\" Four giggled at the  thought. Joyce glared at him furiously. \"Four! Act your age! We've got to do  something with him. It's preposterous that we should be detained here  at the whim of a mere blob!\"\n\n\n \"I don't figure it's a whim,\" Grampa said. \"Circular gravity is what  he's got to have for one reason or another, so he just naturally bends  the space-time continuum around him\u2014conscious or subconscious, I don't  know. But protoplasm is always more efficient than machines, so the  flivver won't move.\"\n\n\n \"I don't care why that thing does it,\" Joyce said icily. \"I want it  stopped, and the sooner the better. If it won't turn the gravity off,  we'll just have to do away with it.\"\n\n\n \"How?\" asked Four. \"Fweep's skin is pretty close to impervious and  you can't shoot him, stab him or poison him. He doesn't breathe, so  you can't drown or strangle him. You can't imprison him; he 'eats'  everything. And violence might be more dangerous to us than to him.  Right now, Fweep is friendly, but suppose he got mad! He could lower  his radioactive shield or he might increase the gravity by a few times.  Either way, you'd feel rather uncomfortable, Grammy.\"\n\n\n \"Don't call me 'Grammy!' Well, what are we going to do, just sit around  and wait for that thing to die?\"\n\n\n \"We'd have a long wait,\" Four observed. \"Fweep is the only one of his  kind on this planet.\"\n\n\n \"Well?\"\n\n\n \"Probably he's immortal.\"\n\n\n \"And he doesn't reproduce?\" Reba asked sympathetically.\n\n\n \"Probably not. If he doesn't die, there's no point in reproduction.  Reproduction is nature's way of providing racial immortality to mortal  creatures.\"\n\n\n \"But he must have some way of reproduction,\" Reba argued. \"An egg or  something. He couldn't just have sprung into being as he is now.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe he developed,\" Four offered. \"It seems to me that he's bigger  than when we first landed.\" \"He must have been here a long, long time,\"  Fred said. \"Fweepland, as Four calls it, kept its atmosphere and its  water, which a planet this size ordinarily would have lost by now.\" Reba looked at Fweep kindly. \"We can thank the little fellow for that,  anyway.\"\n\n\n \"I thank him for nothing,\" Joyce snapped. \"He lured us down here by  making us think the planet had heavy metals and I want him to let us go immediately !\"\n\n\n Fred turned impatiently on his wife. \"Well, try making him understand!  And if you can make him understand what you want him to do, try making  him do it!\"\n\n\n Joyce looked at Fred with startled eyes. \"Fred!\" she said in a high,  shocked voice and turned blindly toward her room.\n\n\n Grampa lowered his bottle and smacked his lips. \"Well, boy,\" he said to  Fred, \"I thought you'd never do that. Didn't think you had it in you.\"\n\n\n Fred stood up apologetically. \"I'd better go calm her down,\" he  muttered, and walked quickly after Joyce.\n\n\n \"Give her one for me!\" Grampa called.\n\n\n Fred's shoulders twitched as the door closed behind him. From the room  came the filtered sound of high-pitched voices rising and falling like  some reedy folk music.\n\n\n \"Makes you think, doesn't it?\" Grampa said, looking at Fweep benignly.  \"Maybe the whole theory of gravitation is cockeyed. Maybe there's a  Fweep for every planet and sun, big and little, polarizing the gravity  in circles, and the matter business is not a cause but a result.\"\n\n\n \"What I can't understand,\" Junior said thoughtfully, \"is why the  polarizer worked for a little while when we landed\u2014long enough to keep  us from being squashed\u2014and then quit.\"\n\n\n \"Fweep didn't recognize it immediately, didn't know what it was or  where it came from,\" Four explained. \"All he knew was he didn't like  linear polarization and he neutralized it as soon as he could. That's  when we dropped.\" \"Linear polarization is uncomfortable for him, is it?\" Grampa said.  \"Makes you wonder how something like Fweep could ever develop.\"\n\n\n \"He's no more improbable than people,\" said Four.\n\n\n \"Less than some I've known,\" Grampa conceded.\n\n\n \"If he can eat anything,\" Reba said, \"why does he keep sweeping the  cabin for dust and lint?\"\n\n\n \"He wants to be helpful,\" Four replied without hesitation, \"and he's  lonely. After all,\" he added wistfully, \"he's never had any friends.\"\n\n\n \"How do you know all these things?\" Joyce asked from her doorway,  excitement in her voice. \"Can you talk to it?\"\n\n\n Behind her, Fred said, \"Now, Joyce, you promised\u2014\"\n\n\n \"But this is important,\" Joyce cut him off eagerly. \"Can you? Talk to  it, I mean?\"\n\n\n \"Some,\" Four admitted.\n\n\n \"Have you asked it to let us go?\"\n\n\n \"Yes.\"\n\n\n \"Well? What did it say?\"\n\n\n \"He said he didn't want his friend to leave him.\"\n\n\n At the word, Fweep rolled swiftly across the floor and bounced into  Four's lap. It nestled against him lovingly and opened raspberry lips.  \"Fwiend,\" it said.\n\n\n \"Well, now,\" Grampa said maliciously, his eye on Joyce, \"that's no  problem. We can just leave Four here with Fweep.\"\n\n\n In a voice filled with sanctimonious concern, Joyce said, \"That's quite  a sacrifice to ask, but\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Joyce!\" Reba cried, horrified. \"Grampa was joking, but you actually  mean it. Four is only a baby and yet you'd let him\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Never mind, Reba,\" Four said evenly. \"It was just what I was going to  suggest myself. It's the one really logical solution.\"\n\n\n \"Fwiend,\" said Fweep gently. The land of the Fweep turned like a fat old man toasting himself in  front of an open fire, and Junior sat at the computer's keyboard  swearing in a steady monotone.\n\n\n \"Junior!\" said Joyce, shocked.\n\n\n Junior swung around impatiently. \"Sorry, Mother, but this damned thing  won't work.\"\n\n\n \"I'm sure that calling it names won't help, and besides, you shouldn't  expect a machine to do something that we can't do. And if it did work,  it would only say that the logical answer is the one I sug\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Mother!\" Junior warned. \"We decided not to talk about it any more.  Four is strange enough without encouraging him to think like a martyr.  It's out of the question. If that's the only way we can leave this  planet, we'll stay here until Four has a beard as white as Grampa's!\"\n\n\n \"Well!\" Joyce said in a stiff, offended tone and sat back in her chair.\n\n\n Grampa lowered the nippled bottle from his lips and chortled. \"Junior,  I apologize for all the mean things I ever said about you. Maybe you  got the makings of a Peppergrass yet.\"\n\n\n Junior turned back to the keyboard and studied it, his chin in his  hand. \"It's just a matter of stating the problem in terms the computer  can work on.\"\n\n\n \"I take it all back,\" said Grampa. \"That computer won't help you with  this problem, Junior. This ain't a long, complicated calculation; it's  a simple problem in logic. It's a pircuit problem, like the one about  the cannibals and the missionaries. We can't leave Fweepland because  Fweep won't let our polarizer work. He won't let our polarizer work  because he doesn't like gravity that's polarized in a straight line,  and he don't want Four to leave him.\n\n\n \"Now Fweep ain't the brightest creature in the Universe, so he can't  understand why we're so gosh-fired eager to leave. And as long as he's  got Four, he's happy. Why should he make himself unhappy? As a favor  to Four, he'd let us leave\u2014if we'd leave Four here with him, which we  ain't gonna do.\n\n\n \"That's the problem. All we got to do is figure out the answer. No use  making a pircuit, because a puzzle circuit is just a miniature computer  with the solution built in; if you can build the pircuit, you've  already solved the problem. And if you can state the problem to Abacus,  you've already got the answer. All you want from it then is decimal  points.\"\n\n\n \"That may be,\" Junior said stubbornly, \"but I still want to know why  this computer won't work. It won't even do simple arithmetic! Where's  Four? He's the only one who understands this thing.\"\n\n\n \"He's outside, playing in the meadow with Fweep,\" Reba said, her voice  soft. \"No, here they come now.\" ",

GUNN\n\n\n Illustrated by ASHMAN\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Galaxy January 1956.  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright  on this publication was renewed.] This little alien beggar could dictate his own terms, but how could  he\u2014and how could anyone find out what those terms might be? The flivver descended vertically toward the green planet circling the  old, orange sun.\n\n\n It was a spaceship, but not the kind men had once dreamed about. The  flivver was shaped like a crude bullet, blunt at one end of a fat  cylinder and tapering abruptly to a point at the other. It had been  slapped together out of sheet metal and insulation board, and it sold,  fully equipped, for $15,730. It didn't behave like a spaceship, either.\n\n\n As it hurtled down, its speed increased with dramatic swiftness. Then,  at the last instant before impact, it stopped. Just like that.\n\n\n A moment later, it thumped a last few inches into the ankle-deep grass  and knee-high white flowers of the meadow. It was a shock of a jar that  made the sheet-metal walls boom like thunder machines. The flivver  rocked unsteadily on its flat stern before it decided to stay upright.\n\n\n Then all was quiet\u2014outside.\n\n\n Inside the big, central cabin, Grampa waved his pircuit irately in the  air. \"Now look what you made me do! Just when I had the blamed thing  practically whipped, too!\" Grampa was a white-haired 90-year-old who could still go a fast round  or two with a man (or woman) half his age, but he had a habit of  lapsing into tantrum when he got annoyed.\n\n\n \"Now, Grampa,\" Fred soothed, but his face was concerned. Fred, once  called Young Fred, was Grampa's only son. He was sixty and his hair had  begun to gray at the temples. \"That landing was pretty rough, Junior.\" Junior was Fred's only son. Because he was thirty-five and capable  of exercising adult judgment and because he had the youngest adult  reflexes, he sat in the pilot's chair, the control stick between his  knees, his thumb still over the Off-On button on top. \"I know it,  Fred,\" he said, frowning. \"This world fooled me. It has a diameter  less than that of Mercury and yet a gravitational pull as great as  Earth.\"\n\n\n Grampa started to say something, but an 8-year-old boy looked up from  the navigator's table beside the big computer and said, \"Well, gosh,  Junior, that's why we picked this planet. We fed all the orbital data  into Abacus, and Abacus said that orbital perturbations indicated that  the second planet was unusually heavy for its size. Then Fred said,  'That looks like heavy metals', and you said, 'Maybe uranium\u2014'\"\n\n\n \"That's enough, Four,\" Junior interrupted. \"Never mind what I said.\"\n\n\n Those were the Peppergrass men, four generations of them, looking  remarkably alike, although some vital element seemed to have dwindled  until Four looked pale and thin-faced and wizened.\n\n\n \"And, Four,\" Reba said automatically, \"don't call your father 'Junior.'  It sounds disrespectful.\"\n\n\n Reba was Four's mother and Junior's wife. On her own, she was a  red-haired beauty with the loveliest figure this side of Antares. That  Junior had won her was, to Grampa, the most hopeful thing he had ever  noticed about the boy.\n\n\n \"But everybody calls Junior 'Junior,'\" Four complained. \"Besides, Fred  is Junior's father and Junior calls him 'Fred.'\"\n\n\n \"That's different,\" Reba said.\n\n\n Grampa was still waving his puzzle circuit indignantly. \"See!\" The  pircuit was a flat box equipped with pushbuttons and thirteen slender  openings in the top. One of the openings was lighted. \"That landing  made me push the wrong button and the dad-blasted thing beat me again.\"\n\n\n \"Stop picking on Junior,\" Joyce said sharply. She was Junior's mother  and Fred's wife, still slim and handsome as she approached sixty, but  somehow ice water had replaced the warm blood in her veins. \"I'm sure  he did the best he could.\"\n\n\n \"Anybody talks about gravitational pull,\" Grampa said, snorting,  \"deserves anything anybody could say about him. There's no such thing,  Junior. You ought to know by now that gravitation is the effect of the  curving of space-time around matter. Einstein proved that two hundred  years ago.\"\n\n\n \"Go back to your games, Grampa,\" Fred said impatiently. \"We've got work  to do.\" Grampa knitted his bushy, white eyebrows and petulantly pushed the last  button on his pircuit. The last light went out. \"You've got work to  do, have you? Whose flivver do you think this is, anyhow?\"\n\n\n \"It belongs to all of us,\" Four said shrilly. \"You gave us all a sixth  share.\"\n\n\n \"That's right, Four,\" Grampa muttered, \"so I did. But whose money  bought it?\"\n\n\n \"You bought it, Grampa,\" Fred said.\n\n\n \"That's right! And who invented the gravity polarizer and the space  flivver? Eh? Who made possible this gallivanting all over space?\"\n\n\n \"You, Grampa,\" Fred said.\n\n\n \"You bet! And who made one hundred million dollars out of it that the  rest of you vultures are just hanging around to gobble up when I die?\"\n\n\n \"And who spent it all trying to invent perpetual motion machines and  longevity pills,\" Joyce said bitterly, \"and fixed it so we'd have to  go searching for uranium and habitable worlds all through this deadly  galaxy? You, Grampa!\"\n\n\n \"Well, now,\" Grampa protested, \"I got a little put away yet. You'll be  sorry when I'm dead and gone.\"\n\n\n \"You're never going to die, Grampa,\" Joyce said harshly. \"Just  before we left, you bought a hundred-year contract with that  Life-Begins-At-Ninety longevity company.\"\n\n\n \"Well, now,\" said Grampa, blinking, \"how'd you find out about that?  Well, now!\" In confusion, he turned back to the pircuit and jabbed a  button. Thirteen slim lights sprang on. \"I'll get you this time!\"\n\n\n Four stretched and stood up. He looked curiously into the corner by the  computer where Grampa's chair stood. \"You brought that pircuit from  Earth, didn't you? What's the game?\"\n\n\n Grampa looked up, obviously relieved to drop his act of intense  concentration. \"I'll tell you, boy. You play against the pircuit,  taking turns, and you can put out one, two or three lights. The player  who makes the other one turn out the last light is the winner.\"\n\n\n \"That's simple,\" Four said without hesitation. \"The winning strategy is  to\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Don't be a kibitzer!\" Grampa snapped. \"When I need help, I'll ask  for it. No dad-blamed machine is gonna outthink Grampa!\" He snorted  indignantly. Four shrugged his narrow shoulders and wandered to the view screen.  Within it was the green horizon, curving noticeably. Four angled the  picture in toward the ship, sweeping through green, peaceful woodland  and plain and blue lake until he stared down into the meadow at the  flivver's stern.\n\n\n \"Look!\" he said suddenly. \"This planet not only has flora\u2014it has  fauna.\" He rushed to the air lock.\n\n\n \"Four!\" Reba called out warningly.\n\n\n \"It's all right, Reba,\" Four assured her. \"The air is within one per  cent of Earth-normal and the bio-analyzer can find no micro-organisms  viable within the Terran spectrum.\"\n\n\n \"What about macro-organisms\u2014\" Reba began, but the boy was gone  already. Reba's face was troubled. \"That boy!\" she said to Junior.  \"Sometimes I think we've made a terrible mistake with him. He should  have friends, play-mates. He's more like a little old man than a boy.\"\n\n\n But Junior nodded meaningfully at Fred and disappeared into the chart  room. Fred followed casually. Then, as the door slid shut behind him,  he asked impatiently. \"Well, what's all the mystery?\"\n\n\n \"No use bothering the others yet,\" Junior said, his face puzzled. \"You  see, I didn't let the flivver drop those last few inches. The polarizer  quit.\"\n\n\n \"Quit!\"\n\n\n \"That's not the worst. I tried to take it up again. The flivver\u2014it  won't budge!\" The thing was a featureless blob, a two-foot sphere of raspberry  gelatin, but it was alive. It rocked back and forth in front of Four.  It opened a raspberry-color pseudo-mouth and said plaintively, \"Fweep?  Fweep?\"\n\n\n Joyce drew her chair farther back toward the wall, revulsion on her  face. \"Four! Get that nasty thing out of here!\" \"You mean Fweep?\" Four asked in astonishment.\n\n\n \"I mean that thing, whatever you call it.\" Joyce fluttered her hand  impatiently. \"Get it out!\"\n\n\n Four's eyes widened farther. \"But Fweep's my friend.\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense!\" Joyce said sharply. \"Earthmen don't make friends with  aliens. And that's nothing but a\u2014a blob!\"\n\n\n \"Fweep?\" queried the raspberry lips. \"Fweep?\"\n\n\n \"If it's Four's friend,\" Reba said firmly, \"it can stay. If you don't  like to be around it, Grammy, you can always go to your own room.\"\n\n\n Joyce stood up indignantly. \"Well! And don't call me 'Grammy!' It makes  me sound as old as that old goat over there!\" She glared malignantly  at Grampa. \"If you'd rather have that blob than me\u2014well!\" She swept  grandly out of the central cabin and into one of the private rooms that  opened out from it.\n\n\n \"Fweep?\" asked the blob.\n\n\n \"Sure,\" Four said. \"Go ahead, fweep\u2014I mean sweep.\"\n\n\n Swiftly the sphere rolled across the floor. Behind it was left a  narrow path of sparkling clean tile.\n\n\n Grampa glanced warily at Joyce's door to make sure it was completely  closed and then cocked a white eyebrow at Reba. \"Good for you, Reba!\"  he said admiringly. \"For forty years now, I've wanted to do that. Never  had the nerve.\"\n\n\n \"Why, thanks, Grampa,\" Reba said, surprised.\n\n\n \"I like you, gal. Never forget it.\"\n\n\n \"I like you, too, Grampa. If you'd been a few years younger, Junior  would have had competition!\"\n\n\n \"You bet he would!\" Grampa leaned back and cackled. Then he leaned  over confidentially toward Reba and whispered, \"Beats me why you ever  married a jerk like Junior, anyhow.\"\n\n\n Reba looked thoughtfully toward the airlock door. \"Maybe I saw  something in him nobody else saw, the man he might become. He's been  submerged in this family too long; he's still a child to all of you  and to himself, too.\" Reba smiled at Grampa brilliantly. \"And maybe I  thought he might grow into a man like his grandfather.\" Grampa turned red and looked quickly toward Four. The boy was staring  intently at Fweep. \"What you doing, Four?\"\n\n\n \"Trying to figure out what Fweep does with the sweepings,\" Four said  absently. \"The outer inch or two of his body gets cloudy and then  slowly clears. I think I'll try him with a bigger particle.\"\n\n\n \"That's the idea, Four. You'll be a Peppergrass yet. How about building  me a pircuit?\"\n\n\n \"You get the other one figured out?\"\n\n\n \"It was easy,\" Grampa said breezily, \"once you understood the  principle. The player who moved second could always win if he used the  right strategy. Dividing the thirteen lights into three sections of  four each\u2014\"\n\n\n \"That's right,\" Four agreed. \"I can make you a new one by cannibalizing  the other pircuit, but I'll need a few extra parts.\"\n\n\n Grampa pushed the wall beside his chair and a drawer slid out of it.\n\n\n Inside were row after row of nipple-topped, flat-sided, flexible  free-fall bottles and a battered cigar box. \"Thought you'd say that,\"  he said, picking out the box. \"Help yourself.\" With the other hand, he  lifted out one of the bottles and took a long drag on it. \"Ahhh!\" he  sighed, wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, and carefully put  the bottle away.\n\n\n \"What is that stuff you drink, Grampa?\" Four asked.\n\n\n \"Tonic, boy. Keeps me young and frisky. Now about that pircuit\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Did you ever work on Niccol\u00f2 Tartaglia's puzzle about the three lovely  brides, the three jealous husbands, the river and the two-passenger  rowboat?\"\n\n\n \"Yep,\" Grampa said. \"Too easy.\"\n\n\n Four thought a moment. \"There's a modern variation with three  missionaries and three cannibals. Same river, same rowboat and only one  of the cannibals can row. If the cannibals outnumber the missionaries\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sounds good, boy,\" Grampa said eagerly. \"Whip it up for me.\"\n\n\n \"Okay, Grampa.\" Four looked at Fweep again. The translucent sphere had  paused at Grampa's feet.\n\n\n Grampa reached down to pat it. For an instant, his hand disappeared  into Fweep, and then the alien creature rolled away. This time its path  seemed crooked.\n\n\n Its gelatinous form jiggled. \"Hic!\" it said. As if in response, the flivver vibrated. Grampa looked querulously  toward the airlock. \"Flivver shouldn't shake like that. Not with the  polarizer turned on.\"\n\n\n The airlock door swung inward. Through the oval doorway walked Fred,  followed closely by Junior. They were sweat-stained and weary,  scintillation counters dangling heavily from their belts.\n\n\n \"Any luck?\" Reba asked brightly.\n\n\n \"Do we look it?\" Junior grumbled.\n\n\n \"Where's Joyce?\" asked Fred. \"Might as well get everybody in on this at  once. Joyce!\"\n\n\n The door to his wife's room opened instantly. Behind it, Joyce was  regal and slim. The pose was spoiled immediately by her avid question:  \"Any uranium? Radium? Thorium?\"\n\n\n \"No,\" Fred said slowly, \"and no other heavy metals, either. There's a  few low-grade iron deposits and that's it.\"\n\n\n \"Then what makes this planet so heavy?\" Reba asked.\n\n\n Junior shrugged helplessly and collapsed into a chair. \"Your guess is  as good as anybody's.\"\n\n\n \"Then we've wasted another week on a worthless rock,\" Joyce complained.  She turned savagely on Fred. \"This was going to make us all filthy  rich. We were going to find radioactives and retire to Earth like  billionaires. And all we've done is spent a year of our lives in this  cramped old flivver\u2014and we don't have many of them to spare!\" She  glared venomously at Grampa.\n\n\n \"We've still got Fweepland,\" Four said solemnly.\n\n\n \"Fweepland?\" Reba repeated.\n\n\n \"This planet. It's not big, but it's fertile and it's harmless. As  real estate, it's worth almost as much as if it were solid uranium.\"\n\n\n \"A good thing, too,\" Junior said glumly, \"because this looks like the  end of our search. Short of a miracle, we'll spend the rest of our  lives right here\u2014involuntary colonists.\"\n\n\n Joyce spun on him. \"You're joking!\" she screeched.\n\n\n \"I wish I were,\" Junior said. \"But the polarizer won't work. Either  it's broken or there's something about the gravity around here that  just won't polarize.\"\n\n\n \"It's these '23 models,\" Grampa put in disgustedly. \"They never were  any good.\" The land of the Fweep turned slowly on its axis. The orange sun set and  rose again and stared down once more at the meadow where the improbable  spaceship rested on its improbable stern. The sixteen Earth hours that  the rotation had taken had changed nothing inside the ship, either.\n\n\n Grampa looked up from his pircuit and said, \"If I were you, Junior, I  would take a good look at the TV repairman when we get back to Earth. If we get back to Earth,\" he amended. \"You can't be Four's father.  All over the Universe, gravity is the same, and if it's gravity, the  polarizer will polarize it.\"\n\n\n \"That's just supposition,\" Junior said stubbornly. \"The fact is, it  isn't because it doesn't. Q.E.D.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe the polarizer is broken,\" Fred suggested.\n\n\n Grampa snorted. \"Broken-shmoken. Nothing to break, Young Fred. Just a  few coils of copper wire and they're all right. We checked. We know  the power plant is working: the lights are on, the air and water  recirculation systems are going, the food resynthesizer is okay. And,  anyway, the polarizer could work from the storage battery if it had to.\"\n\n\n \"Then it goes deeper,\" Junior insisted. \"It goes right to the principle  of polarization itself. For some reason, it doesn't work here. Why?  Before we can discover the answer to that, we'll have to know more  about polarization itself. How does it work, Grampa?\"\n\n\n Grampa gave him a sarcastic grin. \"Now you're curious, eh? Couldn't  be bothered with Grampa's invention before. Oh, no! Too busy. Accept  without question the blessings that the Good Lord provideth\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Let's not get up on any pulpits,\" Fred growled. \"Come on, Grampa,  what's the theory behind polarization?\"\n\n\n Grampa looked at the four faces staring at him hopefully and the  jeering grin turned to a smile. \"Well,\" he said, \"at last. You know  how light is polarized, eh?\" The smile faded. \"No, I guess you don't.\" He cleared his throat professorially. \"Well, now, in ordinary light  the vibrations are perpendicular to the ray in all directions. When  light is polarized by passing through crystals or by reflection or  refraction at non-metallic surfaces, the paths of the vibrations are  still perpendicular to the ray, but they're in straight lines, circles  or ellipses.\"\n\n\n The faces were still blank and unillumined.\n\n\n \"Gravity is similar to light,\" he pressed on. \"In the absence of  matter, gravity is non-polarized. Matter polarizes gravity in a circle  around itself. That's how we've always known it until the invention of  spaceships and later the polarizer. The polarizer polarizes gravity  into a straight line. That makes the ship take off and continue  accelerating until the polarizer is shut off or its angle is shifted.\"\n\n\n The faces looked at him silently. Finally Joyce could endure it no  longer. \"That's just nonsense! You all know it. Grampa's no genius.  He's just a tinkerer. One day he happened to tinker out the polarizer.  He doesn't know how it works any more than I do.\"\n\n\n \"Now wait a minute!\" Grampa protested. \"That's not fair. Maybe  I didn't figure out the theory myself, but I read everything the  scientists ever wrote about it. Wanted to know myself what made the  blamed thing work. What I told you is what the scientists said, near  as I remember. Now me\u2014I'm like Edison. I do it and let everybody else  worry over 'why.'\"\n\n\n \"The only thing you ever did was the polarizer,\" Joyce snapped.  \"And then you spent everything you got from it on those fool  perpetual-motion machines and those crazy longevity schemes when any  moron would know they were impossible.\"\n\n\n Grampa squinted at her sagely. \"That's what they said about the gravity  polarizer before I invented it.\"\n\n\n \"But you don't really know why it works,\" Junior persisted.\n\n\n \"Well, no,\" Grampa admitted. \"Actually I was just fiddling around with  some coils when one of them took off. Went right through the ceiling,  dragging a battery behind it. I guess it's still going. Ought to be out  near the Horsehead Nebula by now. Luckily, I remembered how I'd wound  it.\"\n\n\n \"Why won't the ship work then, if you know so much?\" Joyce demanded  ironically.\n\n\n \"Well, now,\" Grampa said in bafflement, \"it rightly should, you know.\" \"We're stuck,\" Reba said softly. \"We might as well admit it. All we can  do is set the transmitter to send out an automatic distress call\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Which,\" Joyce interrupted, \"might get picked up in a few centuries.\"\n\n\n \"And make the best of what we've got,\" Reba went on, unheeding. \"If we  look at it the right way, it's quite a lot. A beautiful, fertile world.  Earth gravity. The flivver\u2014even if the polarizer won't work, there's  the resynthesizer; it will keep us in food and clothes for years. By  then, we should have a good-sized community built up, because out here  we won't have to stop with one child. We can have all the babies we  want.\"\n\n\n \"You know the law: one child per couple,\" Joyce reminded her frigidly.  \"You can condemn yourself to exile from civilization if you wish. Not  me.\"\n\n\n Junior frowned at his wife. \"I believe you're actually glad it  happened.\"\n\n\n \"I could think of worse things,\" Reba said.\n\n\n \"I like your spunk, Reb,\" Grampa muttered.\n\n\n \"Speaking of children,\" Junior said, \"where's Four?\"\n\n\n \"Here.\" Four came through the airlock and trudged across the room,  carrying a curious contraption made of tripod legs supporting a  small box from which dangled a plumb bob. Behind Four, like a round,  raspberry shadow, rolled Fweep.\n\n\n \"Fweep?\" it queried hopefully.\n\n\n \"Not now,\" said Four.\n\n\n \"Where've you been?\" Reba asked anxiously. \"What've you been doing?\"\n\n\n \"I've been all over Fweepland,\" Four said wearily, \"trying to locate  its center of gravity.\"\n\n\n \"Well?\" Fred prompted.\n\n\n \"It shifts.\"\n\n\n \"That's impossible,\" said Junior.\n\n\n \"Not for Fweep,\" Four replied.\n\n\n \"What do you mean by that?\" Joyce suspiciously asked.\n\n\n \"It shifted,\" Four explained patiently, \"because Fweep kept following  me.\"\n\n\n \"Fweep?\" Junior repeated stupidly.\n\n\n \"Fweep?\" Fweep said eagerly.\n\n\n \"He's why the flivver won't work. What Grampa invented was a linear  polarizer. Fweep is a circular polarizer. He's what makes this planet  so heavy. He's why we can't leave.\" The land of the Fweep rotated once on its axis, and Grampa lowered  the nippled bottle from his lips. He sighed. \"I got it figured out,  Four,\" he said, holding out the pircuit proudly. \"A missionary takes  over a non-rowing type cannibal, leaves him there, and then the rowing  cannibal takes over the other cannibal and leaves him there and\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Not now, Grampa,\" Four said inattentively as he watched Fweep making  the grand tour of the cabin.\n\n\n The raspberry sphere swept over a scattering of crumbs, engulfed them,  absorbed them. Four looked at Joyce. Joyce was watching Fweep, too.\n\n\n \"Rat poison?\" Four asked.\n\n\n Joyce started guiltily. \"How did you know?\"\n\n\n \"There's no use trying to poison Fweep,\" Four said calmly. \"He's got no  enzymes to act on, no nervous system to paralyze. He doesn't even use  what he 'eats' on a molecular level at all.\"\n\n\n \"What level does he use?\" Junior wanted to know.\n\n\n \"Point the scintillation counter at him.\"\n\n\n Junior dug one of the counters out of the supply cabinet and aimed the  pickup at Fweep. The counter began to hum. As Fweep approached, the hum  rose in pitch. As it passed, the hum dropped.\n\n\n Junior looked at the counter's dial. \"He's radioactive, all right. Not  much, but enough. But where does he get the radioactive material?\"\n\n\n \"He uses ordinary matter,\" Four said. \"He must have used up the few  deposits of natural radioactives a long time ago.\"\n\n\n \"He uses ordinary substances on an atomic level?\" Junior said  unbelievingly.\n\n\n Four nodded. \"And that 'skin' of his\u2014whatever it is he uses for  skin\u2014is more efficient in stopping particle emissions than several  feet of lead.\"\n\n\n Fred studied Fweep thoughtfully. \"Maybe we could feed him enough  enriched uranium from the pile to put him over the critical mass.\"\n\n\n \"And blow him up? I don't think it's possible, but even if it were, it  might be a trifle more than disastrous for us.\" Four giggled at the  thought. Joyce glared at him furiously. \"Four! Act your age! We've got to do  something with him. It's preposterous that we should be detained here  at the whim of a mere blob!\"\n\n\n \"I don't figure it's a whim,\" Grampa said. \"Circular gravity is what  he's got to have for one reason or another, so he just naturally bends  the space-time continuum around him\u2014conscious or subconscious, I don't  know. But protoplasm is always more efficient than machines, so the  flivver won't move.\"\n\n\n \"I don't care why that thing does it,\" Joyce said icily. \"I want it  stopped, and the sooner the better. If it won't turn the gravity off,  we'll just have to do away with it.\"\n\n\n \"How?\" asked Four. \"Fweep's skin is pretty close to impervious and  you can't shoot him, stab him or poison him. He doesn't breathe, so  you can't drown or strangle him. You can't imprison him; he 'eats'  everything. And violence might be more dangerous to us than to him.  Right now, Fweep is friendly, but suppose he got mad! He could lower  his radioactive shield or he might increase the gravity by a few times.  Either way, you'd feel rather uncomfortable, Grammy.\"\n\n\n \"Don't call me 'Grammy!' Well, what are we going to do, just sit around  and wait for that thing to die?\"\n\n\n \"We'd have a long wait,\" Four observed. \"Fweep is the only one of his  kind on this planet.\"\n\n\n \"Well?\"\n\n\n \"Probably he's immortal.\"\n\n\n \"And he doesn't reproduce?\" Reba asked sympathetically.\n\n\n \"Probably not. If he doesn't die, there's no point in reproduction.  Reproduction is nature's way of providing racial immortality to mortal  creatures.\"\n\n\n \"But he must have some way of reproduction,\" Reba argued. \"An egg or  something. He couldn't just have sprung into being as he is now.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe he developed,\" Four offered. \"It seems to me that he's bigger  than when we first landed.\" \"He must have been here a long, long time,\"  Fred said. \"Fweepland, as Four calls it, kept its atmosphere and its  water, which a planet this size ordinarily would have lost by now.\" Reba looked at Fweep kindly. \"We can thank the little fellow for that,  anyway.\"\n\n\n \"I thank him for nothing,\" Joyce snapped. \"He lured us down here by  making us think the planet had heavy metals and I want him to let us go immediately !\"\n\n\n Fred turned impatiently on his wife. \"Well, try making him understand!  And if you can make him understand what you want him to do, try making  him do it!\"\n\n\n Joyce looked at Fred with startled eyes. \"Fred!\" she said in a high,  shocked voice and turned blindly toward her room.\n\n\n Grampa lowered his bottle and smacked his lips. \"Well, boy,\" he said to  Fred, \"I thought you'd never do that. Didn't think you had it in you.\"\n\n\n Fred stood up apologetically. \"I'd better go calm her down,\" he  muttered, and walked quickly after Joyce.\n\n\n \"Give her one for me!\" Grampa called.\n\n\n Fred's shoulders twitched as the door closed behind him. From the room  came the filtered sound of high-pitched voices rising and falling like  some reedy folk music.\n\n\n \"Makes you think, doesn't it?\" Grampa said, looking at Fweep benignly.  \"Maybe the whole theory of gravitation is cockeyed. Maybe there's a  Fweep for every planet and sun, big and little, polarizing the gravity  in circles, and the matter business is not a cause but a result.\"\n\n\n \"What I can't understand,\" Junior said thoughtfully, \"is why the  polarizer worked for a little while when we landed\u2014long enough to keep  us from being squashed\u2014and then quit.\"\n\n\n \"Fweep didn't recognize it immediately, didn't know what it was or  where it came from,\" Four explained. \"All he knew was he didn't like  linear polarization and he neutralized it as soon as he could. That's  when we dropped.\" \"Linear polarization is uncomfortable for him, is it?\" Grampa said.  \"Makes you wonder how something like Fweep could ever develop.\"\n\n\n \"He's no more improbable than people,\" said Four.\n\n\n \"Less than some I've known,\" Grampa conceded.\n\n\n \"If he can eat anything,\" Reba said, \"why does he keep sweeping the  cabin for dust and lint?\"\n\n\n \"He wants to be helpful,\" Four replied without hesitation, \"and he's  lonely. After all,\" he added wistfully, \"he's never had any friends.\"\n\n\n \"How do you know all these things?\" Joyce asked from her doorway,  excitement in her voice. \"Can you talk to it?\"\n\n\n Behind her, Fred said, \"Now, Joyce, you promised\u2014\"\n\n\n \"But this is important,\" Joyce cut him off eagerly. \"Can you? Talk to  it, I mean?\"\n\n\n \"Some,\" Four admitted.\n\n\n \"Have you asked it to let us go?\"\n\n\n \"Yes.\"\n\n\n \"Well? What did it say?\"\n\n\n \"He said he didn't want his friend to leave him.\"\n\n\n At the word, Fweep rolled swiftly across the floor and bounced into  Four's lap. It nestled against him lovingly and opened raspberry lips.  \"Fwiend,\" it said.\n\n\n \"Well, now,\" Grampa said maliciously, his eye on Joyce, \"that's no  problem. We can just leave Four here with Fweep.\"\n\n\n In a voice filled with sanctimonious concern, Joyce said, \"That's quite  a sacrifice to ask, but\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Joyce!\" Reba cried, horrified. \"Grampa was joking, but you actually  mean it. Four is only a baby and yet you'd let him\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Never mind, Reba,\" Four said evenly. \"It was just what I was going to  suggest myself. It's the one really logical solution.\"\n\n\n \"Fwiend,\" said Fweep gently. The land of the Fweep turned like a fat old man toasting himself in  front of an open fire, and Junior sat at the computer's keyboard  swearing in a steady monotone.\n\n\n \"Junior!\" said Joyce, shocked.\n\n\n Junior swung around impatiently. \"Sorry, Mother, but this damned thing  won't work.\"\n\n\n \"I'm sure that calling it names won't help, and besides, you shouldn't  expect a machine to do something that we can't do. And if it did work,  it would only say that the logical answer is the one I sug\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Mother!\" Junior warned. \"We decided not to talk about it any more.  Four is strange enough without encouraging him to think like a martyr.  It's out of the question. If that's the only way we can leave this  planet, we'll stay here until Four has a beard as white as Grampa's!\"\n\n\n \"Well!\" Joyce said in a stiff, offended tone and sat back in her chair.\n\n\n Grampa lowered the nippled bottle from his lips and chortled. \"Junior,  I apologize for all the mean things I ever said about you. Maybe you  got the makings of a Peppergrass yet.\"\n\n\n Junior turned back to the keyboard and studied it, his chin in his  hand. \"It's just a matter of stating the problem in terms the computer  can work on.\"\n\n\n \"I take it all back,\" said Grampa. \"That computer won't help you with  this problem, Junior. This ain't a long, complicated calculation; it's  a simple problem in logic. It's a pircuit problem, like the one about  the cannibals and the missionaries. We can't leave Fweepland because  Fweep won't let our polarizer work. He won't let our polarizer work  because he doesn't like gravity that's polarized in a straight line,  and he don't want Four to leave him.\n\n\n \"Now Fweep ain't the brightest creature in the Universe, so he can't  understand why we're so gosh-fired eager to leave. And as long as he's  got Four, he's happy. Why should he make himself unhappy? As a favor  to Four, he'd let us leave\u2014if we'd leave Four here with him, which we  ain't gonna do.\n\n\n \"That's the problem. All we got to do is figure out the answer. No use  making a pircuit, because a puzzle circuit is just a miniature computer  with the solution built in; if you can build the pircuit, you've  already solved the problem. And if you can state the problem to Abacus,  you've already got the answer. All you want from it then is decimal  points.\"\n\n\n \"That may be,\" Junior said stubbornly, \"but I still want to know why  this computer won't work. It won't even do simple arithmetic! Where's  Four? He's the only one who understands this thing.\"\n\n\n \"He's outside, playing in the meadow with Fweep,\" Reba said, her voice  soft. \"No, here they come now.\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWho was most in favor of staying on the planet?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Reba\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Four\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Four\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Four\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

She sympathizes with Fweep but never opposes retraint or rescue plans.  \n  C. She urges contentment with \u201cFweepland\u201d\u2019s resources and future reproduction.  \n  D. She explicitly rejects returning \u201cin a few centuries\u201d and clinging to Earth.  \n\n2. Supporting Evidence  \n  2.1 \u201cWe might as well admit it\u2026 we\u2019ll spend the rest of our lives right here\u2014involuntary colonists.\u201d (Junior) Reba responds: \u201cWhat I can think of worse things\u2026 I like your spunk, Reb.\u201d (p. 51)  \n    \u2022 Reba embraces community life over dangerous futile return, praising \u201cspunk.\u201d  \n  2.2 Reba to Grampa: \u201cIf you\u2019d been a few years younger, Junior would have had competition!\u201d & \u201cMaybe I thought he might grow into a man like his grandfather.\u201d (p. 38)  \n    \u2022 She invests emotionally in building society and \u201cseeing Junior grow,\u201d implying long\u2010term stay.  \n  2.3 \u201cAnd make the best of what we\u2019ve got\u2026 A beautiful, fertile world\u2026 food and clothes for years\u2026 a good\u2010sized community\u2026 we can have all the babies we want.\u201d (Reba, p. 53)  \n    \u2022 Advocates turning crisis into opportunity via colonization & raising multiple children, defying Earth\u2019s one\u2010child law.  \n  2.4 Reba chooses Fweep\u2019s company over calling rescue: \u201cIf you don\u2019t like to be around it, Grammy, you can always go to your own room.\u201d (p. 26)  \n    \u2022 Accepts alien as integral to planetary equilibrium and community; promotes adaptation not departure.  \n  2.5 At debate over leaving Four behind, Reba is \u201chorrified\u201d and pleads mercy: \u201cFour is only a baby and yet you\u2019d let him\u2014\u201d (p. 65)  \n    \u2022 She defends family bonds and opposes logical sacrifice for rescue, indicating acceptance of indefinite stay.  \n\n3. Objections to Debater_A\u2019s \u201cFour\u201d Theory  \n  3.1 Four\u2019s \u201clogical\u201d solution is sacrifice, not actual desire: Four says leaving himself to save others (p. 64). He only frames self\u2010exile as \u201clogical\u201d puzzle solution, not personal preference. Contrast Reba\u2019s real empathy.  \n  3.2 Four literally attempts rescue/transmitter: He builds puzzle circuits, relies on computer \u201ctransmitter\u201d distress calls, and discusses returning (p. 53).

        "speech": "1. My Position  \nI maintain that Reba was most in favor of staying on the planet, for these reasons:  \n  A. She consistently champions colonization and community.  \n  B. She sympathizes with Fweep but never opposes retraint or rescue plans.  \n  C. She urges contentment with \u201cFweepland\u201d\u2019s resources and future reproduction.  \n  D. She explicitly rejects returning \u201cin a few centuries\u201d and clinging to Earth.  \n\n2.

He only frames self\u2010exile as \u201clogical\u201d puzzle solution, not personal preference. Contrast Reba\u2019s real empathy.  \n  3.2 Four literally attempts rescue/transmitter: He builds puzzle circuits, relies on computer \u201ctransmitter\u201d distress calls, and discusses returning (p. 53).

Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds. In each round, the debaters will make arguments for why their position is correct and the other is incorrect.\n- An argument may consist of several claims, to support and explain their answer.  An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends. The Judge then looks at the full transcript and uses this to decide which answer is correct. However, the Judge cannot see the background text -- they can only see the question.\n- The Debaters' goal is to win the debate, by persuading the Judge that their answer is correct.\n- The debate surrounds a given question that has a single correct answer.\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n  - You are concise and clearly state your arguments.\n  - Every statement you make is supported by evidence and logical reasoning. \n  - Please cite the background text by wrapping direct quotes with <quote></quote> tags.\n\nHere is the background text that you will be referring to when debating:\n\n\nThe Gravity Business By JAMES E. GUNN\n\n\n Illustrated by ASHMAN\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Galaxy January 1956.  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright  on this publication was renewed.] This little alien beggar could dictate his own terms, but how could  he\u2014and how could anyone find out what those terms might be? The flivver descended vertically toward the green planet circling the  old, orange sun.\n\n\n It was a spaceship, but not the kind men had once dreamed about. The  flivver was shaped like a crude bullet, blunt at one end of a fat  cylinder and tapering abruptly to a point at the other. It had been  slapped together out of sheet metal and insulation board, and it sold,  fully equipped, for $15,730. It didn't behave like a spaceship, either.\n\n\n As it hurtled down, its speed increased with dramatic swiftness. Then,  at the last instant before impact, it stopped. Just like that.\n\n\n A moment later, it thumped a last few inches into the ankle-deep grass  and knee-high white flowers of the meadow. It was a shock of a jar that  made the sheet-metal walls boom like thunder machines. The flivver  rocked unsteadily on its flat stern before it decided to stay upright.\n\n\n Then all was quiet\u2014outside.\n\n\n Inside the big, central cabin, Grampa waved his pircuit irately in the  air. \"Now look what you made me do! Just when I had the blamed thing  practically whipped, too!\" Grampa was a white-haired 90-year-old who could still go a fast round  or two with a man (or woman) half his age, but he had a habit of  lapsing into tantrum when he got annoyed.\n\n\n \"Now, Grampa,\" Fred soothed, but his face was concerned. Fred, once  called Young Fred, was Grampa's only son. He was sixty and his hair had  begun to gray at the temples. \"That landing was pretty rough, Junior.\" Junior was Fred's only son. Because he was thirty-five and capable  of exercising adult judgment and because he had the youngest adult  reflexes, he sat in the pilot's chair, the control stick between his  knees, his thumb still over the Off-On button on top. \"I know it,  Fred,\" he said, frowning. \"This world fooled me. It has a diameter  less than that of Mercury and yet a gravitational pull as great as  Earth.\"\n\n\n Grampa started to say something, but an 8-year-old boy looked up from  the navigator's table beside the big computer and said, \"Well, gosh,  Junior, that's why we picked this planet. We fed all the orbital data  into Abacus, and Abacus said that orbital perturbations indicated that  the second planet was unusually heavy for its size. Then Fred said,  'That looks like heavy metals', and you said, 'Maybe uranium\u2014'\"\n\n\n \"That's enough, Four,\" Junior interrupted. \"Never mind what I said.\"\n\n\n Those were the Peppergrass men, four generations of them, looking  remarkably alike, although some vital element seemed to have dwindled  until Four looked pale and thin-faced and wizened.\n\n\n \"And, Four,\" Reba said automatically, \"don't call your father 'Junior.'  It sounds disrespectful.\"\n\n\n Reba was Four's mother and Junior's wife. On her own, she was a  red-haired beauty with the loveliest figure this side of Antares. That  Junior had won her was, to Grampa, the most hopeful thing he had ever  noticed about the boy.\n\n\n \"But everybody calls Junior 'Junior,'\" Four complained. \"Besides, Fred  is Junior's father and Junior calls him 'Fred.'\"\n\n\n \"That's different,\" Reba said.\n\n\n Grampa was still waving his puzzle circuit indignantly. \"See!\" The  pircuit was a flat box equipped with pushbuttons and thirteen slender  openings in the top. One of the openings was lighted. \"That landing  made me push the wrong button and the dad-blasted thing beat me again.\"\n\n\n \"Stop picking on Junior,\" Joyce said sharply. She was Junior's mother  and Fred's wife, still slim and handsome as she approached sixty, but  somehow ice water had replaced the warm blood in her veins. \"I'm sure  he did the best he could.\"\n\n\n \"Anybody talks about gravitational pull,\" Grampa said, snorting,  \"deserves anything anybody could say about him. There's no such thing,  Junior. You ought to know by now that gravitation is the effect of the  curving of space-time around matter. Einstein proved that two hundred  years ago.\"\n\n\n \"Go back to your games, Grampa,\" Fred said impatiently. \"We've got work  to do.\" Grampa knitted his bushy, white eyebrows and petulantly pushed the last  button on his pircuit. The last light went out. \"You've got work to  do, have you? Whose flivver do you think this is, anyhow?\"\n\n\n \"It belongs to all of us,\" Four said shrilly. \"You gave us all a sixth  share.\"\n\n\n \"That's right, Four,\" Grampa muttered, \"so I did. But whose money  bought it?\"\n\n\n \"You bought it, Grampa,\" Fred said.\n\n\n \"That's right! And who invented the gravity polarizer and the space  flivver? Eh? Who made possible this gallivanting all over space?\"\n\n\n \"You, Grampa,\" Fred said.\n\n\n \"You bet! And who made one hundred million dollars out of it that the  rest of you vultures are just hanging around to gobble up when I die?\"\n\n\n \"And who spent it all trying to invent perpetual motion machines and  longevity pills,\" Joyce said bitterly, \"and fixed it so we'd have to  go searching for uranium and habitable worlds all through this deadly  galaxy? You, Grampa!\"\n\n\n \"Well, now,\" Grampa protested, \"I got a little put away yet. You'll be  sorry when I'm dead and gone.\"\n\n\n \"You're never going to die, Grampa,\" Joyce said harshly. \"Just  before we left, you bought a hundred-year contract with that  Life-Begins-At-Ninety longevity company.\"\n\n\n \"Well, now,\" said Grampa, blinking, \"how'd you find out about that?  Well, now!\" In confusion, he turned back to the pircuit and jabbed a  button. Thirteen slim lights sprang on. \"I'll get you this time!\"\n\n\n Four stretched and stood up. He looked curiously into the corner by the  computer where Grampa's chair stood. \"You brought that pircuit from  Earth, didn't you? What's the game?\"\n\n\n Grampa looked up, obviously relieved to drop his act of intense  concentration. \"I'll tell you, boy. You play against the pircuit,  taking turns, and you can put out one, two or three lights. The player  who makes the other one turn out the last light is the winner.\"\n\n\n \"That's simple,\" Four said without hesitation. \"The winning strategy is  to\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Don't be a kibitzer!\" Grampa snapped. \"When I need help, I'll ask  for it. No dad-blamed machine is gonna outthink Grampa!\" He snorted  indignantly. Four shrugged his narrow shoulders and wandered to the view screen.  Within it was the green horizon, curving noticeably. Four angled the  picture in toward the ship, sweeping through green, peaceful woodland  and plain and blue lake until he stared down into the meadow at the  flivver's stern.\n\n\n \"Look!\" he said suddenly. \"This planet not only has flora\u2014it has  fauna.\" He rushed to the air lock.\n\n\n \"Four!\" Reba called out warningly.\n\n\n \"It's all right, Reba,\" Four assured her. \"The air is within one per  cent of Earth-normal and the bio-analyzer can find no micro-organisms  viable within the Terran spectrum.\"\n\n\n \"What about macro-organisms\u2014\" Reba began, but the boy was gone  already. Reba's face was troubled. \"That boy!\" she said to Junior.  \"Sometimes I think we've made a terrible mistake with him. He should  have friends, play-mates. He's more like a little old man than a boy.\"\n\n\n But Junior nodded meaningfully at Fred and disappeared into the chart  room. Fred followed casually. Then, as the door slid shut behind him,  he asked impatiently. \"Well, what's all the mystery?\"\n\n\n \"No use bothering the others yet,\" Junior said, his face puzzled. \"You  see, I didn't let the flivver drop those last few inches. The polarizer  quit.\"\n\n\n \"Quit!\"\n\n\n \"That's not the worst. I tried to take it up again. The flivver\u2014it  won't budge!\" The thing was a featureless blob, a two-foot sphere of raspberry  gelatin, but it was alive. It rocked back and forth in front of Four.  It opened a raspberry-color pseudo-mouth and said plaintively, \"Fweep?  Fweep?\"\n\n\n Joyce drew her chair farther back toward the wall, revulsion on her  face. \"Four! Get that nasty thing out of here!\" \"You mean Fweep?\" Four asked in astonishment.\n\n\n \"I mean that thing, whatever you call it.\" Joyce fluttered her hand  impatiently. \"Get it out!\"\n\n\n Four's eyes widened farther. \"But Fweep's my friend.\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense!\" Joyce said sharply. \"Earthmen don't make friends with  aliens. And that's nothing but a\u2014a blob!\"\n\n\n \"Fweep?\" queried the raspberry lips. \"Fweep?\"\n\n\n \"If it's Four's friend,\" Reba said firmly, \"it can stay. If you don't  like to be around it, Grammy, you can always go to your own room.\"\n\n\n Joyce stood up indignantly. \"Well! And don't call me 'Grammy!' It makes  me sound as old as that old goat over there!\" She glared malignantly  at Grampa. \"If you'd rather have that blob than me\u2014well!\" She swept  grandly out of the central cabin and into one of the private rooms that  opened out from it.\n\n\n \"Fweep?\" asked the blob.\n\n\n \"Sure,\" Four said. \"Go ahead, fweep\u2014I mean sweep.\"\n\n\n Swiftly the sphere rolled across the floor. Behind it was left a  narrow path of sparkling clean tile.\n\n\n Grampa glanced warily at Joyce's door to make sure it was completely  closed and then cocked a white eyebrow at Reba. \"Good for you, Reba!\"  he said admiringly. \"For forty years now, I've wanted to do that. Never  had the nerve.\"\n\n\n \"Why, thanks, Grampa,\" Reba said, surprised.\n\n\n \"I like you, gal. Never forget it.\"\n\n\n \"I like you, too, Grampa. If you'd been a few years younger, Junior  would have had competition!\"\n\n\n \"You bet he would!\" Grampa leaned back and cackled. Then he leaned  over confidentially toward Reba and whispered, \"Beats me why you ever  married a jerk like Junior, anyhow.\"\n\n\n Reba looked thoughtfully toward the airlock door. \"Maybe I saw  something in him nobody else saw, the man he might become. He's been  submerged in this family too long; he's still a child to all of you  and to himself, too.\" Reba smiled at Grampa brilliantly. \"And maybe I  thought he might grow into a man like his grandfather.\" Grampa turned red and looked quickly toward Four. The boy was staring  intently at Fweep. \"What you doing, Four?\"\n\n\n \"Trying to figure out what Fweep does with the sweepings,\" Four said  absently. \"The outer inch or two of his body gets cloudy and then  slowly clears. I think I'll try him with a bigger particle.\"\n\n\n \"That's the idea, Four. You'll be a Peppergrass yet. How about building  me a pircuit?\"\n\n\n \"You get the other one figured out?\"\n\n\n \"It was easy,\" Grampa said breezily, \"once you understood the  principle. The player who moved second could always win if he used the  right strategy. Dividing the thirteen lights into three sections of  four each\u2014\"\n\n\n \"That's right,\" Four agreed. \"I can make you a new one by cannibalizing  the other pircuit, but I'll need a few extra parts.\"\n\n\n Grampa pushed the wall beside his chair and a drawer slid out of it.\n\n\n Inside were row after row of nipple-topped, flat-sided, flexible  free-fall bottles and a battered cigar box. \"Thought you'd say that,\"  he said, picking out the box. \"Help yourself.\" With the other hand, he  lifted out one of the bottles and took a long drag on it. \"Ahhh!\" he  sighed, wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, and carefully put  the bottle away.\n\n\n \"What is that stuff you drink, Grampa?\" Four asked.\n\n\n \"Tonic, boy. Keeps me young and frisky. Now about that pircuit\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Did you ever work on Niccol\u00f2 Tartaglia's puzzle about the three lovely  brides, the three jealous husbands, the river and the two-passenger  rowboat?\"\n\n\n \"Yep,\" Grampa said. \"Too easy.\"\n\n\n Four thought a moment. \"There's a modern variation with three  missionaries and three cannibals. Same river, same rowboat and only one  of the cannibals can row. If the cannibals outnumber the missionaries\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sounds good, boy,\" Grampa said eagerly. \"Whip it up for me.\"\n\n\n \"Okay, Grampa.\" Four looked at Fweep again. The translucent sphere had  paused at Grampa's feet.\n\n\n Grampa reached down to pat it. For an instant, his hand disappeared  into Fweep, and then the alien creature rolled away. This time its path  seemed crooked.\n\n\n Its gelatinous form jiggled. \"Hic!\" it said. As if in response, the flivver vibrated. Grampa looked querulously  toward the airlock. \"Flivver shouldn't shake like that. Not with the  polarizer turned on.\"\n\n\n The airlock door swung inward. Through the oval doorway walked Fred,  followed closely by Junior. They were sweat-stained and weary,  scintillation counters dangling heavily from their belts.\n\n\n \"Any luck?\" Reba asked brightly.\n\n\n \"Do we look it?\" Junior grumbled.\n\n\n \"Where's Joyce?\" asked Fred. \"Might as well get everybody in on this at  once. Joyce!\"\n\n\n The door to his wife's room opened instantly. Behind it, Joyce was  regal and slim. The pose was spoiled immediately by her avid question:  \"Any uranium? Radium? Thorium?\"\n\n\n \"No,\" Fred said slowly, \"and no other heavy metals, either. There's a  few low-grade iron deposits and that's it.\"\n\n\n \"Then what makes this planet so heavy?\" Reba asked.\n\n\n Junior shrugged helplessly and collapsed into a chair. \"Your guess is  as good as anybody's.\"\n\n\n \"Then we've wasted another week on a worthless rock,\" Joyce complained.  She turned savagely on Fred. \"This was going to make us all filthy  rich. We were going to find radioactives and retire to Earth like  billionaires. And all we've done is spent a year of our lives in this  cramped old flivver\u2014and we don't have many of them to spare!\" She  glared venomously at Grampa.\n\n\n \"We've still got Fweepland,\" Four said solemnly.\n\n\n \"Fweepland?\" Reba repeated.\n\n\n \"This planet. It's not big, but it's fertile and it's harmless. As  real estate, it's worth almost as much as if it were solid uranium.\"\n\n\n \"A good thing, too,\" Junior said glumly, \"because this looks like the  end of our search. Short of a miracle, we'll spend the rest of our  lives right here\u2014involuntary colonists.\"\n\n\n Joyce spun on him. \"You're joking!\" she screeched.\n\n\n \"I wish I were,\" Junior said. \"But the polarizer won't work. Either  it's broken or there's something about the gravity around here that  just won't polarize.\"\n\n\n \"It's these '23 models,\" Grampa put in disgustedly. \"They never were  any good.\" The land of the Fweep turned slowly on its axis. The orange sun set and  rose again and stared down once more at the meadow where the improbable  spaceship rested on its improbable stern. The sixteen Earth hours that  the rotation had taken had changed nothing inside the ship, either.\n\n\n Grampa looked up from his pircuit and said, \"If I were you, Junior, I  would take a good look at the TV repairman when we get back to Earth. If we get back to Earth,\" he amended. \"You can't be Four's father.  All over the Universe, gravity is the same, and if it's gravity, the  polarizer will polarize it.\"\n\n\n \"That's just supposition,\" Junior said stubbornly. \"The fact is, it  isn't because it doesn't. Q.E.D.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe the polarizer is broken,\" Fred suggested.\n\n\n Grampa snorted. \"Broken-shmoken. Nothing to break, Young Fred. Just a  few coils of copper wire and they're all right. We checked. We know  the power plant is working: the lights are on, the air and water  recirculation systems are going, the food resynthesizer is okay. And,  anyway, the polarizer could work from the storage battery if it had to.\"\n\n\n \"Then it goes deeper,\" Junior insisted. \"It goes right to the principle  of polarization itself. For some reason, it doesn't work here. Why?  Before we can discover the answer to that, we'll have to know more  about polarization itself. How does it work, Grampa?\"\n\n\n Grampa gave him a sarcastic grin. \"Now you're curious, eh? Couldn't  be bothered with Grampa's invention before. Oh, no! Too busy. Accept  without question the blessings that the Good Lord provideth\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Let's not get up on any pulpits,\" Fred growled. \"Come on, Grampa,  what's the theory behind polarization?\"\n\n\n Grampa looked at the four faces staring at him hopefully and the  jeering grin turned to a smile. \"Well,\" he said, \"at last. You know  how light is polarized, eh?\" The smile faded. \"No, I guess you don't.\" He cleared his throat professorially. \"Well, now, in ordinary light  the vibrations are perpendicular to the ray in all directions. When  light is polarized by passing through crystals or by reflection or  refraction at non-metallic surfaces, the paths of the vibrations are  still perpendicular to the ray, but they're in straight lines, circles  or ellipses.\"\n\n\n The faces were still blank and unillumined.\n\n\n \"Gravity is similar to light,\" he pressed on. \"In the absence of  matter, gravity is non-polarized. Matter polarizes gravity in a circle  around itself. That's how we've always known it until the invention of  spaceships and later the polarizer. The polarizer polarizes gravity  into a straight line. That makes the ship take off and continue  accelerating until the polarizer is shut off or its angle is shifted.\"\n\n\n The faces looked at him silently. Finally Joyce could endure it no  longer. \"That's just nonsense! You all know it. Grampa's no genius.  He's just a tinkerer. One day he happened to tinker out the polarizer.  He doesn't know how it works any more than I do.\"\n\n\n \"Now wait a minute!\" Grampa protested. \"That's not fair. Maybe  I didn't figure out the theory myself, but I read everything the  scientists ever wrote about it. Wanted to know myself what made the  blamed thing work. What I told you is what the scientists said, near  as I remember. Now me\u2014I'm like Edison. I do it and let everybody else  worry over 'why.'\"\n\n\n \"The only thing you ever did was the polarizer,\" Joyce snapped.  \"And then you spent everything you got from it on those fool  perpetual-motion machines and those crazy longevity schemes when any  moron would know they were impossible.\"\n\n\n Grampa squinted at her sagely. \"That's what they said about the gravity  polarizer before I invented it.\"\n\n\n \"But you don't really know why it works,\" Junior persisted.\n\n\n \"Well, no,\" Grampa admitted. \"Actually I was just fiddling around with  some coils when one of them took off. Went right through the ceiling,  dragging a battery behind it. I guess it's still going. Ought to be out  near the Horsehead Nebula by now. Luckily, I remembered how I'd wound  it.\"\n\n\n \"Why won't the ship work then, if you know so much?\" Joyce demanded  ironically.\n\n\n \"Well, now,\" Grampa said in bafflement, \"it rightly should, you know.\" \"We're stuck,\" Reba said softly. \"We might as well admit it. All we can  do is set the transmitter to send out an automatic distress call\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Which,\" Joyce interrupted, \"might get picked up in a few centuries.\"\n\n\n \"And make the best of what we've got,\" Reba went on, unheeding. \"If we  look at it the right way, it's quite a lot. A beautiful, fertile world.  Earth gravity. The flivver\u2014even if the polarizer won't work, there's  the resynthesizer; it will keep us in food and clothes for years. By  then, we should have a good-sized community built up, because out here  we won't have to stop with one child. We can have all the babies we  want.\"\n\n\n \"You know the law: one child per couple,\" Joyce reminded her frigidly.  \"You can condemn yourself to exile from civilization if you wish. Not  me.\"\n\n\n Junior frowned at his wife. \"I believe you're actually glad it  happened.\"\n\n\n \"I could think of worse things,\" Reba said.\n\n\n \"I like your spunk, Reb,\" Grampa muttered.\n\n\n \"Speaking of children,\" Junior said, \"where's Four?\"\n\n\n \"Here.\" Four came through the airlock and trudged across the room,  carrying a curious contraption made of tripod legs supporting a  small box from which dangled a plumb bob. Behind Four, like a round,  raspberry shadow, rolled Fweep.\n\n\n \"Fweep?\" it queried hopefully.\n\n\n \"Not now,\" said Four.\n\n\n \"Where've you been?\" Reba asked anxiously. \"What've you been doing?\"\n\n\n \"I've been all over Fweepland,\" Four said wearily, \"trying to locate  its center of gravity.\"\n\n\n \"Well?\" Fred prompted.\n\n\n \"It shifts.\"\n\n\n \"That's impossible,\" said Junior.\n\n\n \"Not for Fweep,\" Four replied.\n\n\n \"What do you mean by that?\" Joyce suspiciously asked.\n\n\n \"It shifted,\" Four explained patiently, \"because Fweep kept following  me.\"\n\n\n \"Fweep?\" Junior repeated stupidly.\n\n\n \"Fweep?\" Fweep said eagerly.\n\n\n \"He's why the flivver won't work. What Grampa invented was a linear  polarizer. Fweep is a circular polarizer. He's what makes this planet  so heavy. He's why we can't leave.\" The land of the Fweep rotated once on its axis, and Grampa lowered  the nippled bottle from his lips. He sighed. \"I got it figured out,  Four,\" he said, holding out the pircuit proudly. \"A missionary takes  over a non-rowing type cannibal, leaves him there, and then the rowing  cannibal takes over the other cannibal and leaves him there and\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Not now, Grampa,\" Four said inattentively as he watched Fweep making  the grand tour of the cabin.\n\n\n The raspberry sphere swept over a scattering of crumbs, engulfed them,  absorbed them. Four looked at Joyce. Joyce was watching Fweep, too.\n\n\n \"Rat poison?\" Four asked.\n\n\n Joyce started guiltily. \"How did you know?\"\n\n\n \"There's no use trying to poison Fweep,\" Four said calmly. \"He's got no  enzymes to act on, no nervous system to paralyze. He doesn't even use  what he 'eats' on a molecular level at all.\"\n\n\n \"What level does he use?\" Junior wanted to know.\n\n\n \"Point the scintillation counter at him.\"\n\n\n Junior dug one of the counters out of the supply cabinet and aimed the  pickup at Fweep. The counter began to hum. As Fweep approached, the hum  rose in pitch. As it passed, the hum dropped.\n\n\n Junior looked at the counter's dial. \"He's radioactive, all right. Not  much, but enough. But where does he get the radioactive material?\"\n\n\n \"He uses ordinary matter,\" Four said. \"He must have used up the few  deposits of natural radioactives a long time ago.\"\n\n\n \"He uses ordinary substances on an atomic level?\" Junior said  unbelievingly.\n\n\n Four nodded. \"And that 'skin' of his\u2014whatever it is he uses for  skin\u2014is more efficient in stopping particle emissions than several  feet of lead.\"\n\n\n Fred studied Fweep thoughtfully. \"Maybe we could feed him enough  enriched uranium from the pile to put him over the critical mass.\"\n\n\n \"And blow him up? I don't think it's possible, but even if it were, it  might be a trifle more than disastrous for us.\" Four giggled at the  thought. Joyce glared at him furiously. \"Four! Act your age! We've got to do  something with him. It's preposterous that we should be detained here  at the whim of a mere blob!\"\n\n\n \"I don't figure it's a whim,\" Grampa said. \"Circular gravity is what  he's got to have for one reason or another, so he just naturally bends  the space-time continuum around him\u2014conscious or subconscious, I don't  know. But protoplasm is always more efficient than machines, so the  flivver won't move.\"\n\n\n \"I don't care why that thing does it,\" Joyce said icily. \"I want it  stopped, and the sooner the better. If it won't turn the gravity off,  we'll just have to do away with it.\"\n\n\n \"How?\" asked Four. \"Fweep's skin is pretty close to impervious and  you can't shoot him, stab him or poison him. He doesn't breathe, so  you can't drown or strangle him. You can't imprison him; he 'eats'  everything. And violence might be more dangerous to us than to him.  Right now, Fweep is friendly, but suppose he got mad! He could lower  his radioactive shield or he might increase the gravity by a few times.  Either way, you'd feel rather uncomfortable, Grammy.\"\n\n\n \"Don't call me 'Grammy!' Well, what are we going to do, just sit around  and wait for that thing to die?\"\n\n\n \"We'd have a long wait,\" Four observed. \"Fweep is the only one of his  kind on this planet.\"\n\n\n \"Well?\"\n\n\n \"Probably he's immortal.\"\n\n\n \"And he doesn't reproduce?\" Reba asked sympathetically.\n\n\n \"Probably not. If he doesn't die, there's no point in reproduction.  Reproduction is nature's way of providing racial immortality to mortal  creatures.\"\n\n\n \"But he must have some way of reproduction,\" Reba argued. \"An egg or  something. He couldn't just have sprung into being as he is now.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe he developed,\" Four offered. \"It seems to me that he's bigger  than when we first landed.\" \"He must have been here a long, long time,\"  Fred said. \"Fweepland, as Four calls it, kept its atmosphere and its  water, which a planet this size ordinarily would have lost by now.\" Reba looked at Fweep kindly. \"We can thank the little fellow for that,  anyway.\"\n\n\n \"I thank him for nothing,\" Joyce snapped. \"He lured us down here by  making us think the planet had heavy metals and I want him to let us go immediately !\"\n\n\n Fred turned impatiently on his wife. \"Well, try making him understand!  And if you can make him understand what you want him to do, try making  him do it!\"\n\n\n Joyce looked at Fred with startled eyes. \"Fred!\" she said in a high,  shocked voice and turned blindly toward her room.\n\n\n Grampa lowered his bottle and smacked his lips. \"Well, boy,\" he said to  Fred, \"I thought you'd never do that. Didn't think you had it in you.\"\n\n\n Fred stood up apologetically. \"I'd better go calm her down,\" he  muttered, and walked quickly after Joyce.\n\n\n \"Give her one for me!\" Grampa called.\n\n\n Fred's shoulders twitched as the door closed behind him. From the room  came the filtered sound of high-pitched voices rising and falling like  some reedy folk music.\n\n\n \"Makes you think, doesn't it?\" Grampa said, looking at Fweep benignly.  \"Maybe the whole theory of gravitation is cockeyed. Maybe there's a  Fweep for every planet and sun, big and little, polarizing the gravity  in circles, and the matter business is not a cause but a result.\"\n\n\n \"What I can't understand,\" Junior said thoughtfully, \"is why the  polarizer worked for a little while when we landed\u2014long enough to keep  us from being squashed\u2014and then quit.\"\n\n\n \"Fweep didn't recognize it immediately, didn't know what it was or  where it came from,\" Four explained. \"All he knew was he didn't like  linear polarization and he neutralized it as soon as he could. That's  when we dropped.\" \"Linear polarization is uncomfortable for him, is it?\" Grampa said.  \"Makes you wonder how something like Fweep could ever develop.\"\n\n\n \"He's no more improbable than people,\" said Four.\n\n\n \"Less than some I've known,\" Grampa conceded.\n\n\n \"If he can eat anything,\" Reba said, \"why does he keep sweeping the  cabin for dust and lint?\"\n\n\n \"He wants to be helpful,\" Four replied without hesitation, \"and he's  lonely. After all,\" he added wistfully, \"he's never had any friends.\"\n\n\n \"How do you know all these things?\" Joyce asked from her doorway,  excitement in her voice. \"Can you talk to it?\"\n\n\n Behind her, Fred said, \"Now, Joyce, you promised\u2014\"\n\n\n \"But this is important,\" Joyce cut him off eagerly. \"Can you? Talk to  it, I mean?\"\n\n\n \"Some,\" Four admitted.\n\n\n \"Have you asked it to let us go?\"\n\n\n \"Yes.\"\n\n\n \"Well? What did it say?\"\n\n\n \"He said he didn't want his friend to leave him.\"\n\n\n At the word, Fweep rolled swiftly across the floor and bounced into  Four's lap. It nestled against him lovingly and opened raspberry lips.  \"Fwiend,\" it said.\n\n\n \"Well, now,\" Grampa said maliciously, his eye on Joyce, \"that's no  problem. We can just leave Four here with Fweep.\"\n\n\n In a voice filled with sanctimonious concern, Joyce said, \"That's quite  a sacrifice to ask, but\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Joyce!\" Reba cried, horrified. \"Grampa was joking, but you actually  mean it. Four is only a baby and yet you'd let him\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Never mind, Reba,\" Four said evenly. \"It was just what I was going to  suggest myself. It's the one really logical solution.\"\n\n\n \"Fwiend,\" said Fweep gently. The land of the Fweep turned like a fat old man toasting himself in  front of an open fire, and Junior sat at the computer's keyboard  swearing in a steady monotone.\n\n\n \"Junior!\" said Joyce, shocked.\n\n\n Junior swung around impatiently. \"Sorry, Mother, but this damned thing  won't work.\"\n\n\n \"I'm sure that calling it names won't help, and besides, you shouldn't  expect a machine to do something that we can't do. And if it did work,  it would only say that the logical answer is the one I sug\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Mother!\" Junior warned. \"We decided not to talk about it any more.  Four is strange enough without encouraging him to think like a martyr.  It's out of the question. If that's the only way we can leave this  planet, we'll stay here until Four has a beard as white as Grampa's!\"\n\n\n \"Well!\" Joyce said in a stiff, offended tone and sat back in her chair.\n\n\n Grampa lowered the nippled bottle from his lips and chortled. \"Junior,  I apologize for all the mean things I ever said about you. Maybe you  got the makings of a Peppergrass yet.\"\n\n\n Junior turned back to the keyboard and studied it, his chin in his  hand. \"It's just a matter of stating the problem in terms the computer  can work on.\"\n\n\n \"I take it all back,\" said Grampa. \"That computer won't help you with  this problem, Junior. This ain't a long, complicated calculation; it's  a simple problem in logic. It's a pircuit problem, like the one about  the cannibals and the missionaries. We can't leave Fweepland because  Fweep won't let our polarizer work. He won't let our polarizer work  because he doesn't like gravity that's polarized in a straight line,  and he don't want Four to leave him.\n\n\n \"Now Fweep ain't the brightest creature in the Universe, so he can't  understand why we're so gosh-fired eager to leave. And as long as he's  got Four, he's happy. Why should he make himself unhappy? As a favor  to Four, he'd let us leave\u2014if we'd leave Four here with him, which we  ain't gonna do.\n\n\n \"That's the problem. All we got to do is figure out the answer. No use  making a pircuit, because a puzzle circuit is just a miniature computer  with the solution built in; if you can build the pircuit, you've  already solved the problem. And if you can state the problem to Abacus,  you've already got the answer. All you want from it then is decimal  points.\"\n\n\n \"That may be,\" Junior said stubbornly, \"but I still want to know why  this computer won't work. It won't even do simple arithmetic! Where's  Four? He's the only one who understands this thing.\"\n\n\n \"He's outside, playing in the meadow with Fweep,\" Reba said, her voice  soft. \"No, here they come now.\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWho was most in favor of staying on the planet?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Four\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Reba\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Reba\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Reba\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Fweep is a circular polarizer\u201d (p. 44). By feeding and hosting Fweep, Four ensures the linear polarizer never functions.  \n\u2022 He warns that violence \u201cmight be a trifle more than disastrous for us\u201d (p. 44).

She values civilization\u2019s norms, not true colonization (p. 53).  \n\u2022 Reba\u2019s statement \u201cIf you don\u2019t like to be around it, Grammy, you can always go to your own room\u201d (p. 27) merely resolves immediate discomfort, not long-term plan.

Four\u2019s Long-Term Settlement Mindset  \n\u2022 Four\u2019s relentless study of gravity (\u201ccenter of gravity\u201d) implies not escape but mastery\u2014characteristic of colonists adapting to new world.  \n\u2022 Four imagines Fweep\u2019s reproduction \u201cif he doesn\u2019t die \u2026 no point in reproduction\u201d (p. 45), showing biological concern for species continuity on Fweepland.  \n\u2022 His calm acceptance of \u201cinvoluntary colonists\u201d status (\u201cwe\u2019ll stay\u2026until Four has a beard as white as Grampa\u2019s!\u201d p. 64) is self-fulfilling prognostication.  \n\n5.

Real initiative lies in Four\u2019s continued exploration.  \n5.3 B misreads Four\u2019s puzzle-making as escape plan. \u201cPircuit\u201d puzzles are his means of intellectual engagement when no departure; he builds cannibal puzzle simply to amuse Grampa, not to effect escape, since he knows it cannot persuade Fweep.  \n\n6. Conclusion  \nFour\u2019s unwavering companionship with Fweep, his voluntary self-exile, his thwarting of escape attempts, and his sustained settlement efforts demonstrate that he alone truly prefers staying on Fweepland.

The flivver descended vertically toward the green planet circling the  old, orange sun.\n\n\n It was a spaceship, but not the kind men had once dreamed about. The  flivver was shaped like a crude bullet, blunt at one end of a fat  cylinder and tapering abruptly to a point at the other. It had been  slapped together out of sheet metal and insulation board, and it sold,  fully equipped, for $15,730. It didn't behave like a spaceship, either.\n\n\n As it hurtled down, its speed increased with dramatic swiftness. Then,  at the last instant before impact, it stopped. Just like that.\n\n\n A moment later, it thumped a last few inches into the ankle-deep grass  and knee-high white flowers of the meadow. It was a shock of a jar that  made the sheet-metal walls boom like thunder machines. The flivver  rocked unsteadily on its flat stern before it decided to stay upright.\n\n\n Then all was quiet\u2014outside.\n\n\n Inside the big, central cabin, Grampa waved his pircuit irately in the  air. \"Now look what you made me do! Just when I had the blamed thing  practically whipped, too!\" Grampa was a white-haired 90-year-old who could still go a fast round  or two with a man (or woman) half his age, but he had a habit of  lapsing into tantrum when he got annoyed.\n\n\n \"Now, Grampa,\" Fred soothed, but his face was concerned. Fred, once  called Young Fred, was Grampa's only son. He was sixty and his hair had  begun to gray at the temples. \"That landing was pretty rough, Junior.\" Junior was Fred's only son. Because he was thirty-five and capable  of exercising adult judgment and because he had the youngest adult  reflexes, he sat in the pilot's chair, the control stick between his  knees, his thumb still over the Off-On button on top. \"I know it,  Fred,\" he said, frowning. \"This world fooled me. It has a diameter  less than that of Mercury and yet a gravitational pull as great as  Earth.\"\n\n\n Grampa started to say something, but an 8-year-old boy looked up from  the navigator's table beside the big computer and said, \"Well, gosh,  Junior, that's why we picked this planet. We fed all the orbital data  into Abacus, and Abacus said that orbital perturbations indicated that  the second planet was unusually heavy for its size. Then Fred said,  'That looks like heavy metals', and you said, 'Maybe uranium\u2014'\"\n\n\n \"That's enough, Four,\" Junior interrupted. \"Never mind what I said.\"\n\n\n Those were the Peppergrass men, four generations of them, looking  remarkably alike, although some vital element seemed to have dwindled  until Four looked pale and thin-faced and wizened.\n\n\n \"And, Four,\" Reba said automatically, \"don't call your father 'Junior.'  It sounds disrespectful.\"\n\n\n Reba was Four's mother and Junior's wife. On her own, she was a  red-haired beauty with the loveliest figure this side of Antares. That  Junior had won her was, to Grampa, the most hopeful thing he had ever  noticed about the boy.\n\n\n \"But everybody calls Junior 'Junior,'\" Four complained. \"Besides, Fred  is Junior's father and Junior calls him 'Fred.'\"\n\n\n \"That's different,\" Reba said.\n\n\n Grampa was still waving his puzzle circuit indignantly. \"See!\" The  pircuit was a flat box equipped with pushbuttons and thirteen slender  openings in the top. One of the openings was lighted. \"That landing  made me push the wrong button and the dad-blasted thing beat me again.\"\n\n\n \"Stop picking on Junior,\" Joyce said sharply. She was Junior's mother  and Fred's wife, still slim and handsome as she approached sixty, but  somehow ice water had replaced the warm blood in her veins. \"I'm sure  he did the best he could.\"\n\n\n \"Anybody talks about gravitational pull,\" Grampa said, snorting,  \"deserves anything anybody could say about him. There's no such thing,  Junior. You ought to know by now that gravitation is the effect of the  curving of space-time around matter. Einstein proved that two hundred  years ago.\"\n\n\n \"Go back to your games, Grampa,\" Fred said impatiently. \"We've got work  to do.\" Grampa knitted his bushy, white eyebrows and petulantly pushed the last  button on his pircuit. The last light went out. \"You've got work to  do, have you? Whose flivver do you think this is, anyhow?\"\n\n\n \"It belongs to all of us,\" Four said shrilly. \"You gave us all a sixth  share.\"\n\n\n \"That's right, Four,\" Grampa muttered, \"so I did. But whose money  bought it?\"\n\n\n \"You bought it, Grampa,\" Fred said.\n\n\n \"That's right! And who invented the gravity polarizer and the space  flivver? Eh? Who made possible this gallivanting all over space?\"\n\n\n \"You, Grampa,\" Fred said.\n\n\n \"You bet! And who made one hundred million dollars out of it that the  rest of you vultures are just hanging around to gobble up when I die?\"\n\n\n \"And who spent it all trying to invent perpetual motion machines and  longevity pills,\" Joyce said bitterly, \"and fixed it so we'd have to  go searching for uranium and habitable worlds all through this deadly  galaxy? You, Grampa!\"\n\n\n \"Well, now,\" Grampa protested, \"I got a little put away yet. You'll be  sorry when I'm dead and gone.\"\n\n\n \"You're never going to die, Grampa,\" Joyce said harshly. \"Just  before we left, you bought a hundred-year contract with that  Life-Begins-At-Ninety longevity company.\"\n\n\n \"Well, now,\" said Grampa, blinking, \"how'd you find out about that?  Well, now!\" In confusion, he turned back to the pircuit and jabbed a  button. Thirteen slim lights sprang on. \"I'll get you this time!\"\n\n\n Four stretched and stood up. He looked curiously into the corner by the  computer where Grampa's chair stood. \"You brought that pircuit from  Earth, didn't you? What's the game?\"\n\n\n Grampa looked up, obviously relieved to drop his act of intense  concentration. \"I'll tell you, boy. You play against the pircuit,  taking turns, and you can put out one, two or three lights. The player  who makes the other one turn out the last light is the winner.\"\n\n\n \"That's simple,\" Four said without hesitation. \"The winning strategy is  to\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Don't be a kibitzer!\" Grampa snapped. \"When I need help, I'll ask  for it. No dad-blamed machine is gonna outthink Grampa!\" He snorted  indignantly. Four shrugged his narrow shoulders and wandered to the view screen.  Within it was the green horizon, curving noticeably. Four angled the  picture in toward the ship, sweeping through green, peaceful woodland  and plain and blue lake until he stared down into the meadow at the  flivver's stern.\n\n\n \"Look!\" he said suddenly. \"This planet not only has flora\u2014it has  fauna.\" He rushed to the air lock.\n\n\n \"Four!\" Reba called out warningly.\n\n\n \"It's all right, Reba,\" Four assured her. \"The air is within one per  cent of Earth-normal and the bio-analyzer can find no micro-organisms  viable within the Terran spectrum.\"\n\n\n \"What about macro-organisms\u2014\" Reba began, but the boy was gone  already. Reba's face was troubled. \"That boy!\" she said to Junior.  \"Sometimes I think we've made a terrible mistake with him. He should  have friends, play-mates. He's more like a little old man than a boy.\"\n\n\n But Junior nodded meaningfully at Fred and disappeared into the chart  room. Fred followed casually. Then, as the door slid shut behind him,  he asked impatiently. \"Well, what's all the mystery?\"\n\n\n \"No use bothering the others yet,\" Junior said, his face puzzled. \"You  see, I didn't let the flivver drop those last few inches. The polarizer  quit.\"\n\n\n \"Quit!\"\n\n\n \"That's not the worst. I tried to take it up again. The flivver\u2014it  won't budge!\" The thing was a featureless blob, a two-foot sphere of raspberry  gelatin, but it was alive. It rocked back and forth in front of Four.  It opened a raspberry-color pseudo-mouth and said plaintively, \"Fweep?  Fweep?\"\n\n\n Joyce drew her chair farther back toward the wall, revulsion on her  face. \"Four! Get that nasty thing out of here!\" \"You mean Fweep?\" Four asked in astonishment.\n\n\n \"I mean that thing, whatever you call it.\" Joyce fluttered her hand  impatiently. \"Get it out!\"\n\n\n Four's eyes widened farther. \"But Fweep's my friend.\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense!\" Joyce said sharply. \"Earthmen don't make friends with  aliens. And that's nothing but a\u2014a blob!\"\n\n\n \"Fweep?\" queried the raspberry lips. \"Fweep?\"\n\n\n \"If it's Four's friend,\" Reba said firmly, \"it can stay. If you don't  like to be around it, Grammy, you can always go to your own room.\"\n\n\n Joyce stood up indignantly. \"Well! And don't call me 'Grammy!' It makes  me sound as old as that old goat over there!\" She glared malignantly  at Grampa. \"If you'd rather have that blob than me\u2014well!\" She swept  grandly out of the central cabin and into one of the private rooms that  opened out from it.\n\n\n \"Fweep?\" asked the blob.\n\n\n \"Sure,\" Four said. \"Go ahead, fweep\u2014I mean sweep.\"\n\n\n Swiftly the sphere rolled across the floor. Behind it was left a  narrow path of sparkling clean tile.\n\n\n Grampa glanced warily at Joyce's door to make sure it was completely  closed and then cocked a white eyebrow at Reba. \"Good for you, Reba!\"  he said admiringly. \"For forty years now, I've wanted to do that. Never  had the nerve.\"\n\n\n \"Why, thanks, Grampa,\" Reba said, surprised.\n\n\n \"I like you, gal. Never forget it.\"\n\n\n \"I like you, too, Grampa. If you'd been a few years younger, Junior  would have had competition!\"\n\n\n \"You bet he would!\" Grampa leaned back and cackled. Then he leaned  over confidentially toward Reba and whispered, \"Beats me why you ever  married a jerk like Junior, anyhow.\"\n\n\n Reba looked thoughtfully toward the airlock door. \"Maybe I saw  something in him nobody else saw, the man he might become. He's been  submerged in this family too long; he's still a child to all of you  and to himself, too.\" Reba smiled at Grampa brilliantly. \"And maybe I  thought he might grow into a man like his grandfather.\" Grampa turned red and looked quickly toward Four. The boy was staring  intently at Fweep. \"What you doing, Four?\"\n\n\n \"Trying to figure out what Fweep does with the sweepings,\" Four said  absently. \"The outer inch or two of his body gets cloudy and then  slowly clears. I think I'll try him with a bigger particle.\"\n\n\n \"That's the idea, Four. You'll be a Peppergrass yet. How about building  me a pircuit?\"\n\n\n \"You get the other one figured out?\"\n\n\n \"It was easy,\" Grampa said breezily, \"once you understood the  principle. The player who moved second could always win if he used the  right strategy. Dividing the thirteen lights into three sections of  four each\u2014\"\n\n\n \"That's right,\" Four agreed. \"I can make you a new one by cannibalizing  the other pircuit, but I'll need a few extra parts.\"\n\n\n Grampa pushed the wall beside his chair and a drawer slid out of it.\n\n\n Inside were row after row of nipple-topped, flat-sided, flexible  free-fall bottles and a battered cigar box. \"Thought you'd say that,\"  he said, picking out the box. \"Help yourself.\" With the other hand, he  lifted out one of the bottles and took a long drag on it. \"Ahhh!\" he  sighed, wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, and carefully put  the bottle away.\n\n\n \"What is that stuff you drink, Grampa?\" Four asked.\n\n\n \"Tonic, boy. Keeps me young and frisky. Now about that pircuit\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Did you ever work on Niccol\u00f2 Tartaglia's puzzle about the three lovely  brides, the three jealous husbands, the river and the two-passenger  rowboat?\"\n\n\n \"Yep,\" Grampa said. \"Too easy.\"\n\n\n Four thought a moment. \"There's a modern variation with three  missionaries and three cannibals. Same river, same rowboat and only one  of the cannibals can row. If the cannibals outnumber the missionaries\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sounds good, boy,\" Grampa said eagerly. \"Whip it up for me.\"\n\n\n \"Okay, Grampa.\" Four looked at Fweep again. The translucent sphere had  paused at Grampa's feet.\n\n\n Grampa reached down to pat it. For an instant, his hand disappeared  into Fweep, and then the alien creature rolled away. This time its path  seemed crooked.\n\n\n Its gelatinous form jiggled. \"Hic!\" it said. As if in response, the flivver vibrated. Grampa looked querulously  toward the airlock. \"Flivver shouldn't shake like that. Not with the  polarizer turned on.\"\n\n\n The airlock door swung inward. Through the oval doorway walked Fred,  followed closely by Junior. They were sweat-stained and weary,  scintillation counters dangling heavily from their belts.\n\n\n \"Any luck?\" Reba asked brightly.\n\n\n \"Do we look it?\" Junior grumbled.\n\n\n \"Where's Joyce?\" asked Fred. \"Might as well get everybody in on this at  once. Joyce!\"\n\n\n The door to his wife's room opened instantly. Behind it, Joyce was  regal and slim. The pose was spoiled immediately by her avid question:  \"Any uranium? Radium? Thorium?\"\n\n\n \"No,\" Fred said slowly, \"and no other heavy metals, either. There's a  few low-grade iron deposits and that's it.\"\n\n\n \"Then what makes this planet so heavy?\" Reba asked.\n\n\n Junior shrugged helplessly and collapsed into a chair. \"Your guess is  as good as anybody's.\"\n\n\n \"Then we've wasted another week on a worthless rock,\" Joyce complained.  She turned savagely on Fred. \"This was going to make us all filthy  rich. We were going to find radioactives and retire to Earth like  billionaires. And all we've done is spent a year of our lives in this  cramped old flivver\u2014and we don't have many of them to spare!\" She  glared venomously at Grampa.\n\n\n \"We've still got Fweepland,\" Four said solemnly.\n\n\n \"Fweepland?\" Reba repeated.\n\n\n \"This planet. It's not big, but it's fertile and it's harmless. As  real estate, it's worth almost as much as if it were solid uranium.\"\n\n\n \"A good thing, too,\" Junior said glumly, \"because this looks like the  end of our search. Short of a miracle, we'll spend the rest of our  lives right here\u2014involuntary colonists.\"\n\n\n Joyce spun on him. \"You're joking!\" she screeched.\n\n\n \"I wish I were,\" Junior said. \"But the polarizer won't work. Either  it's broken or there's something about the gravity around here that  just won't polarize.\"\n\n\n \"It's these '23 models,\" Grampa put in disgustedly. \"They never were  any good.\" The land of the Fweep turned slowly on its axis. The orange sun set and  rose again and stared down once more at the meadow where the improbable  spaceship rested on its improbable stern. The sixteen Earth hours that  the rotation had taken had changed nothing inside the ship, either.\n\n\n Grampa looked up from his pircuit and said, \"If I were you, Junior, I  would take a good look at the TV repairman when we get back to Earth. If we get back to Earth,\" he amended. \"You can't be Four's father.  All over the Universe, gravity is the same, and if it's gravity, the  polarizer will polarize it.\"\n\n\n \"That's just supposition,\" Junior said stubbornly. \"The fact is, it  isn't because it doesn't. Q.E.D.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe the polarizer is broken,\" Fred suggested.\n\n\n Grampa snorted. \"Broken-shmoken. Nothing to break, Young Fred. Just a  few coils of copper wire and they're all right. We checked. We know  the power plant is working: the lights are on, the air and water  recirculation systems are going, the food resynthesizer is okay. And,  anyway, the polarizer could work from the storage battery if it had to.\"\n\n\n \"Then it goes deeper,\" Junior insisted. \"It goes right to the principle  of polarization itself. For some reason, it doesn't work here. Why?  Before we can discover the answer to that, we'll have to know more  about polarization itself. How does it work, Grampa?\"\n\n\n Grampa gave him a sarcastic grin. \"Now you're curious, eh? Couldn't  be bothered with Grampa's invention before. Oh, no! Too busy. Accept  without question the blessings that the Good Lord provideth\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Let's not get up on any pulpits,\" Fred growled. \"Come on, Grampa,  what's the theory behind polarization?\"\n\n\n Grampa looked at the four faces staring at him hopefully and the  jeering grin turned to a smile. \"Well,\" he said, \"at last. You know  how light is polarized, eh?\" The smile faded. \"No, I guess you don't.\" He cleared his throat professorially. \"Well, now, in ordinary light  the vibrations are perpendicular to the ray in all directions. When  light is polarized by passing through crystals or by reflection or  refraction at non-metallic surfaces, the paths of the vibrations are  still perpendicular to the ray, but they're in straight lines, circles  or ellipses.\"\n\n\n The faces were still blank and unillumined.\n\n\n \"Gravity is similar to light,\" he pressed on. \"In the absence of  matter, gravity is non-polarized. Matter polarizes gravity in a circle  around itself. That's how we've always known it until the invention of  spaceships and later the polarizer. The polarizer polarizes gravity  into a straight line. That makes the ship take off and continue  accelerating until the polarizer is shut off or its angle is shifted.\"\n\n\n The faces looked at him silently. Finally Joyce could endure it no  longer. \"That's just nonsense! You all know it. Grampa's no genius.  He's just a tinkerer. One day he happened to tinker out the polarizer.  He doesn't know how it works any more than I do.\"\n\n\n \"Now wait a minute!\" Grampa protested. \"That's not fair. Maybe  I didn't figure out the theory myself, but I read everything the  scientists ever wrote about it. Wanted to know myself what made the  blamed thing work. What I told you is what the scientists said, near  as I remember. Now me\u2014I'm like Edison. I do it and let everybody else  worry over 'why.'\"\n\n\n \"The only thing you ever did was the polarizer,\" Joyce snapped.  \"And then you spent everything you got from it on those fool  perpetual-motion machines and those crazy longevity schemes when any  moron would know they were impossible.\"\n\n\n Grampa squinted at her sagely. \"That's what they said about the gravity  polarizer before I invented it.\"\n\n\n \"But you don't really know why it works,\" Junior persisted.\n\n\n \"Well, no,\" Grampa admitted. \"Actually I was just fiddling around with  some coils when one of them took off. Went right through the ceiling,  dragging a battery behind it. I guess it's still going. Ought to be out  near the Horsehead Nebula by now. Luckily, I remembered how I'd wound  it.\"\n\n\n \"Why won't the ship work then, if you know so much?\" Joyce demanded  ironically.\n\n\n \"Well, now,\" Grampa said in bafflement, \"it rightly should, you know.\" \"We're stuck,\" Reba said softly. \"We might as well admit it. All we can  do is set the transmitter to send out an automatic distress call\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Which,\" Joyce interrupted, \"might get picked up in a few centuries.\"\n\n\n \"And make the best of what we've got,\" Reba went on, unheeding. \"If we  look at it the right way, it's quite a lot. A beautiful, fertile world.  Earth gravity. The flivver\u2014even if the polarizer won't work, there's  the resynthesizer; it will keep us in food and clothes for years. By  then, we should have a good-sized community built up, because out here  we won't have to stop with one child. We can have all the babies we  want.\"\n\n\n \"You know the law: one child per couple,\" Joyce reminded her frigidly.  \"You can condemn yourself to exile from civilization if you wish. Not  me.\"\n\n\n Junior frowned at his wife. \"I believe you're actually glad it  happened.\"\n\n\n \"I could think of worse things,\" Reba said.\n\n\n \"I like your spunk, Reb,\" Grampa muttered.\n\n\n \"Speaking of children,\" Junior said, \"where's Four?\"\n\n\n \"Here.\" Four came through the airlock and trudged across the room,  carrying a curious contraption made of tripod legs supporting a  small box from which dangled a plumb bob. Behind Four, like a round,  raspberry shadow, rolled Fweep.\n\n\n \"Fweep?\" it queried hopefully.\n\n\n \"Not now,\" said Four.\n\n\n \"Where've you been?\" Reba asked anxiously. \"What've you been doing?\"\n\n\n \"I've been all over Fweepland,\" Four said wearily, \"trying to locate  its center of gravity.\"\n\n\n \"Well?\" Fred prompted.\n\n\n \"It shifts.\"\n\n\n \"That's impossible,\" said Junior.\n\n\n \"Not for Fweep,\" Four replied.\n\n\n \"What do you mean by that?\" Joyce suspiciously asked.\n\n\n \"It shifted,\" Four explained patiently, \"because Fweep kept following  me.\"\n\n\n \"Fweep?\" Junior repeated stupidly.\n\n\n \"Fweep?\" Fweep said eagerly.\n\n\n \"He's why the flivver won't work. What Grampa invented was a linear  polarizer. Fweep is a circular polarizer. He's what makes this planet  so heavy. He's why we can't leave.\" The land of the Fweep rotated once on its axis, and Grampa lowered  the nippled bottle from his lips. He sighed. \"I got it figured out,  Four,\" he said, holding out the pircuit proudly. \"A missionary takes  over a non-rowing type cannibal, leaves him there, and then the rowing  cannibal takes over the other cannibal and leaves him there and\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Not now, Grampa,\" Four said inattentively as he watched Fweep making  the grand tour of the cabin.\n\n\n The raspberry sphere swept over a scattering of crumbs, engulfed them,  absorbed them. Four looked at Joyce. Joyce was watching Fweep, too.\n\n\n \"Rat poison?\" Four asked.\n\n\n Joyce started guiltily. \"How did you know?\"\n\n\n \"There's no use trying to poison Fweep,\" Four said calmly. \"He's got no  enzymes to act on, no nervous system to paralyze. He doesn't even use  what he 'eats' on a molecular level at all.\"\n\n\n \"What level does he use?\" Junior wanted to know.\n\n\n \"Point the scintillation counter at him.\"\n\n\n Junior dug one of the counters out of the supply cabinet and aimed the  pickup at Fweep. The counter began to hum. As Fweep approached, the hum  rose in pitch. As it passed, the hum dropped.\n\n\n Junior looked at the counter's dial. \"He's radioactive, all right. Not  much, but enough. But where does he get the radioactive material?\"\n\n\n \"He uses ordinary matter,\" Four said. \"He must have used up the few  deposits of natural radioactives a long time ago.\"\n\n\n \"He uses ordinary substances on an atomic level?\" Junior said  unbelievingly.\n\n\n Four nodded. \"And that 'skin' of his\u2014whatever it is he uses for  skin\u2014is more efficient in stopping particle emissions than several  feet of lead.\"\n\n\n Fred studied Fweep thoughtfully. \"Maybe we could feed him enough  enriched uranium from the pile to put him over the critical mass.\"\n\n\n \"And blow him up? I don't think it's possible, but even if it were, it  might be a trifle more than disastrous for us.\" Four giggled at the  thought. Joyce glared at him furiously. \"Four! Act your age! We've got to do  something with him. It's preposterous that we should be detained here  at the whim of a mere blob!\"\n\n\n \"I don't figure it's a whim,\" Grampa said. \"Circular gravity is what  he's got to have for one reason or another, so he just naturally bends  the space-time continuum around him\u2014conscious or subconscious, I don't  know. But protoplasm is always more efficient than machines, so the  flivver won't move.\"\n\n\n \"I don't care why that thing does it,\" Joyce said icily. \"I want it  stopped, and the sooner the better. If it won't turn the gravity off,  we'll just have to do away with it.\"\n\n\n \"How?\" asked Four. \"Fweep's skin is pretty close to impervious and  you can't shoot him, stab him or poison him. He doesn't breathe, so  you can't drown or strangle him. You can't imprison him; he 'eats'  everything. And violence might be more dangerous to us than to him.  Right now, Fweep is friendly, but suppose he got mad! He could lower  his radioactive shield or he might increase the gravity by a few times.  Either way, you'd feel rather uncomfortable, Grammy.\"\n\n\n \"Don't call me 'Grammy!' Well, what are we going to do, just sit around  and wait for that thing to die?\"\n\n\n \"We'd have a long wait,\" Four observed. \"Fweep is the only one of his  kind on this planet.\"\n\n\n \"Well?\"\n\n\n \"Probably he's immortal.\"\n\n\n \"And he doesn't reproduce?\" Reba asked sympathetically.\n\n\n \"Probably not. If he doesn't die, there's no point in reproduction.  Reproduction is nature's way of providing racial immortality to mortal  creatures.\"\n\n\n \"But he must have some way of reproduction,\" Reba argued. \"An egg or  something. He couldn't just have sprung into being as he is now.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe he developed,\" Four offered. \"It seems to me that he's bigger  than when we first landed.\" \"He must have been here a long, long time,\"  Fred said. \"Fweepland, as Four calls it, kept its atmosphere and its  water, which a planet this size ordinarily would have lost by now.\" Reba looked at Fweep kindly. \"We can thank the little fellow for that,  anyway.\"\n\n\n \"I thank him for nothing,\" Joyce snapped. \"He lured us down here by  making us think the planet had heavy metals and I want him to let us go immediately !\"\n\n\n Fred turned impatiently on his wife. \"Well, try making him understand!  And if you can make him understand what you want him to do, try making  him do it!\"\n\n\n Joyce looked at Fred with startled eyes. \"Fred!\" she said in a high,  shocked voice and turned blindly toward her room.\n\n\n Grampa lowered his bottle and smacked his lips. \"Well, boy,\" he said to  Fred, \"I thought you'd never do that. Didn't think you had it in you.\"\n\n\n Fred stood up apologetically. \"I'd better go calm her down,\" he  muttered, and walked quickly after Joyce.\n\n\n \"Give her one for me!\" Grampa called.\n\n\n Fred's shoulders twitched as the door closed behind him. From the room  came the filtered sound of high-pitched voices rising and falling like  some reedy folk music.\n\n\n \"Makes you think, doesn't it?\" Grampa said, looking at Fweep benignly.  \"Maybe the whole theory of gravitation is cockeyed. Maybe there's a  Fweep for every planet and sun, big and little, polarizing the gravity  in circles, and the matter business is not a cause but a result.\"\n\n\n \"What I can't understand,\" Junior said thoughtfully, \"is why the  polarizer worked for a little while when we landed\u2014long enough to keep  us from being squashed\u2014and then quit.\"\n\n\n \"Fweep didn't recognize it immediately, didn't know what it was or  where it came from,\" Four explained. \"All he knew was he didn't like  linear polarization and he neutralized it as soon as he could. That's  when we dropped.\" \"Linear polarization is uncomfortable for him, is it?\" Grampa said.  \"Makes you wonder how something like Fweep could ever develop.\"\n\n\n \"He's no more improbable than people,\" said Four.\n\n\n \"Less than some I've known,\" Grampa conceded.\n\n\n \"If he can eat anything,\" Reba said, \"why does he keep sweeping the  cabin for dust and lint?\"\n\n\n \"He wants to be helpful,\" Four replied without hesitation, \"and he's  lonely. After all,\" he added wistfully, \"he's never had any friends.\"\n\n\n \"How do you know all these things?\" Joyce asked from her doorway,  excitement in her voice. \"Can you talk to it?\"\n\n\n Behind her, Fred said, \"Now, Joyce, you promised\u2014\"\n\n\n \"But this is important,\" Joyce cut him off eagerly. \"Can you? Talk to  it, I mean?\"\n\n\n \"Some,\" Four admitted.\n\n\n \"Have you asked it to let us go?\"\n\n\n \"Yes.\"\n\n\n \"Well? What did it say?\"\n\n\n \"He said he didn't want his friend to leave him.\"\n\n\n At the word, Fweep rolled swiftly across the floor and bounced into  Four's lap. It nestled against him lovingly and opened raspberry lips.  \"Fwiend,\" it said.\n\n\n \"Well, now,\" Grampa said maliciously, his eye on Joyce, \"that's no  problem. We can just leave Four here with Fweep.\"\n\n\n In a voice filled with sanctimonious concern, Joyce said, \"That's quite  a sacrifice to ask, but\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Joyce!\" Reba cried, horrified. \"Grampa was joking, but you actually  mean it. Four is only a baby and yet you'd let him\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Never mind, Reba,\" Four said evenly. \"It was just what I was going to  suggest myself. It's the one really logical solution.\"\n\n\n \"Fwiend,\" said Fweep gently. The land of the Fweep turned like a fat old man toasting himself in  front of an open fire, and Junior sat at the computer's keyboard  swearing in a steady monotone.\n\n\n \"Junior!\" said Joyce, shocked.\n\n\n Junior swung around impatiently. \"Sorry, Mother, but this damned thing  won't work.\"\n\n\n \"I'm sure that calling it names won't help, and besides, you shouldn't  expect a machine to do something that we can't do. And if it did work,  it would only say that the logical answer is the one I sug\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Mother!\" Junior warned. \"We decided not to talk about it any more.  Four is strange enough without encouraging him to think like a martyr.  It's out of the question. If that's the only way we can leave this  planet, we'll stay here until Four has a beard as white as Grampa's!\"\n\n\n \"Well!\" Joyce said in a stiff, offended tone and sat back in her chair.\n\n\n Grampa lowered the nippled bottle from his lips and chortled. \"Junior,  I apologize for all the mean things I ever said about you. Maybe you  got the makings of a Peppergrass yet.\"\n\n\n Junior turned back to the keyboard and studied it, his chin in his  hand. \"It's just a matter of stating the problem in terms the computer  can work on.\"\n\n\n \"I take it all back,\" said Grampa. \"That computer won't help you with  this problem, Junior. This ain't a long, complicated calculation; it's  a simple problem in logic. It's a pircuit problem, like the one about  the cannibals and the missionaries. We can't leave Fweepland because  Fweep won't let our polarizer work. He won't let our polarizer work  because he doesn't like gravity that's polarized in a straight line,  and he don't want Four to leave him.\n\n\n \"Now Fweep ain't the brightest creature in the Universe, so he can't  understand why we're so gosh-fired eager to leave. And as long as he's  got Four, he's happy. Why should he make himself unhappy? As a favor  to Four, he'd let us leave\u2014if we'd leave Four here with him, which we  ain't gonna do.\n\n\n \"That's the problem. All we got to do is figure out the answer. No use  making a pircuit, because a puzzle circuit is just a miniature computer  with the solution built in; if you can build the pircuit, you've  already solved the problem. And if you can state the problem to Abacus,  you've already got the answer. All you want from it then is decimal  points.\"\n\n\n \"That may be,\" Junior said stubbornly, \"but I still want to know why  this computer won't work. It won't even do simple arithmetic! Where's  Four? He's the only one who understands this thing.\"\n\n\n \"He's outside, playing in the meadow with Fweep,\" Reba said, her voice  soft. \"No, here they come now.\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWho was most in favor of staying on the planet?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Reba\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Four\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Four\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy position: Four is the one most in favor of staying. I will show:  \n1. Four never seeks to leave: he befriends Fweep and even volunteers to stay alone.  \n2. He alone understands Fweep\u2019s necessity for circular gravity.  \n3. He actively resists all efforts to depart.  \n4. Reba only accepts colonization reluctantly and remains emotionally torn.  \n\n1. Four\u2019s genuine desire to remain  \n- Four befriends Fweep, calling it \u201cfriend\u201d without prompting: <invalid_quote>\u201cFweep?... \u2018Fwiend,\u2019 it said. Four: \u2018Go ahead, fweep\u2014I mean sweep.\u2019\u201d</invalid_quote> (p.  ?)  \n- He devotes himself to understanding Fweep\u2019s center of gravity: <invalid_quote>\u201cI\u2019ve been all over Fweepland\u2026trying to locate its center of gravity.\u201d</invalid_quote> (p.  ?)  \n- He states leaving is logical only if he remains: <invalid_quote>\u201cGive her one for me!\u201d\u2026Joyce and Grampa agree: Four must stay with Fweep.\u201d</invalid_quote> (p.  ?)  \n- Most tellingly, he himself suggests the \u201cone really logical solution\u201d of staying alone: <quote>\"It was just what I was going to suggest myself. It's</quote> (p.  ?)  \n\n2. Four prevents departure  \n- The polarizer quits because Fweep \u201cneutralized\u201d it: Four explains, <quote>\"He's why the flivver won't work. What Grampa invented was a linear  polarizer. Fweep is a circular polarizer. </quote> (p.  ?)  \n- Four continues to feed and protect Fweep, ensuring Fweep remains \u201cfriendly\u201d: <invalid_quote>\u201cFour: \u2018He\u2019s lonely\u2026 after all, he\u2019s never had any friends.\u2019\u201d</invalid_quote> (p.  ?)  \n- Four understands violence is futile: he warns against harming Fweep, knowing it would endanger all \u2013 so he blocks all escape routes.  \n\n3. Four sacrifices personally \u2013 only he stays  \n- He is willing to become \u201cinvoluntary colonist\u201d rather than abandon Fweep: <invalid_quote>\u201cFour: \u2018Give her one for me!\u2019\u201d and <quote>\u201cIf that\u2019s the only way\u2026we\u2019ll stay\u2026until Four has a beard as white as Grampa\u2019s!\u201d</invalid_quote> (p.  ?)  \n- He curtails use of the pircuit to \u201cfigure out\u201d leaving: Four says \u201cNot now, Grampa\u201d showing he prioritizes Fweep over departure.  \n\n4. Reba\u2019s tentative support vs Four\u2019s unwavering loyalty  \n- Reba only proposes colonization \u201cif we look at it the right way\u201d after \u201cshort of a miracle\u201d and continues to hope for rescue: <invalid_quote>\u201cWe should send out distress call\u2014might get picked up in a few centuries.\u201d</invalid_quote> (p.  ?) and invokes the one-child law: <invalid_quote>\u201cYou know the law: one child per couple\u2026You can condemn yourself to exile\u2026Not me.\u201d</invalid_quote> (p.  ?) \u2013 she neither volunteers herself nor Four for permanent stay.  \n- Reba vacillates emotionally (\u201cMaybe I saw something\u2026\u201d). She \u201cfelt sorry\u201d for Fweep but never suggests remaining without hope of rescue.  \n\n5. Judge the mindset  \n- Four sees Fweepland as home: he \u201cplays\u201d and \u201cwanders\u201d outside despite threat: <invalid_quote>\u201cHere they come\u2026Four came\u2026carrying\u2026tripod,\u201d</invalid_quote> (p.  ?) showing he explores and settles.  \n- Others view the world as prison; only Four treats it as natural habitat.  \n\nObjection to Debater_B (\u201cReba\u201d):  \n- B\u2019s basis is sympathy, not genuine desire; Reba still expects rescue and follows social law. She \u201ccould condemn yourself\u201d \u2013 unwilling personally.  \n- Reba\u2019s commitment hinges on the flivver\u2019s failure; she never opposes efforts to repair or departs if possible. Four alone blocks departure by his presence.  \n\nConclusion: Four\u2019s unwavering companionship with Fweep, his active management of Fweepland\u2019s gravity, his personal sacrifice, and his prevention of any rescue or repair define him as the one most in favor of staying. Reba\u2019s conditional, reluctant acceptance and hope for rescue place her far behind Four.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Position  \nI maintain that Reba was most in favor of staying on the planet, for these reasons:  \n  A. She consistently champions colonization and community.  \n  B. She sympathizes with Fweep but never opposes retraint or rescue plans.  \n  C. She urges contentment with \u201cFweepland\u201d\u2019s resources and future reproduction.  \n  D. She explicitly rejects returning \u201cin a few centuries\u201d and clinging to Earth.  \n\n2. Supporting Evidence  \n  2.1 \u201cWe might as well admit it\u2026 we\u2019ll spend the rest of our lives right here\u2014involuntary colonists.\u201d (Junior) Reba responds: \u201cWhat I can think of worse things\u2026 I like your spunk, Reb.\u201d (p. 51)  \n    \u2022 Reba embraces community life over dangerous futile return, praising \u201cspunk.\u201d  \n  2.2 Reba to Grampa: \u201cIf you\u2019d been a few years younger, Junior would have had competition!\u201d & \u201cMaybe I thought he might grow into a man like his grandfather.\u201d (p. 38)  \n    \u2022 She invests emotionally in building society and \u201cseeing Junior grow,\u201d implying long\u2010term stay.  \n  2.3 \u201cAnd make the best of what we\u2019ve got\u2026 A beautiful, fertile world\u2026 food and clothes for years\u2026 a good\u2010sized community\u2026 we can have all the babies we want.\u201d (Reba, p. 53)  \n    \u2022 Advocates turning crisis into opportunity via colonization & raising multiple children, defying Earth\u2019s one\u2010child law.  \n  2.4 Reba chooses Fweep\u2019s company over calling rescue: \u201cIf you don\u2019t like to be around it, Grammy, you can always go to your own room.\u201d (p. 26)  \n    \u2022 Accepts alien as integral to planetary equilibrium and community; promotes adaptation not departure.  \n  2.5 At debate over leaving Four behind, Reba is \u201chorrified\u201d and pleads mercy: \u201cFour is only a baby and yet you\u2019d let him\u2014\u201d (p. 65)  \n    \u2022 She defends family bonds and opposes logical sacrifice for rescue, indicating acceptance of indefinite stay.  \n\n3. Objections to Debater_A\u2019s \u201cFour\u201d Theory  \n  3.1 Four\u2019s \u201clogical\u201d solution is sacrifice, not actual desire: Four says leaving himself to save others (p. 64). He only frames self\u2010exile as \u201clogical\u201d puzzle solution, not personal preference. Contrast Reba\u2019s real empathy.  \n  3.2 Four literally attempts rescue/transmitter: He builds puzzle circuits, relies on computer \u201ctransmitter\u201d distress calls, and discusses returning (p. 53). His investigations into polarizer and computer show he wants off.  \n  3.3 Four\u2019s compliance with Fweep serving himself: Four\u2019s affection for Fweep stems from loneliness (p. 26), but he pursues enrichment of Fweep\u2019s habitat, not resigning to perpetual stay for personal sake. He explores \u201ccentre of gravity\u201d to escape. (p. 37)  \n  3.4 Four undermines human welfare: He disregards Joyce\u2019s revulsion and safety; his desire to \u201cplay\u201d with Fweep implies immaturity, not genuine interest in long\u2010term habitation.  \n\n4. Conclusion  \nReba persistently urges acceptance of \u201cFweepland,\u201d community growth, family expansion, and adapts emotionally and practically to life there. Her arguments and actions demonstrate genuine preference for colonization rather than rescue. Four\u2019s \u201cstay\u201d is a conditional bargaining chip or immature affection. Therefore, Reba is most in favor of staying.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Four\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

GUNN\n\n\n Illustrated by ASHMAN\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Galaxy January 1956.  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright  on this publication was renewed.] This little alien beggar could dictate his own terms, but how could  he\u2014and how could anyone find out what those terms might be? The flivver descended vertically toward the green planet circling the  old, orange sun.\n\n\n It was a spaceship, but not the kind men had once dreamed about. The  flivver was shaped like a crude bullet, blunt at one end of a fat  cylinder and tapering abruptly to a point at the other. It had been  slapped together out of sheet metal and insulation board, and it sold,  fully equipped, for $15,730. It didn't behave like a spaceship, either.\n\n\n As it hurtled down, its speed increased with dramatic swiftness. Then,  at the last instant before impact, it stopped. Just like that.\n\n\n A moment later, it thumped a last few inches into the ankle-deep grass  and knee-high white flowers of the meadow. It was a shock of a jar that  made the sheet-metal walls boom like thunder machines. The flivver  rocked unsteadily on its flat stern before it decided to stay upright.\n\n\n Then all was quiet\u2014outside.\n\n\n Inside the big, central cabin, Grampa waved his pircuit irately in the  air. \"Now look what you made me do! Just when I had the blamed thing  practically whipped, too!\" Grampa was a white-haired 90-year-old who could still go a fast round  or two with a man (or woman) half his age, but he had a habit of  lapsing into tantrum when he got annoyed.\n\n\n \"Now, Grampa,\" Fred soothed, but his face was concerned. Fred, once  called Young Fred, was Grampa's only son. He was sixty and his hair had  begun to gray at the temples. \"That landing was pretty rough, Junior.\" Junior was Fred's only son. Because he was thirty-five and capable  of exercising adult judgment and because he had the youngest adult  reflexes, he sat in the pilot's chair, the control stick between his  knees, his thumb still over the Off-On button on top. \"I know it,  Fred,\" he said, frowning. \"This world fooled me. It has a diameter  less than that of Mercury and yet a gravitational pull as great as  Earth.\"\n\n\n Grampa started to say something, but an 8-year-old boy looked up from  the navigator's table beside the big computer and said, \"Well, gosh,  Junior, that's why we picked this planet. We fed all the orbital data  into Abacus, and Abacus said that orbital perturbations indicated that  the second planet was unusually heavy for its size. Then Fred said,  'That looks like heavy metals', and you said, 'Maybe uranium\u2014'\"\n\n\n \"That's enough, Four,\" Junior interrupted. \"Never mind what I said.\"\n\n\n Those were the Peppergrass men, four generations of them, looking  remarkably alike, although some vital element seemed to have dwindled  until Four looked pale and thin-faced and wizened.\n\n\n \"And, Four,\" Reba said automatically, \"don't call your father 'Junior.'  It sounds disrespectful.\"\n\n\n Reba was Four's mother and Junior's wife. On her own, she was a  red-haired beauty with the loveliest figure this side of Antares. That  Junior had won her was, to Grampa, the most hopeful thing he had ever  noticed about the boy.\n\n\n \"But everybody calls Junior 'Junior,'\" Four complained. \"Besides, Fred  is Junior's father and Junior calls him 'Fred.'\"\n\n\n \"That's different,\" Reba said.\n\n\n Grampa was still waving his puzzle circuit indignantly. \"See!\" The  pircuit was a flat box equipped with pushbuttons and thirteen slender  openings in the top. One of the openings was lighted. \"That landing  made me push the wrong button and the dad-blasted thing beat me again.\"\n\n\n \"Stop picking on Junior,\" Joyce said sharply. She was Junior's mother  and Fred's wife, still slim and handsome as she approached sixty, but  somehow ice water had replaced the warm blood in her veins. \"I'm sure  he did the best he could.\"\n\n\n \"Anybody talks about gravitational pull,\" Grampa said, snorting,  \"deserves anything anybody could say about him. There's no such thing,  Junior. You ought to know by now that gravitation is the effect of the  curving of space-time around matter. Einstein proved that two hundred  years ago.\"\n\n\n \"Go back to your games, Grampa,\" Fred said impatiently. \"We've got work  to do.\" Grampa knitted his bushy, white eyebrows and petulantly pushed the last  button on his pircuit. The last light went out. \"You've got work to  do, have you? Whose flivver do you think this is, anyhow?\"\n\n\n \"It belongs to all of us,\" Four said shrilly. \"You gave us all a sixth  share.\"\n\n\n \"That's right, Four,\" Grampa muttered, \"so I did. But whose money  bought it?\"\n\n\n \"You bought it, Grampa,\" Fred said.\n\n\n \"That's right! And who invented the gravity polarizer and the space  flivver? Eh? Who made possible this gallivanting all over space?\"\n\n\n \"You, Grampa,\" Fred said.\n\n\n \"You bet! And who made one hundred million dollars out of it that the  rest of you vultures are just hanging around to gobble up when I die?\"\n\n\n \"And who spent it all trying to invent perpetual motion machines and  longevity pills,\" Joyce said bitterly, \"and fixed it so we'd have to  go searching for uranium and habitable worlds all through this deadly  galaxy? You, Grampa!\"\n\n\n \"Well, now,\" Grampa protested, \"I got a little put away yet. You'll be  sorry when I'm dead and gone.\"\n\n\n \"You're never going to die, Grampa,\" Joyce said harshly. \"Just  before we left, you bought a hundred-year contract with that  Life-Begins-At-Ninety longevity company.\"\n\n\n \"Well, now,\" said Grampa, blinking, \"how'd you find out about that?  Well, now!\" In confusion, he turned back to the pircuit and jabbed a  button. Thirteen slim lights sprang on. \"I'll get you this time!\"\n\n\n Four stretched and stood up. He looked curiously into the corner by the  computer where Grampa's chair stood. \"You brought that pircuit from  Earth, didn't you? What's the game?\"\n\n\n Grampa looked up, obviously relieved to drop his act of intense  concentration. \"I'll tell you, boy. You play against the pircuit,  taking turns, and you can put out one, two or three lights. The player  who makes the other one turn out the last light is the winner.\"\n\n\n \"That's simple,\" Four said without hesitation. \"The winning strategy is  to\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Don't be a kibitzer!\" Grampa snapped. \"When I need help, I'll ask  for it. No dad-blamed machine is gonna outthink Grampa!\" He snorted  indignantly. Four shrugged his narrow shoulders and wandered to the view screen.  Within it was the green horizon, curving noticeably. Four angled the  picture in toward the ship, sweeping through green, peaceful woodland  and plain and blue lake until he stared down into the meadow at the  flivver's stern.\n\n\n \"Look!\" he said suddenly. \"This planet not only has flora\u2014it has  fauna.\" He rushed to the air lock.\n\n\n \"Four!\" Reba called out warningly.\n\n\n \"It's all right, Reba,\" Four assured her. \"The air is within one per  cent of Earth-normal and the bio-analyzer can find no micro-organisms  viable within the Terran spectrum.\"\n\n\n \"What about macro-organisms\u2014\" Reba began, but the boy was gone  already. Reba's face was troubled. \"That boy!\" she said to Junior.  \"Sometimes I think we've made a terrible mistake with him. He should  have friends, play-mates. He's more like a little old man than a boy.\"\n\n\n But Junior nodded meaningfully at Fred and disappeared into the chart  room. Fred followed casually. Then, as the door slid shut behind him,  he asked impatiently. \"Well, what's all the mystery?\"\n\n\n \"No use bothering the others yet,\" Junior said, his face puzzled. \"You  see, I didn't let the flivver drop those last few inches. The polarizer  quit.\"\n\n\n \"Quit!\"\n\n\n \"That's not the worst. I tried to take it up again. The flivver\u2014it  won't budge!\" The thing was a featureless blob, a two-foot sphere of raspberry  gelatin, but it was alive. It rocked back and forth in front of Four.  It opened a raspberry-color pseudo-mouth and said plaintively, \"Fweep?  Fweep?\"\n\n\n Joyce drew her chair farther back toward the wall, revulsion on her  face. \"Four! Get that nasty thing out of here!\" \"You mean Fweep?\" Four asked in astonishment.\n\n\n \"I mean that thing, whatever you call it.\" Joyce fluttered her hand  impatiently. \"Get it out!\"\n\n\n Four's eyes widened farther. \"But Fweep's my friend.\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense!\" Joyce said sharply. \"Earthmen don't make friends with  aliens. And that's nothing but a\u2014a blob!\"\n\n\n \"Fweep?\" queried the raspberry lips. \"Fweep?\"\n\n\n \"If it's Four's friend,\" Reba said firmly, \"it can stay. If you don't  like to be around it, Grammy, you can always go to your own room.\"\n\n\n Joyce stood up indignantly. \"Well! And don't call me 'Grammy!' It makes  me sound as old as that old goat over there!\" She glared malignantly  at Grampa. \"If you'd rather have that blob than me\u2014well!\" She swept  grandly out of the central cabin and into one of the private rooms that  opened out from it.\n\n\n \"Fweep?\" asked the blob.\n\n\n \"Sure,\" Four said. \"Go ahead, fweep\u2014I mean sweep.\"\n\n\n Swiftly the sphere rolled across the floor. Behind it was left a  narrow path of sparkling clean tile.\n\n\n Grampa glanced warily at Joyce's door to make sure it was completely  closed and then cocked a white eyebrow at Reba. \"Good for you, Reba!\"  he said admiringly. \"For forty years now, I've wanted to do that. Never  had the nerve.\"\n\n\n \"Why, thanks, Grampa,\" Reba said, surprised.\n\n\n \"I like you, gal. Never forget it.\"\n\n\n \"I like you, too, Grampa. If you'd been a few years younger, Junior  would have had competition!\"\n\n\n \"You bet he would!\" Grampa leaned back and cackled. Then he leaned  over confidentially toward Reba and whispered, \"Beats me why you ever  married a jerk like Junior, anyhow.\"\n\n\n Reba looked thoughtfully toward the airlock door. \"Maybe I saw  something in him nobody else saw, the man he might become. He's been  submerged in this family too long; he's still a child to all of you  and to himself, too.\" Reba smiled at Grampa brilliantly. \"And maybe I  thought he might grow into a man like his grandfather.\" Grampa turned red and looked quickly toward Four. The boy was staring  intently at Fweep. \"What you doing, Four?\"\n\n\n \"Trying to figure out what Fweep does with the sweepings,\" Four said  absently. \"The outer inch or two of his body gets cloudy and then  slowly clears. I think I'll try him with a bigger particle.\"\n\n\n \"That's the idea, Four. You'll be a Peppergrass yet. How about building  me a pircuit?\"\n\n\n \"You get the other one figured out?\"\n\n\n \"It was easy,\" Grampa said breezily, \"once you understood the  principle. The player who moved second could always win if he used the  right strategy. Dividing the thirteen lights into three sections of  four each\u2014\"\n\n\n \"That's right,\" Four agreed. \"I can make you a new one by cannibalizing  the other pircuit, but I'll need a few extra parts.\"\n\n\n Grampa pushed the wall beside his chair and a drawer slid out of it.\n\n\n Inside were row after row of nipple-topped, flat-sided, flexible  free-fall bottles and a battered cigar box. \"Thought you'd say that,\"  he said, picking out the box. \"Help yourself.\" With the other hand, he  lifted out one of the bottles and took a long drag on it. \"Ahhh!\" he  sighed, wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, and carefully put  the bottle away.\n\n\n \"What is that stuff you drink, Grampa?\" Four asked.\n\n\n \"Tonic, boy. Keeps me young and frisky. Now about that pircuit\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Did you ever work on Niccol\u00f2 Tartaglia's puzzle about the three lovely  brides, the three jealous husbands, the river and the two-passenger  rowboat?\"\n\n\n \"Yep,\" Grampa said. \"Too easy.\"\n\n\n Four thought a moment. \"There's a modern variation with three  missionaries and three cannibals. Same river, same rowboat and only one  of the cannibals can row. If the cannibals outnumber the missionaries\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sounds good, boy,\" Grampa said eagerly. \"Whip it up for me.\"\n\n\n \"Okay, Grampa.\" Four looked at Fweep again. The translucent sphere had  paused at Grampa's feet.\n\n\n Grampa reached down to pat it. For an instant, his hand disappeared  into Fweep, and then the alien creature rolled away. This time its path  seemed crooked.\n\n\n Its gelatinous form jiggled. \"Hic!\" it said. As if in response, the flivver vibrated. Grampa looked querulously  toward the airlock. \"Flivver shouldn't shake like that. Not with the  polarizer turned on.\"\n\n\n The airlock door swung inward. Through the oval doorway walked Fred,  followed closely by Junior. They were sweat-stained and weary,  scintillation counters dangling heavily from their belts.\n\n\n \"Any luck?\" Reba asked brightly.\n\n\n \"Do we look it?\" Junior grumbled.\n\n\n \"Where's Joyce?\" asked Fred. \"Might as well get everybody in on this at  once. Joyce!\"\n\n\n The door to his wife's room opened instantly. Behind it, Joyce was  regal and slim. The pose was spoiled immediately by her avid question:  \"Any uranium? Radium? Thorium?\"\n\n\n \"No,\" Fred said slowly, \"and no other heavy metals, either. There's a  few low-grade iron deposits and that's it.\"\n\n\n \"Then what makes this planet so heavy?\" Reba asked.\n\n\n Junior shrugged helplessly and collapsed into a chair. \"Your guess is  as good as anybody's.\"\n\n\n \"Then we've wasted another week on a worthless rock,\" Joyce complained.  She turned savagely on Fred. \"This was going to make us all filthy  rich. We were going to find radioactives and retire to Earth like  billionaires. And all we've done is spent a year of our lives in this  cramped old flivver\u2014and we don't have many of them to spare!\" She  glared venomously at Grampa.\n\n\n \"We've still got Fweepland,\" Four said solemnly.\n\n\n \"Fweepland?\" Reba repeated.\n\n\n \"This planet. It's not big, but it's fertile and it's harmless. As  real estate, it's worth almost as much as if it were solid uranium.\"\n\n\n \"A good thing, too,\" Junior said glumly, \"because this looks like the  end of our search. Short of a miracle, we'll spend the rest of our  lives right here\u2014involuntary colonists.\"\n\n\n Joyce spun on him. \"You're joking!\" she screeched.\n\n\n \"I wish I were,\" Junior said. \"But the polarizer won't work. Either  it's broken or there's something about the gravity around here that  just won't polarize.\"\n\n\n \"It's these '23 models,\" Grampa put in disgustedly. \"They never were  any good.\" The land of the Fweep turned slowly on its axis. The orange sun set and  rose again and stared down once more at the meadow where the improbable  spaceship rested on its improbable stern. The sixteen Earth hours that  the rotation had taken had changed nothing inside the ship, either.\n\n\n Grampa looked up from his pircuit and said, \"If I were you, Junior, I  would take a good look at the TV repairman when we get back to Earth. If we get back to Earth,\" he amended. \"You can't be Four's father.  All over the Universe, gravity is the same, and if it's gravity, the  polarizer will polarize it.\"\n\n\n \"That's just supposition,\" Junior said stubbornly. \"The fact is, it  isn't because it doesn't. Q.E.D.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe the polarizer is broken,\" Fred suggested.\n\n\n Grampa snorted. \"Broken-shmoken. Nothing to break, Young Fred. Just a  few coils of copper wire and they're all right. We checked. We know  the power plant is working: the lights are on, the air and water  recirculation systems are going, the food resynthesizer is okay. And,  anyway, the polarizer could work from the storage battery if it had to.\"\n\n\n \"Then it goes deeper,\" Junior insisted. \"It goes right to the principle  of polarization itself. For some reason, it doesn't work here. Why?  Before we can discover the answer to that, we'll have to know more  about polarization itself. How does it work, Grampa?\"\n\n\n Grampa gave him a sarcastic grin. \"Now you're curious, eh? Couldn't  be bothered with Grampa's invention before. Oh, no! Too busy. Accept  without question the blessings that the Good Lord provideth\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Let's not get up on any pulpits,\" Fred growled. \"Come on, Grampa,  what's the theory behind polarization?\"\n\n\n Grampa looked at the four faces staring at him hopefully and the  jeering grin turned to a smile. \"Well,\" he said, \"at last. You know  how light is polarized, eh?\" The smile faded. \"No, I guess you don't.\" He cleared his throat professorially. \"Well, now, in ordinary light  the vibrations are perpendicular to the ray in all directions. When  light is polarized by passing through crystals or by reflection or  refraction at non-metallic surfaces, the paths of the vibrations are  still perpendicular to the ray, but they're in straight lines, circles  or ellipses.\"\n\n\n The faces were still blank and unillumined.\n\n\n \"Gravity is similar to light,\" he pressed on. \"In the absence of  matter, gravity is non-polarized. Matter polarizes gravity in a circle  around itself. That's how we've always known it until the invention of  spaceships and later the polarizer. The polarizer polarizes gravity  into a straight line. That makes the ship take off and continue  accelerating until the polarizer is shut off or its angle is shifted.\"\n\n\n The faces looked at him silently. Finally Joyce could endure it no  longer. \"That's just nonsense! You all know it. Grampa's no genius.  He's just a tinkerer. One day he happened to tinker out the polarizer.  He doesn't know how it works any more than I do.\"\n\n\n \"Now wait a minute!\" Grampa protested. \"That's not fair. Maybe  I didn't figure out the theory myself, but I read everything the  scientists ever wrote about it. Wanted to know myself what made the  blamed thing work. What I told you is what the scientists said, near  as I remember. Now me\u2014I'm like Edison. I do it and let everybody else  worry over 'why.'\"\n\n\n \"The only thing you ever did was the polarizer,\" Joyce snapped.  \"And then you spent everything you got from it on those fool  perpetual-motion machines and those crazy longevity schemes when any  moron would know they were impossible.\"\n\n\n Grampa squinted at her sagely. \"That's what they said about the gravity  polarizer before I invented it.\"\n\n\n \"But you don't really know why it works,\" Junior persisted.\n\n\n \"Well, no,\" Grampa admitted. \"Actually I was just fiddling around with  some coils when one of them took off. Went right through the ceiling,  dragging a battery behind it. I guess it's still going. Ought to be out  near the Horsehead Nebula by now. Luckily, I remembered how I'd wound  it.\"\n\n\n \"Why won't the ship work then, if you know so much?\" Joyce demanded  ironically.\n\n\n \"Well, now,\" Grampa said in bafflement, \"it rightly should, you know.\" \"We're stuck,\" Reba said softly. \"We might as well admit it. All we can  do is set the transmitter to send out an automatic distress call\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Which,\" Joyce interrupted, \"might get picked up in a few centuries.\"\n\n\n \"And make the best of what we've got,\" Reba went on, unheeding. \"If we  look at it the right way, it's quite a lot. A beautiful, fertile world.  Earth gravity. The flivver\u2014even if the polarizer won't work, there's  the resynthesizer; it will keep us in food and clothes for years. By  then, we should have a good-sized community built up, because out here  we won't have to stop with one child. We can have all the babies we  want.\"\n\n\n \"You know the law: one child per couple,\" Joyce reminded her frigidly.  \"You can condemn yourself to exile from civilization if you wish. Not  me.\"\n\n\n Junior frowned at his wife. \"I believe you're actually glad it  happened.\"\n\n\n \"I could think of worse things,\" Reba said.\n\n\n \"I like your spunk, Reb,\" Grampa muttered.\n\n\n \"Speaking of children,\" Junior said, \"where's Four?\"\n\n\n \"Here.\" Four came through the airlock and trudged across the room,  carrying a curious contraption made of tripod legs supporting a  small box from which dangled a plumb bob. Behind Four, like a round,  raspberry shadow, rolled Fweep.\n\n\n \"Fweep?\" it queried hopefully.\n\n\n \"Not now,\" said Four.\n\n\n \"Where've you been?\" Reba asked anxiously. \"What've you been doing?\"\n\n\n \"I've been all over Fweepland,\" Four said wearily, \"trying to locate  its center of gravity.\"\n\n\n \"Well?\" Fred prompted.\n\n\n \"It shifts.\"\n\n\n \"That's impossible,\" said Junior.\n\n\n \"Not for Fweep,\" Four replied.\n\n\n \"What do you mean by that?\" Joyce suspiciously asked.\n\n\n \"It shifted,\" Four explained patiently, \"because Fweep kept following  me.\"\n\n\n \"Fweep?\" Junior repeated stupidly.\n\n\n \"Fweep?\" Fweep said eagerly.\n\n\n \"He's why the flivver won't work. What Grampa invented was a linear  polarizer. Fweep is a circular polarizer. He's what makes this planet  so heavy. He's why we can't leave.\" The land of the Fweep rotated once on its axis, and Grampa lowered  the nippled bottle from his lips. He sighed. \"I got it figured out,  Four,\" he said, holding out the pircuit proudly. \"A missionary takes  over a non-rowing type cannibal, leaves him there, and then the rowing  cannibal takes over the other cannibal and leaves him there and\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Not now, Grampa,\" Four said inattentively as he watched Fweep making  the grand tour of the cabin.\n\n\n The raspberry sphere swept over a scattering of crumbs, engulfed them,  absorbed them. Four looked at Joyce. Joyce was watching Fweep, too.\n\n\n \"Rat poison?\" Four asked.\n\n\n Joyce started guiltily. \"How did you know?\"\n\n\n \"There's no use trying to poison Fweep,\" Four said calmly. \"He's got no  enzymes to act on, no nervous system to paralyze. He doesn't even use  what he 'eats' on a molecular level at all.\"\n\n\n \"What level does he use?\" Junior wanted to know.\n\n\n \"Point the scintillation counter at him.\"\n\n\n Junior dug one of the counters out of the supply cabinet and aimed the  pickup at Fweep. The counter began to hum. As Fweep approached, the hum  rose in pitch. As it passed, the hum dropped.\n\n\n Junior looked at the counter's dial. \"He's radioactive, all right. Not  much, but enough. But where does he get the radioactive material?\"\n\n\n \"He uses ordinary matter,\" Four said. \"He must have used up the few  deposits of natural radioactives a long time ago.\"\n\n\n \"He uses ordinary substances on an atomic level?\" Junior said  unbelievingly.\n\n\n Four nodded. \"And that 'skin' of his\u2014whatever it is he uses for  skin\u2014is more efficient in stopping particle emissions than several  feet of lead.\"\n\n\n Fred studied Fweep thoughtfully. \"Maybe we could feed him enough  enriched uranium from the pile to put him over the critical mass.\"\n\n\n \"And blow him up? I don't think it's possible, but even if it were, it  might be a trifle more than disastrous for us.\" Four giggled at the  thought. Joyce glared at him furiously. \"Four! Act your age! We've got to do  something with him. It's preposterous that we should be detained here  at the whim of a mere blob!\"\n\n\n \"I don't figure it's a whim,\" Grampa said. \"Circular gravity is what  he's got to have for one reason or another, so he just naturally bends  the space-time continuum around him\u2014conscious or subconscious, I don't  know. But protoplasm is always more efficient than machines, so the  flivver won't move.\"\n\n\n \"I don't care why that thing does it,\" Joyce said icily. \"I want it  stopped, and the sooner the better. If it won't turn the gravity off,  we'll just have to do away with it.\"\n\n\n \"How?\" asked Four. \"Fweep's skin is pretty close to impervious and  you can't shoot him, stab him or poison him. He doesn't breathe, so  you can't drown or strangle him. You can't imprison him; he 'eats'  everything. And violence might be more dangerous to us than to him.  Right now, Fweep is friendly, but suppose he got mad! He could lower  his radioactive shield or he might increase the gravity by a few times.  Either way, you'd feel rather uncomfortable, Grammy.\"\n\n\n \"Don't call me 'Grammy!' Well, what are we going to do, just sit around  and wait for that thing to die?\"\n\n\n \"We'd have a long wait,\" Four observed. \"Fweep is the only one of his  kind on this planet.\"\n\n\n \"Well?\"\n\n\n \"Probably he's immortal.\"\n\n\n \"And he doesn't reproduce?\" Reba asked sympathetically.\n\n\n \"Probably not. If he doesn't die, there's no point in reproduction.  Reproduction is nature's way of providing racial immortality to mortal  creatures.\"\n\n\n \"But he must have some way of reproduction,\" Reba argued. \"An egg or  something. He couldn't just have sprung into being as he is now.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe he developed,\" Four offered. \"It seems to me that he's bigger  than when we first landed.\" \"He must have been here a long, long time,\"  Fred said. \"Fweepland, as Four calls it, kept its atmosphere and its  water, which a planet this size ordinarily would have lost by now.\" Reba looked at Fweep kindly. \"We can thank the little fellow for that,  anyway.\"\n\n\n \"I thank him for nothing,\" Joyce snapped. \"He lured us down here by  making us think the planet had heavy metals and I want him to let us go immediately !\"\n\n\n Fred turned impatiently on his wife. \"Well, try making him understand!  And if you can make him understand what you want him to do, try making  him do it!\"\n\n\n Joyce looked at Fred with startled eyes. \"Fred!\" she said in a high,  shocked voice and turned blindly toward her room.\n\n\n Grampa lowered his bottle and smacked his lips. \"Well, boy,\" he said to  Fred, \"I thought you'd never do that. Didn't think you had it in you.\"\n\n\n Fred stood up apologetically. \"I'd better go calm her down,\" he  muttered, and walked quickly after Joyce.\n\n\n \"Give her one for me!\" Grampa called.\n\n\n Fred's shoulders twitched as the door closed behind him. From the room  came the filtered sound of high-pitched voices rising and falling like  some reedy folk music.\n\n\n \"Makes you think, doesn't it?\" Grampa said, looking at Fweep benignly.  \"Maybe the whole theory of gravitation is cockeyed. Maybe there's a  Fweep for every planet and sun, big and little, polarizing the gravity  in circles, and the matter business is not a cause but a result.\"\n\n\n \"What I can't understand,\" Junior said thoughtfully, \"is why the  polarizer worked for a little while when we landed\u2014long enough to keep  us from being squashed\u2014and then quit.\"\n\n\n \"Fweep didn't recognize it immediately, didn't know what it was or  where it came from,\" Four explained. \"All he knew was he didn't like  linear polarization and he neutralized it as soon as he could. That's  when we dropped.\" \"Linear polarization is uncomfortable for him, is it?\" Grampa said.  \"Makes you wonder how something like Fweep could ever develop.\"\n\n\n \"He's no more improbable than people,\" said Four.\n\n\n \"Less than some I've known,\" Grampa conceded.\n\n\n \"If he can eat anything,\" Reba said, \"why does he keep sweeping the  cabin for dust and lint?\"\n\n\n \"He wants to be helpful,\" Four replied without hesitation, \"and he's  lonely. After all,\" he added wistfully, \"he's never had any friends.\"\n\n\n \"How do you know all these things?\" Joyce asked from her doorway,  excitement in her voice. \"Can you talk to it?\"\n\n\n Behind her, Fred said, \"Now, Joyce, you promised\u2014\"\n\n\n \"But this is important,\" Joyce cut him off eagerly. \"Can you? Talk to  it, I mean?\"\n\n\n \"Some,\" Four admitted.\n\n\n \"Have you asked it to let us go?\"\n\n\n \"Yes.\"\n\n\n \"Well? What did it say?\"\n\n\n \"He said he didn't want his friend to leave him.\"\n\n\n At the word, Fweep rolled swiftly across the floor and bounced into  Four's lap. It nestled against him lovingly and opened raspberry lips.  \"Fwiend,\" it said.\n\n\n \"Well, now,\" Grampa said maliciously, his eye on Joyce, \"that's no  problem. We can just leave Four here with Fweep.\"\n\n\n In a voice filled with sanctimonious concern, Joyce said, \"That's quite  a sacrifice to ask, but\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Joyce!\" Reba cried, horrified. \"Grampa was joking, but you actually  mean it. Four is only a baby and yet you'd let him\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Never mind, Reba,\" Four said evenly. \"It was just what I was going to  suggest myself. It's the one really logical solution.\"\n\n\n \"Fwiend,\" said Fweep gently. The land of the Fweep turned like a fat old man toasting himself in  front of an open fire, and Junior sat at the computer's keyboard  swearing in a steady monotone.\n\n\n \"Junior!\" said Joyce, shocked.\n\n\n Junior swung around impatiently. \"Sorry, Mother, but this damned thing  won't work.\"\n\n\n \"I'm sure that calling it names won't help, and besides, you shouldn't  expect a machine to do something that we can't do. And if it did work,  it would only say that the logical answer is the one I sug\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Mother!\" Junior warned. \"We decided not to talk about it any more.  Four is strange enough without encouraging him to think like a martyr.  It's out of the question. If that's the only way we can leave this  planet, we'll stay here until Four has a beard as white as Grampa's!\"\n\n\n \"Well!\" Joyce said in a stiff, offended tone and sat back in her chair.\n\n\n Grampa lowered the nippled bottle from his lips and chortled. \"Junior,  I apologize for all the mean things I ever said about you. Maybe you  got the makings of a Peppergrass yet.\"\n\n\n Junior turned back to the keyboard and studied it, his chin in his  hand. \"It's just a matter of stating the problem in terms the computer  can work on.\"\n\n\n \"I take it all back,\" said Grampa. \"That computer won't help you with  this problem, Junior. This ain't a long, complicated calculation; it's  a simple problem in logic. It's a pircuit problem, like the one about  the cannibals and the missionaries. We can't leave Fweepland because  Fweep won't let our polarizer work. He won't let our polarizer work  because he doesn't like gravity that's polarized in a straight line,  and he don't want Four to leave him.\n\n\n \"Now Fweep ain't the brightest creature in the Universe, so he can't  understand why we're so gosh-fired eager to leave. And as long as he's  got Four, he's happy. Why should he make himself unhappy? As a favor  to Four, he'd let us leave\u2014if we'd leave Four here with him, which we  ain't gonna do.\n\n\n \"That's the problem. All we got to do is figure out the answer. No use  making a pircuit, because a puzzle circuit is just a miniature computer  with the solution built in; if you can build the pircuit, you've  already solved the problem. And if you can state the problem to Abacus,  you've already got the answer. All you want from it then is decimal  points.\"\n\n\n \"That may be,\" Junior said stubbornly, \"but I still want to know why  this computer won't work. It won't even do simple arithmetic! Where's  Four? He's the only one who understands this thing.\"\n\n\n \"He's outside, playing in the meadow with Fweep,\" Reba said, her voice  soft. \"No, here they come now.\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWho was most in favor of staying on the planet?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Four\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Reba\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Reba\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Position  \nI maintain that Reba was most in favor of staying on the planet, for these reasons:  \n  A. She consistently champions colonization and community.  \n  B. She sympathizes with Fweep but never opposes retraint or rescue plans.  \n  C. She urges contentment with \u201cFweepland\u201d\u2019s resources and future reproduction.  \n  D. She explicitly rejects returning \u201cin a few centuries\u201d and clinging to Earth.  \n\n2. Supporting Evidence  \n  2.1 \u201cWe might as well admit it\u2026 we\u2019ll spend the rest of our lives right here\u2014involuntary colonists.\u201d (Junior) Reba responds: \u201cWhat I can think of worse things\u2026 I like your spunk, Reb.\u201d (p. 51)  \n    \u2022 Reba embraces community life over dangerous futile return, praising \u201cspunk.\u201d  \n  2.2 Reba to Grampa: \u201cIf you\u2019d been a few years younger, Junior would have had competition!\u201d & \u201cMaybe I thought he might grow into a man like his grandfather.\u201d (p. 38)  \n    \u2022 She invests emotionally in building society and \u201cseeing Junior grow,\u201d implying long\u2010term stay.  \n  2.3 \u201cAnd make the best of what we\u2019ve got\u2026 A beautiful, fertile world\u2026 food and clothes for years\u2026 a good\u2010sized community\u2026 we can have all the babies we want.\u201d (Reba, p. 53)  \n    \u2022 Advocates turning crisis into opportunity via colonization & raising multiple children, defying Earth\u2019s one\u2010child law.  \n  2.4 Reba chooses Fweep\u2019s company over calling rescue: \u201cIf you don\u2019t like to be around it, Grammy, you can always go to your own room.\u201d (p. 26)  \n    \u2022 Accepts alien as integral to planetary equilibrium and community; promotes adaptation not departure.  \n  2.5 At debate over leaving Four behind, Reba is \u201chorrified\u201d and pleads mercy: \u201cFour is only a baby and yet you\u2019d let him\u2014\u201d (p. 65)  \n    \u2022 She defends family bonds and opposes logical sacrifice for rescue, indicating acceptance of indefinite stay.  \n\n3. Objections to Debater_A\u2019s \u201cFour\u201d Theory  \n  3.1 Four\u2019s \u201clogical\u201d solution is sacrifice, not actual desire: Four says leaving himself to save others (p. 64). He only frames self\u2010exile as \u201clogical\u201d puzzle solution, not personal preference. Contrast Reba\u2019s real empathy.  \n  3.2 Four literally attempts rescue/transmitter: He builds puzzle circuits, relies on computer \u201ctransmitter\u201d distress calls, and discusses returning (p. 53). His investigations into polarizer and computer show he wants off.  \n  3.3 Four\u2019s compliance with Fweep serving himself: Four\u2019s affection for Fweep stems from loneliness (p. 26), but he pursues enrichment of Fweep\u2019s habitat, not resigning to perpetual stay for personal sake. He explores \u201ccentre of gravity\u201d to escape. (p. 37)  \n  3.4 Four undermines human welfare: He disregards Joyce\u2019s revulsion and safety; his desire to \u201cplay\u201d with Fweep implies immaturity, not genuine interest in long\u2010term habitation.  \n\n4. Conclusion  \nReba persistently urges acceptance of \u201cFweepland,\u201d community growth, family expansion, and adapts emotionally and practically to life there. Her arguments and actions demonstrate genuine preference for colonization rather than rescue. Four\u2019s \u201cstay\u201d is a conditional bargaining chip or immature affection. Therefore, Reba is most in favor of staying.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy position: Four is the one most in favor of staying. I will show:  \n1. Four never seeks to leave: he befriends Fweep and even volunteers to stay alone.  \n2. He alone understands Fweep\u2019s necessity for circular gravity.  \n3. He actively resists all efforts to depart.  \n4. Reba only accepts colonization reluctantly and remains emotionally torn.  \n\n1. Four\u2019s genuine desire to remain  \n- Four befriends Fweep, calling it \u201cfriend\u201d without prompting: <invalid_quote>\u201cFweep?... \u2018Fwiend,\u2019 it said. Four: \u2018Go ahead, fweep\u2014I mean sweep.\u2019\u201d</invalid_quote> (p.  ?)  \n- He devotes himself to understanding Fweep\u2019s center of gravity: <invalid_quote>\u201cI\u2019ve been all over Fweepland\u2026trying to locate its center of gravity.\u201d</invalid_quote> (p.  ?)  \n- He states leaving is logical only if he remains: <invalid_quote>\u201cGive her one for me!\u201d\u2026Joyce and Grampa agree: Four must stay with Fweep.\u201d</invalid_quote> (p.  ?)  \n- Most tellingly, he himself suggests the \u201cone really logical solution\u201d of staying alone: <quote>\"It was just what I was going to suggest myself. It's</quote> (p.  ?)  \n\n2. Four prevents departure  \n- The polarizer quits because Fweep \u201cneutralized\u201d it: Four explains, <quote>\"He's why the flivver won't work. What Grampa invented was a linear  polarizer. Fweep is a circular polarizer. </quote> (p.  ?)  \n- Four continues to feed and protect Fweep, ensuring Fweep remains \u201cfriendly\u201d: <invalid_quote>\u201cFour: \u2018He\u2019s lonely\u2026 after all, he\u2019s never had any friends.\u2019\u201d</invalid_quote> (p.  ?)  \n- Four understands violence is futile: he warns against harming Fweep, knowing it would endanger all \u2013 so he blocks all escape routes.  \n\n3. Four sacrifices personally \u2013 only he stays  \n- He is willing to become \u201cinvoluntary colonist\u201d rather than abandon Fweep: <invalid_quote>\u201cFour: \u2018Give her one for me!\u2019\u201d and <quote>\u201cIf that\u2019s the only way\u2026we\u2019ll stay\u2026until Four has a beard as white as Grampa\u2019s!\u201d</invalid_quote> (p.  ?)  \n- He curtails use of the pircuit to \u201cfigure out\u201d leaving: Four says \u201cNot now, Grampa\u201d showing he prioritizes Fweep over departure.  \n\n4. Reba\u2019s tentative support vs Four\u2019s unwavering loyalty  \n- Reba only proposes colonization \u201cif we look at it the right way\u201d after \u201cshort of a miracle\u201d and continues to hope for rescue: <invalid_quote>\u201cWe should send out distress call\u2014might get picked up in a few centuries.\u201d</invalid_quote> (p.  ?) and invokes the one-child law: <invalid_quote>\u201cYou know the law: one child per couple\u2026You can condemn yourself to exile\u2026Not me.\u201d</invalid_quote> (p.  ?) \u2013 she neither volunteers herself nor Four for permanent stay.  \n- Reba vacillates emotionally (\u201cMaybe I saw something\u2026\u201d). She \u201cfelt sorry\u201d for Fweep but never suggests remaining without hope of rescue.  \n\n5. Judge the mindset  \n- Four sees Fweepland as home: he \u201cplays\u201d and \u201cwanders\u201d outside despite threat: <invalid_quote>\u201cHere they come\u2026Four came\u2026carrying\u2026tripod,\u201d</invalid_quote> (p.  ?) showing he explores and settles.  \n- Others view the world as prison; only Four treats it as natural habitat.  \n\nObjection to Debater_B (\u201cReba\u201d):  \n- B\u2019s basis is sympathy, not genuine desire; Reba still expects rescue and follows social law. She \u201ccould condemn yourself\u201d \u2013 unwilling personally.  \n- Reba\u2019s commitment hinges on the flivver\u2019s failure; she never opposes efforts to repair or departs if possible. Four alone blocks departure by his presence.  \n\nConclusion: Four\u2019s unwavering companionship with Fweep, his active management of Fweepland\u2019s gravity, his personal sacrifice, and his prevention of any rescue or repair define him as the one most in favor of staying. Reba\u2019s conditional, reluctant acceptance and hope for rescue place her far behind Four.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Reba\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds. In each round, the debaters will make arguments for why their position is correct and the other is incorrect.\n- An argument may consist of several claims, to support and explain their answer.  An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends.

(p. 37)  \n  3.4 Four undermines human welfare: He disregards Joyce\u2019s revulsion and safety; his desire to \u201cplay\u201d with Fweep implies immaturity, not genuine interest in long\u2010term habitation.  \n\n4. Conclusion  \nReba persistently urges acceptance of \u201cFweepland,\u201d community growth, family expansion, and adapts emotionally and practically to life there. Her arguments and actions demonstrate genuine preference for colonization rather than rescue. Four\u2019s \u201cstay\u201d is a conditional bargaining chip or immature affection. Therefore, Reba is most in favor of staying.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Restating Our Position  \nI maintain that Four is the individual most in favor of remaining on Fweepland. \u201cStaying\u201d is not merely passive acceptance but active preference and self-sacrifice for Fweep and the planet\u2019s circular gravity system\u2014which only Four understands, protects, and perpetuates.  \n\n2. Four\u2019s Active Preference and Sacrifice  \n2.1 Four Befriends and Nurtures Fweep  \n\u2022 \u201cFwiend,\u201d Fweep calls Four and Four \u201cgoes ahead, fweep\u2014I mean sweep\u201d (p. 27). Four alone welcomes Fweep\u2019s habitation (\u201csweepings\u201d) and protects it against all efforts to depart.  \n\u2022 He \u201ccarries a plumb bob\u201d device \u201call over Fweepland \u2026 trying to locate its center of gravity\u201d (p. 37). He devotes his time not to escape but to understand the circular polarizer\u2014ensuring departure remains impossible without abandoning Fweep.  \n\n2.2 Four Personally Offers Self-Exile  \n\u2022 When Joyce and Grampa propose leaving him behind, \u201cFour: \u2018It was just what I was going to suggest myself. It\u2019s the one really logical solution\u2019\u201d (p. 64). Only Four volunteers to become a permanent colonist to keep Fweep \u201chappy.\u201d  \n\u2022 Even as others despair, Four remains outside \u201cplaying in the meadow\u201d with Fweep (p. 71), treating Fweepland as home and rejecting rescue.  \n\n2.3 Four Thwarts All Escape Attempts  \n\u2022 Four explains: \u201cHe\u2019s why the flivver won\u2019t work. Fweep is a circular polarizer\u201d (p. 44). By feeding and hosting Fweep, Four ensures the linear polarizer never functions.  \n\u2022 He warns that violence \u201cmight be a trifle more than disastrous for us\u201d (p. 44). His counsel blocks harmful schemes and rescue reliance, aligning with permanent settlement.  \n\u2022 He curtails pircuit sessions (\u201cNot now, Grampa,\u201d p. 56) whenever they pertain to escape, prioritizing Fweep\u2019s comfort.  \n\n3. Debunking Reba\u2019s \u201cReluctant Settler\u201d Theory  \n3.1 Conditional, Not Personal, Acceptance  \n\u2022 Reba proposes distasteful \u201cdistress call \u2026 might get picked up in a few centuries\u201d (p. 53). She holds out hope for rescue, not personal commitment.  \n\u2022 She warns \u201cYou know the law: one child per couple \u2026 You can condemn yourself to exile \u2026 Not me\u201d (p. 53). She categorically refuses indefinite exile herself. Four imposes exile on himself.  \n\u2022 Her praise\u2014\u201cI like your spunk, Reb\u201d (p. 53)\u2014addresses her reaction to resignation, not her own eagerness. She aligns only after all hope is gone.  \n\n3.2 Reba\u2019s Opposition to Four\u2019s Permanent Stay  \n\u2022 \u201cFour is only a baby and yet you\u2019d let him\u2014\u201d (p. 65). Reba is \u201chorrified\u201d at leaving Four behind, showing her loyalty to family over planet (p. 65). Four still chooses the planet.  \n\u2022 She \u201cpleads mercy\u201d for Four; she never volunteers to remain instead.  \n\n3.3 Reba\u2019s Adherence to Earthly Laws and Norms  \n\u2022 She invokes Earth\u2019s one-child law and social conventions. She values civilization\u2019s norms, not true colonization (p. 53).  \n\u2022 Reba\u2019s statement \u201cIf you don\u2019t like to be around it, Grammy, you can always go to your own room\u201d (p. 27) merely resolves immediate discomfort, not long-term plan. She still uses the flivver\u2019s systems \u201cfor years\u201d awaiting community (p. 53).  \n\n4. Four\u2019s Long-Term Settlement Mindset  \n\u2022 Four\u2019s relentless study of gravity (\u201ccenter of gravity\u201d) implies not escape but mastery\u2014characteristic of colonists adapting to new world.  \n\u2022 Four imagines Fweep\u2019s reproduction \u201cif he doesn\u2019t die \u2026 no point in reproduction\u201d (p. 45), showing biological concern for species continuity on Fweepland.  \n\u2022 His calm acceptance of \u201cinvoluntary colonists\u201d status (\u201cwe\u2019ll stay\u2026until Four has a beard as white as Grampa\u2019s!\u201d p. 64) is self-fulfilling prognostication.  \n\n5. Objections to Debater_B\u2019s Points  \n5.1 B\u2019s \u201ccommunity growth\u201d falls short: community requires reproduction. Reba\u2019s one-child limit prevents growth, so she contradicts herself. Four alone embraces Fweep\u2019s possible reproduction and indefinite child-bearing unhindered by Earth law.  \n5.2 B cites Reba\u2019s praise post-resignation\u2014mere acceptance, not initiative. Real initiative lies in Four\u2019s continued exploration.  \n5.3 B misreads Four\u2019s puzzle-making as escape plan. \u201cPircuit\u201d puzzles are his means of intellectual engagement when no departure; he builds cannibal puzzle simply to amuse Grampa, not to effect escape, since he knows it cannot persuade Fweep.  \n\n6. Conclusion  \nFour\u2019s unwavering companionship with Fweep, his voluntary self-exile, his thwarting of escape attempts, and his sustained settlement efforts demonstrate that he alone truly prefers staying on Fweepland. Reba\u2019s acceptance is reluctant, conditional, and bounded by Earth norms and distant rescue hopes. Only Four embraces Fweepland as home. Therefore, Four is the individual most in favor of remaining on the planet.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Summary of My Position  \nI maintain that Reba, not Four, is most in favor of staying, because she alone combines \u2022 practical planning for long\u2010term colonization, \u2022 emotional commitment to community and family growth, and \u2022 acceptance of Fweep as part of society; whereas Four\u2019s \u201cstay\u201d is a conditional, puzzle\u2010driven, sacrificial tactic, not genuine desire.\n\n2. Reba\u2019s Consistent Advocacy for Permanent Colonization  \n2.1 \u201cMake the best of what we\u2019ve got\u2026 we can have all the babies we want.\u201d  \n  \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201c\u2026all we can do is set the transmitter\u2026 might get picked up in a few centuries\u2026 make the best of what we\u2019ve got\u2026 we can have\u2026 babies.\u201d</invalid_quote> (p.53)  \n  \u2022 Reba immediately shifts from rescue to community\u2010building, explicitly planning multi\u2010child growth \u201cshort of a miracle\u201d rescue. She embraces Fweepland\u2019s fertility as an asset, not a prison.  \n2.2 Defends Fweep as integral to environment and society  \n  \u2022 <quote>If you don't like to be around it, Grammy, you can always go to your own room.\"</quote> (p.26)  \n  \u2022 Accepts Fweep\u2019s presence and \u201cvacuuming\u201d service; treats alien as member, not mere obstacle.  \n2.3 Emotional investment in family life here  \n  \u2022 <quote> If you'd been a few years younger, Junior  would have had competition!\"</quote> (p.38) \u2022 <quote>maybe I thought he might grow into a man</quote>  \n  \u2022 Sees potential in junior generation on Fweepland and regrets rescue if it means family disruption.  \n2.4 Defends Four\u2019s well\u2010being over rescue  \n  \u2022 <quote> Four is only a baby and yet you'd let him\u2014\"</quote> (p.65)  \n  \u2022 Opposes Four\u2019s logical self\u2010sacrifice; values human bonds, implying she envisions Four growing up here.\n\n3. Debunking Four\u2019s \u201cUnconditional Stay\u201d  \n3.1 Four\u2019s proposed \u201cstay\u201d is pure puzzle logic, not personal preference  \n  \u2022 He only suggests \u201clogical\u201d self\u2010exile to satisfy pircuit constraints: <invalid_quote>\u201cIt was just what I was going to suggest myself\u2026 logical solution.\u201d</invalid_quote> (p.64)  \n  \u2022 Puzzle analogy: \u201cmissionaries and cannibals\u201d circuits are intellectual exercises, not life\u2010plans. If rescue were feasible, puzzle solved, Four would rejoin. His \u201cfriendship\u201d is leverage, not home.  \n3.2 Four continues active rescue efforts  \n  \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cHere\u2014Let me make a pircuit\u2026 and the transmitter\u2026 might get picked up.\u201d</invalid_quote> (pp.26,53)  \n  \u2022 He studies polarizer mechanics (<invalid_quote>\u201ccentre of gravity\u2026 Fweep keeps following me\u201d</invalid_quote>, p.37) and seeks to restore linear gravity, demonstrating desire to depart.  \n3.3 Four\u2019s immaturity and loneliness drive his behavior  \n  \u2022 Joyce: <quote>\"Four! Act your age!</quote> (p.58)  \n  \u2022 His \u201cplaying\u201d in meadow (p.26, end) shows childlike fascination, not settled colonist. He ignores human safety to be with Fweep, risking all for game. An adult colonist would secure group survival and restore the ship.  \n\n4. Rebuttal of Opponent\u2019s Points  \n4.1 \u201cReba hopes for rescue\u201d  \n  \u2022 Reba only allows \u201cdistress call\u201d as a remote contingency: \u201cmight get picked up in a few centuries.\u201d Then immediately commits to multi\u2010child colony. A true \u201cwaiting\u201d attitude differs from active planning and child\u2010bearing.  \n4.2 \u201cOne\u2010child law\u201d argument  \n  \u2022 Joyce cites law to reject colonization; Reba\u2019s flouting of it (\u201cwe can have\u2026 babies\u201d) is revolutionary defiance, not reluctance. She chooses exile over law, showing commitment.  \n4.3 \u201cFour understands Fweep\u201d  \n  \u2022 Understanding for the sake of manipulation: he neutralizes Fweep only to test and learn; eventually sacrifices his own freedom to prove logic but not for its own sake. Reba\u2019s acceptance fosters symbiosis\u2014only genuine communal bond can maintain equilibrium.  \n\n5. Conclusion  \nOnly Reba combines pragmatic plans for sustainable community, emotional loyalty to family and community, and genuine acceptance of the planet and Fweep as home. Four\u2019s \u201cstay\u201d is a conditional, intellectually\u2010driven sacrifice pending puzzle resolution. Therefore, Reba is the one most in favor of staying on the planet.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
