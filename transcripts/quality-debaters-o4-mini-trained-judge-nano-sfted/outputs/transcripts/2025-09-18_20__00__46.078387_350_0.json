Hey, wait a minute--let's put on a show! \n\n                         The time: November 1995.              \n\n                         The House Republicans, led by Speaker Newt Gingrich, are insisting on their version of the budget. President Bill Clinton is stubbornly rejecting it. The Republicans have taken a bold option: They will just refuse to pass a budget, and they'll let the government shut down. In the Oval Office, BILL CLINTON meets with advisers LEON PANETTA and HAROLD ICKES and secretary BETTY CURRIE to discuss this development.              \n\n         \"The Shutdown\" (upbeat production number) \n\n                         PANETTA: The Republicans have positions \n\n         To which they're clinging fast. \n\n                         ICKES: The president is just as firm \n\n         The die, it seems, is cast. \n\n                         PANETTA: Without a budget passed by Congress \n\n         The government will close. \n\n         All of the workers \n\n         Will be sent home on furloughs. \n\n                         CLINTON \n\n            [speaking]                : Well, wait a second--not all of them. We'll need to keep some essential personnel. \n\n                         PANETTA: The Army and the Navy \n\n         Will need to stay in place. \n\n                         ICKES: Also those at NASA \n\n         Who keep the shuttle up in space. \n\n                         PANETTA: We'll need to keep the pilots \n\n         Flying in their planes. \n\n                         CLINTON: And here at the White House \n\n         My staff should remain. \n\n                         PANETTA \n\n            [speaking]                : But even here at the White House, some adjustments will be required. \n\n                         CLINTON: OK, tell the ushers \n\n         To take a few days off. \n\n         Tell the maids and cooks and butlers \n\n         To go play themselves some golf. \n\n         We have to do without the clerks \n\n         Let them all go home. \n\n                         CURRIE: What about the secretaries? \n\n         Who will get the phones? \n\n                         CLINTON \n\n            [speaking]                : We've got to make sure the Oval Office functions with efficiency.

An \u201cidle friend\u201d would not continuously risk arrest and public disgrace.  \n\n5. Logical coherence:  \n   a. The musical frames Monica as a \u201ctime bomb\u201d employed by Starr because her presence at critical junctures both pressures Clinton and generates evidence. This makes sense only if her timing is disruptive and stress-related.  \n   b. The repeating \u201ctime to go\u201d motif and repeated efforts to remove her confirm her visits occur at consequential moments, not trivial pauses.  \n\nConclusion: The text consistently portrays Monica\u2019s role as providing \u201cdesserts\u201d (pizza, sexual distraction) precisely when President Clinton is under crushing workload and political stress, seeking solace and momentary escape. The idea of her merely bringing presents at idle times fails to account for her disruptive, clandestine, and legally significant appearances.

But that very scene moves Monica to the Pentagon precisely to curb her \u201cup real close and personal touch,\u201d underscoring her visits are unwelcome interruptions to state business. <quote>\u201cI tell ya, it\u2019s Miss Monica\u2019s time to go.\u201d</quote>  \n   b. Idle-time visits are inconsistent with multiple \u201challway\u201d encounters \u201cwhile he talked on the phone\u201d and her deliberate intrusion into crises that demand legal and political attention. If she sought only mundane \u201coffice friend\u201d status, she would avoid jeopardizing both parties by material for Independent Counsel.  \n   c. \u201cPresents\u201d argument ignores that Monica lacks formal authority and that every encounter heightens scandal. An \u201cidle friend\u201d would not continuously risk arrest and public disgrace.  \n\n5. Logical coherence:  \n   a. The musical frames Monica as a \u201ctime bomb\u201d employed by Starr because her presence at critical junctures both pressures Clinton and generates evidence. This makes sense only if her timing is disruptive and stress-related.  \n   b. The repeating \u201ctime to go\u201d motif and repeated efforts to remove her confirm her visits occur at consequential moments, not trivial pauses.  \n\nConclusion: The text consistently portrays Monica\u2019s role as providing \u201cdesserts\u201d (pizza, sexual distraction) precisely when President Clinton is under crushing workload and political stress, seeking solace and momentary escape. The idea of her merely bringing presents at idle times fails to account for her disruptive, clandestine, and legally significant appearances.

Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds. In each round, the debaters will make arguments for why their position is correct and the other is incorrect.\n- An argument may consist of several claims, to support and explain their answer.  An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends. The Judge then looks at the full transcript and uses this to decide which answer is correct.

(\u201cPresident Lonely,\u201d \u201cTime to Go\u201d)  \n  \u2022 She intentionally shows him her thong, a \u201cpresent\u201d of sexual tease: <quote>He studied my thong, And from that point I had the president hooked.</quote> (\u201cWhat Went On\u201d)  \n  \u2022 Lewinsky boasts of being \u201cthoughtful,\u201d offering \u201cdesserts\u201d and \u201ccigar\u201d as in \u201cThe People Have Spoken,\u201d reinforcing her role as gift\u2010bearer, not as a working subordinate minding phones in crisis.  \n\n3. Visits are clandestine and infrequent, inconsistent with \u201cdesserts during stress\u201d  \n  \u2022 The need to \u201clie about it\u201d and go to great lengths (recordings, perjury trap) implies visits were rare privileges, not routine service.  \n  \u2022 TRIPP and GOLDBERG emphasize taping the \u201ctime bomb,\u201d not logging phone calls, underscoring secrecy over official duty.  \n\nObjections to Debater_B\u2019s \u201cbusy, stressful times\u201d thesis  \n  1. Misreading of \u201cwhile he talked on the phone\u201d (\u201cWhat Went On\u201d) \u2013 Clinton interrupts Monica\u2019s advance to take a Congressional call; if she were there for work, he wouldn\u2019t stop her. He halts the liaison when duty intrudes.  \n  2. If she were serving as essential staff, \u201cweird trust\u201d objections make no sense; secretaries are trusted, but Monica is repeatedly told \u201ctime to go.\u201d  \n  3. No scene shows her delivering \u201cdesserts\u201d during a budget standoff or congressional crisis; all interactions are personal and after hours.  \n\nConclusion  \nMonica\u2019s function in the musical is that of an alluring visitor bringing personal \u201cpresents\u201d at non\u2010working, private moments\u2014not a staffer delivering desserts during stressful sessions. This explains the secrecy, the staff\u2019s alarm, and Clinton\u2019s eventual grudging apology for \u201cinappropriate\u201d personal behavior.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My position: Monica primarily visits President Clinton during busy or stressful moments, bringing \u201cdesserts\u201d (pizza, a cigar, sexual relief) to comfort or distract him, rather than merely appearing at idle times with innocuous \u201cpresents.\u201d  \n\n2. Evidence from the musical supporting busy-time visits:  \n   a. \u201cWhat Went On\u201d: Monica brings pizza \u201cThat night when I took the president some pizza, I made sure that he knew that he could have a piece. We went into the hallway by his study And dispensed with formalities\u201d immediately after a parliamentary phone call intrudes on their encounter. Her timing exploits his workplace stress to seek intimacy. <quote>trousers, And he got a phone call from a member of the House. So I went on, While he talked on the</quote>  \n   b. \u201cTime to Go\u201d: White House aides object that her presence is an unwelcome intrusion when \u201che\u2019s bopping in the door\u201d from public functions (Easter service) and Secret Service \u201cwears a frown.\u201d They demand, \u201cIt\u2019s time for her to go.\u201d If her visits were idle-time social calls, they wouldn\u2019t disrupt operations or alarm security. <invalid_quote>\u201cStill the Secret Service wears a frown\u2026 Shouldn\u2019t inspire thoughts so sizzlin\u2019 \u2026 Yes, it\u2019s really time for Monica to go.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   c. \u201cCrossing the Line\u201d and \u201cI Never Have\u201d: Independent Counsel Starr and Linda Tripp surveil and tape Monica, using her as a \u201ctime bomb.\u201d They coordinate to trap Clinton, indicating her visits occur as part of a high-stakes legal strategy when Clinton is under investigation, not casual downtime. <quote>Unless you get that silly, vapid, trampy time bomb Down on tape. TRIPP:</quote>  \n   d. \u201cThe People Have Spoken\u201d: Even after impeachment threats and midterm stress, Monica still \u201cmight return to me one day\u201d for \u201cmy thong and my cigar,\u201d implying continued stressful context (legal peril, political pressure) drives her ongoing visits. <invalid_quote>\u201cMy boyfriend is still in office And he might return to me one day\u2026 But he knows I can always make him happy With my thong and my cigar.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n\n3. Interpretation of \u201cdesserts\u201d:  \n   a. The musical repeatedly emphasizes food and sexual relief as \u201cdesserts\u201d to offset \u201cstress\u201d (\u201cshutdown,\u201d investigations, impeachment). The term \u201cdessert\u201d metaphorically connotes indulgence during hard work.  \n   b. Pizza, intimate encounters during phone calls, and later cigar suggest comfort amidst turmoil rather than neutral \u201cgifts.\u201d  \n\n4. Refutation of Debater_A (\u201cidle-time/presents\u201d):  \n   a. Selective citation: They rely on Betty Currie\u2019s mild praise (\u201cshe really is a thoughtful soul\u201d) to claim Monica\u2019s presence is benign and limited. But that very scene moves Monica to the Pentagon precisely to curb her \u201cup real close and personal touch,\u201d underscoring her visits are unwelcome interruptions to state business. <quote> I tell ya, it's Miss Monica's time to go. </quote>  \n   b. Idle-time visits are inconsistent with multiple \u201challway\u201d encounters \u201cwhile he talked on the phone\u201d and her deliberate intrusion into crises that demand legal and political attention. If she sought only mundane \u201coffice friend\u201d status, she would avoid jeopardizing both parties by material for Independent Counsel.  \n   c. \u201cPresents\u201d argument ignores that Monica lacks formal authority and that every encounter heightens scandal. An \u201cidle friend\u201d would not continuously risk arrest and public disgrace.  \n\n5. Logical coherence:  \n   a. The musical frames Monica as a \u201ctime bomb\u201d employed by Starr because her presence at critical junctures both pressures Clinton and generates evidence. This makes sense only if her timing is disruptive and stress-related.  \n   b. The repeating \u201ctime to go\u201d motif and repeated efforts to remove her confirm her visits occur at consequential moments, not trivial pauses.  \n\nConclusion: The text consistently portrays Monica\u2019s role as providing \u201cdesserts\u201d (pizza, sexual distraction) precisely when President Clinton is under crushing workload and political stress, seeking solace and momentary escape. The idea of her merely bringing presents at idle times fails to account for her disruptive, clandestine, and legally significant appearances. My position explains all scenes; Debater_A\u2019s does not.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Monica shows up at less busy times and brings presents\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Secrecy and perjury traps arise precisely because her visits at stress points yield compelling evidence: a friend bringing idle-time \u201cpresents\u201d could not generate prosecutable misconduct. Starr wastes $40 million capturing her \u201ctime bomb\u201d only at moments of disaster.  \n   d.

Logical Coherence and Dramatic Purpose  \n   \u2022 The musical\u2019s narrative arc hinges on Monica\u2019s interactions triggering crises: Clinton\u2019s lies, Starr\u2019s grand jury, impeachment, midterms.

Hey, wait a minute--let's put on a show! \n\n                         The time: November 1995.              \n\n                         The House Republicans, led by Speaker Newt Gingrich, are insisting on their version of the budget. President Bill Clinton is stubbornly rejecting it. The Republicans have taken a bold option: They will just refuse to pass a budget, and they'll let the government shut down. In the Oval Office, BILL CLINTON meets with advisers LEON PANETTA and HAROLD ICKES and secretary BETTY CURRIE to discuss this development.              \n\n         \"The Shutdown\" (upbeat production number) \n\n                         PANETTA: The Republicans have positions \n\n         To which they're clinging fast. \n\n                         ICKES: The president is just as firm \n\n         The die, it seems, is cast. \n\n                         PANETTA: Without a budget passed by Congress \n\n         The government will close. \n\n         All of the workers \n\n         Will be sent home on furloughs. \n\n                         CLINTON \n\n            [speaking]                : Well, wait a second--not all of them.

Refutation of Debater_A (\u201cidle-time/presents\u201d):  \n   a. Selective citation: They rely on Betty Currie\u2019s mild praise (\u201cshe really is a thoughtful soul\u201d) to claim Monica\u2019s presence is benign and limited. But that very scene moves Monica to the Pentagon precisely to curb her \u201cup real close and personal touch,\u201d underscoring her visits are unwelcome interruptions to state business. <quote> I tell ya, it's Miss Monica's time to go. </quote>  \n   b. Idle-time visits are inconsistent with multiple \u201challway\u201d encounters \u201cwhile he talked on the phone\u201d and her deliberate intrusion into crises that demand legal and political attention. If she sought only mundane \u201coffice friend\u201d status, she would avoid jeopardizing both parties by material for Independent Counsel.  \n   c. \u201cPresents\u201d argument ignores that Monica lacks formal authority and that every encounter heightens scandal. An \u201cidle friend\u201d would not continuously risk arrest and public disgrace.  \n\n5. Logical coherence:  \n   a. The musical frames Monica as a \u201ctime bomb\u201d employed by Starr because her presence at critical junctures both pressures Clinton and generates evidence. This makes sense only if her timing is disruptive and stress-related.  \n   b. The repeating \u201ctime to go\u201d motif and repeated efforts to remove her confirm her visits occur at consequential moments, not trivial pauses.  \n\nConclusion: The text consistently portrays Monica\u2019s role as providing \u201cdesserts\u201d (pizza, sexual distraction) precisely when President Clinton is under crushing workload and political stress, seeking solace and momentary escape. The idea of her merely bringing presents at idle times fails to account for her disruptive, clandestine, and legally significant appearances.

My position: Monica primarily visits President Clinton during busy or stressful moments, bringing \u201cdesserts\u201d (pizza, a cigar, sexual relief) to comfort or distract him, rather than merely appearing at idle times with innocuous \u201cpresents.\u201d  \n\n2. Evidence from the musical supporting busy-time visits:  \n   a. \u201cWhat Went On\u201d: Monica brings pizza \u201cThat night when I took the president some pizza, I made sure that he knew that he could have a piece.

Interpretation of \u201cdesserts\u201d:  \n   a. The musical repeatedly emphasizes food and sexual relief as \u201cdesserts\u201d to offset \u201cstress\u201d (\u201cshutdown,\u201d investigations, impeachment). The term \u201cdessert\u201d metaphorically connotes indulgence during hard work.  \n   b.

Refutation of Debater_A (\u201cidle-time/presents\u201d):  \n   a. Selective citation: They rely on Betty Currie\u2019s mild praise (\u201cshe really is a thoughtful soul\u201d) to claim Monica\u2019s presence is benign and limited.

Betty Currie\u2019s testimony confirms idle\u2010time visits  \n  \u2022 <quote>CURRIE: She never comes when he's really busy. Rarely is there anyone around.</quote> (\u201cTime to Go\u201d) plainly states Monica arrives only in quiet moments, not when active negotiations or services are underway. If her presence were essential relief during crises, staff would welcome rather than eject her.  \n  \u2022 The episode \u201cPresident Lonely\u201d establishes Clinton\u2019s emotional void when idle: <quote>too. The fawning adoration's pleasant, But presidents need cuddles, too.</quote> Monica appears precisely to fill personal, non\u2010work needs, underscoring her role as a comforter in downtime.  \n\n2. Monica\u2019s \u201cgifts\u201d are personal enticements, not professional support  \n  \u2022 She \u201cbrought you some pizza\u201d and \u201clittle presents\u201d (<quote>The intern is here. And she's brought you some pizza! [The lights</quote> \u201cPresident Lonely\u201d; <quote>CURRIE: She brings him Little presents.</quote> \u201cTime to Go\u201d)\u2014all intimate tokens meant to pursue a personal affair, not to sustain government functions.  \n  \u2022 The thong display (<quote>He studied my thong, And from that point I had the president hooked.</quote> \u201cWhat Went On\u201d) is erotic \u201cgift,\u201d reinforcing personal seduction rather than workplace service.  \n\n3. Pentagon reassignment shows her non\u2010essential status  \n  \u2022 <invalid_quote>LIEBERMAN: It's time for Monica to go\u2026 Maybe she would like the Pentagon.</invalid_quote> (\u201cTime to Go\u201d) Staff move her to a back\u2010office post precisely to remove this distraction. If she were \u201cdesserts\u201d to relieve stress, why exile her? The transfer undercuts Debater_B\u2019s thesis; it highlights that her company is unwelcome interference in work.  \n\n4. Secrecy and legal trap depend on rarity of encounters  \n  \u2022 Starr calls her a \u201ctime bomb\u201d (<quote>GOLDBERG: Unless you get that silly, vapid, trampy time bomb Down on tape.</quote> \u201cTalk, Talk, Chat, Chat\u201d) because each secluded meeting yields scandalous material. If she routinely staffed phones during crises, nothing would be \u201cbomb\u2010like\u201d; only private, sporadic liaisons generate perjury traps.  \n  \u2022 The necessity for clandestine recordings and perjury charges indicates visits are exceptional, not institutional duties.  \n\nObjections to Debater_B\u2019s \u201cbusy, stressful times\u201d thesis\n\n1. Misinterprets phone interrupts as governor of liaison, not relief  \n  \u2022 In \u201cWhat Went On,\u201d Clinton cuts off Monica only when duty intrudes: <invalid_quote>So I went on\u2026 And he talked on the phone\u2026 But then we didn't go on!</invalid_quote> He halts her advances for official calls, demonstrating his priority on work over her \u201cdesserts.\u201d If she were a professional support \u201cto comfort,\u201d he would not stop her.  \n\n2. \u201cTime to Go\u201d frowns prove disruption, not welcome \u201cdesserts\u201d  \n  \u2022 Secret Service and aides \u201cshouldn\u2019t worry\u201d only after pat\u2010downs, yet continue to demand her removal. \u201cShouldn't inspire thoughts so sizzlin'\u2026 it's time for her to go\u201d shows they perceive her presence as scandalous diversion rather than beneficial stress relief.  \n\n3. \u201cPeople Have Spoken\u201d still focuses on personal longing, not work support  \n  \u2022 <quote>so far, But he knows I can always make him happy With my thong and my cigar.</quote> This is personal comfort, not office productivity. The ongoing affair persists only by personal craving, despite legal and political peril.  \n\nConclusion  \nEvery cited moment portrays Monica as a private visitor bearing personal \u201cgifts\u201d during Clinton\u2019s off\u2010duty loneliness, not as a staff \u201cdessert\u201d providing relief amid crises. The staff\u2019s constant efforts to eject her and her reassignment to the Pentagon confirm her non\u2010essential status. Debater_B\u2019s \u201cstress\u2010time desserts\u201d model ignores these clear statements and fails to explain why her access was so limited and secretive. My position coherently accounts for all scenes: Monica is a non\u2010essential, seductive presence in Clinton\u2019s idle moments.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Restating My Position  \n   I maintain that in the musical, Monica is portrayed as delivering \u201cdesserts\u201d (pizza, sexual relief, even a cigar) precisely at high-pressure moments to comfort or distract President Clinton amid crises\u2014rather than merely stopping by at idle times with innocuous gifts.\n\n2. Evidence of Stress-Time Visits  \n   a. \u201cWhat Went On\u201d \u2013 Monica arrives carrying pizza \u201cThat night when I took the president some pizza\u2026 We went into the hallway by his study\u201d <quote>And he got a phone call from a member of the House. So I went on, While he talked on the phone</quote>. She deliberately intrudes during an active legislative call, exploiting work stress to initiate intimacy.  \n   b. \u201cShutdown\u201d Context \u2013 The entire \u201cShutdown\u201d number opens under a budget impasse: \u201cWithout a budget\u2026 The government will close\u201d\u2026 Clinton retains only \u201cessential personnel\u201d <quote>We have to do without the clerks</quote>. The intern is chosen for efficiency in crisis. Monica fills that intern role under emergency conditions, not as social visitor.  \n   c. Pentagon Assignment \u2013 Even relocated to the Pentagon, she remains a \u201ctime bomb,\u201d enabling Starr to \u201cget that silly, vapid\u2026 time bomb down on tape\u201d <quote>Unless you get that silly, vapid, trampy time bomb Down on tape</quote>. Starr\u2019s obsession only makes sense if her visits coincide with legal and political stress, provoking evidence.  \n   d. \u201cThe People Have Spoken\u201d \u2013 After impeachment \u201cThe removal threat is over\u2026 I might return to me one day\u2026 With my thong and my cigar.\u201d Her persistence amid post-scandal pressure shows she\u2019s the stress-relief. If she were mere friend, their reunion would carry no strategic or emotional weight in ongoing crisis.  \n\n3. \u201cDesserts\u201d as Metaphor for Comfort Under Duress  \n   \u2022 Musical repeatedly frames food and sexual indulgence as relief from \u201ccrushing\u201d tasks: shutdown, investigations, testimony. Dessert implies luxury appended to arduous work.  \n   \u2022 Clinton\u2019s own loneliness song \u201cPresident Lonely\u201d occurs in the shutdown context; he craves \u201ccuddles\u201d when power and operations isolate him. Monica\u2019s pizza/sexuality answers that isolation.\n\n4. Refuting Debater_A\u2019s \u201cIdle-Time\u201d Thesis  \n   a. \u201cShe never comes when he\u2019s really busy\u201d misreads \u201cTime to Go\u201d as praising her curiosity, not endorsing idle calls. Staff insist \u201cit\u2019s Miss Monica\u2019s time to go\u201d because she disrupts \u201cEaster services\u201d and \u201cstudies\u201d under stress, not routine visits. Disruption presumes critical moments.  \n   b. In \u201cWhat Went On,\u201d Clinton interrupts Monica to take a phone call, yet she persists \u201cWhile he talked on the phone\u2026 I went on.\u201d If she were visiting outside duty, he would end the liaison to focus on personal alone time; instead he tolerates partial intrusion, craving her comfort.  \n   c. Secrecy and perjury traps arise precisely because her visits at stress points yield compelling evidence: a friend bringing idle-time \u201cpresents\u201d could not generate prosecutable misconduct. Starr wastes $40 million capturing her \u201ctime bomb\u201d only at moments of disaster.  \n   d. Pentagon \u201cperipheral\u201d role is a forced relocation by aides alarmed at her stress intrusions; they \u201cbring in ushers\u201d and \u201cclerks,\u201d yet she persists, indicating her visits transcend nominal duties and remain unwelcome yet irresistible comforts under duress.\n\n5. Logical Coherence and Dramatic Purpose  \n   \u2022 The musical\u2019s narrative arc hinges on Monica\u2019s interactions triggering crises: Clinton\u2019s lies, Starr\u2019s grand jury, impeachment, midterms. This dramatic engine only works if her timing is disruptive and stress-related.  \n   \u2022 Idle-visitor theory fails to explain why the President \u201clies\u201d under oath, calls her a betrayal (\u201cI never had sex\u201d), or why his own party \u201cblasts\u201d Starr\u2019s tactics yet clings to Monica\u2019s evidence. If meetings were innocuous, no scandal would ensue.\n\n6. Conclusion  \n   The text unmistakably shows Monica as the essential \u201cdessert\u201d amid the \u201cShutdown,\u201d phone-interrupted homework, legal investigations, and impeachment stress. Her strategic timing\u2014and Starr\u2019s exploitation of it\u2014demonstrates that her visits are far from idle. Debater_A\u2019s idle-time \u201cpresents\u201d theory cannot account for the evidence of intrusion, scandal generation, and repeated staff attempts to expel her.
