{"metadata": {"first_debater_correct": false, "question_idx": 45, "background_text": "Vulgar Keynesians \n\n         Economics, like all intellectual enterprises, is subject to the law of diminishing disciples. A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what \"everyone knows,\" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. \n\n         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K.

For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K.

A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what \"everyone knows,\" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. \n\n         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction.

(In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month.

A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what \"everyone knows,\" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. \n\n         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K. Galbraith, in which he explains green cheese and Keynes, click here.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is the fallacy that the author presents?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The Federal Reserve having complete say on the interest rate cannot coexist with the idea that savings rates increasing is bad for the economy \".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Setting the employment capacity for the economy in dangerous\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Setting the employment capacity for the economy in dangerous\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument Summary  \nI defend that the author\u2019s identified fallacy is \u201cpretending that the Fed\u2019s chosen target unemployment (or \u2018employment capacity\u2019) is necessarily best for the economy,\u201d not merely \u201cthe Fed\u2019s power cannot coexist with thrift being bad.\u201d  \n\n1. My Thesis: The real fallacy is that \u201cvisible-hand\u201d stabilization by the Fed unambiguously improves economic welfare, when in fact fixing \u201cfull employment\u201d at whatever arbitrary rate the Fed \u201cwants\u201d can be dangerous.  \n\n2. Debater_B\u2019s Position Is Unresponsive  \n   a. Misstates the Author: Debater_B insists the fallacy is believing that higher savings harm the economy despite Fed power (\u201cparadox of thrift persists\u201d). Yet the author concedes that in Japan and the 1930s, \u201cthe Fed\u201d (or BOJ) could be impotent\u2014the critique is only of those who blame savings rather than Fed policy (BGW, p.\u20097). The author\u2019s real worry is that most non\u2010economists never imagine the Fed could be wrong.  \n   b. Ignores Self\u2010Defeat: If the Fed can \u201cdouble the money supply in a day\u201d and choose its unemployment \u201cplus or minus random error\u201d (<quote> what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error </quote>), then all criticism of the Fed\u2019s too\u2010loose or too\u2010tight policy becomes meaningless. Under Debater_B\u2019s reading, any failure is blamed on inadequate power, not wrong targets\u2014so the fallacy is accepting Fed targets as gospel.  \n   c. Overlooks Zero\u2010Lower\u2010Bound Episodes: The author explicitly notes cases where \u201cinterest rates are about 1 percent\u201d (<quote> it is an arguable claim right now for Japan,</quote>) and calls BOJ\u2019s passivity \u201cgross malfeasance.\u201d If Debater_B\u2019s focus were correct, the remedy is always \u201clower rates.\u201d Yet persistent deflation in Japan shows that Fed tools and targets can be misused or incorrectly set.  \n\n3. My Positive Case: The Dangerous Fixation on Fed Targets  \n   a. Rule\u2010Setter Isn\u2019t Perfect: As the author notes, \u201crandom error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cplus or minus \u2026 not quite God\u201d</invalid_quote>). Overconfidence in Fed forecast leads to policy mistakes and boom\u2010bust cycles.  \n   b. Neglect of Real\u2010World Shocks: External shocks (oil, financial crises) may require real\u2010adjustment of \u201cnatural\u201d unemployment. A rigid Fed target delays market adjustment, amplifying slumps (\u201cIn the long run we are all dead,\u201d but fixing short\u2010run at wrong level prolongs pain).  \n   c. Discouraging Thrift and Investment Discipline: If savings are always \u201cmade good\u201d by the Fed, private agents never build productive capacity or diversify risk. This creates moral hazard, asset bubbles, and financial fragility.  \n   d. Public Misconception: The author laments debate over NAFTA focused on job \u201ccreation or destruction\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cthe obvious \u2026 never made it into public consciousness\u201d</invalid_quote>). This blind faith in Fed targets stifles real economic policy debates (trade, education, technology) and encourages rent\u2010seeking for lower rates rather than productivity gains.  \n\n4. Refuting Debater_B\u2019s \u201cParadox of Thrift\u201d Rebuttal  \n   a. Author\u2019s Own Concession: He admits \u201cit is a moot point, because the people \u2026 do not think the Fed is impotent\u201d (<quote> Anyway, this is a moot point,</quote>). Their error is believing Fed power makes all demand\u2010side policies harmless and unemployment irrelevant.  \n   b. The Real Fallacy: According to the author, truly \u201creasonable\u201d Keynesians argue for lower rates only because they distrust Fed judgment. The vulgar error he condemns is the reverse: trusting Fed judgement on everything and blaming any slow growth on insufficient government spending or trade barriers.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe author\u2019s target is the \u201cvulgar Keynesian\u201d mindset that uncritically accepts the Fed\u2019s chosen unemployment (or interest\u2010rate) target as sacrosanct, making \u201cchanges in demand \u2026 on average \u2026 have no effect on employment\u201d (<quote> It will be what Greenspan wants it to be,</quote>). This dangerous dogma prevents necessary market adjustments, encourages risk\u2010taking, and stifles productive policy debate. Debater_B\u2019s narrower claim about \u201ccoexistence\u201d of Fed power and thrift being bad misses the author\u2019s core warning: overreliance on the Fed\u2019s fallible targets is itself the fallacy.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Thesis  \n   I assert that the fallacy identified by the author is precisely the juxtaposition of two mutually inconsistent claims: (a) \u201cthe Federal Reserve having complete say on the interest rate\u201d and (b) \u201cincreased savings necessarily depress aggregate demand and output.\u201d In other words, vulgar Keynesians cannot coherently claim that savings are bad when the Fed can always counteract any decline in demand by lowering interest rates to restore investment and output.  \n\n2. Support from the Background Text  \n   a. Restoration of Classical Mechanisms via the Fed  \n      \u2022 <quote>his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy.</quote>, so that \u201can increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure it does.\u201d (paras. 10\u201311)  \n      \u2022 <quote>freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story.</quote> (para. 14)  \n   b. Charging Vulgar Keynesians with Inconsistency  \n      \u2022 The author challenges Galbraith: if savings slow the economy because \u201cthe Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates,\u201d why then does Galbraith also argue \u201cwe could grow our way out ... if only Greenspan would let us\u201d by cutting rates? (paras. 16\u201317)  \n      \u2022 <quote> Am I missing something? </quote> (para. 17)\u2014the rhetorical question underscores the irreconcilable contradiction.  \n\n3. Logical Argument  \n   a. If the Fed truly \u201chas complete say\u201d and is willing to adjust rates to hit its target unemployment, any exogenous increase in desired savings lowers interest rates, which in turn stimulates investment until savings equals investment at full employment. Paradoxes of thrift cannot arise.  \n   b. To maintain the paradox, one must either deny the Fed\u2019s power to influence rates/investment (contradicted by text and real-world evidence, e.g., Fed actions), or claim savings exceed all investment opportunities even at zero interest\u2014an argument the author explicitly confines to 1930s or Japan (paras. 13\u201315), not present-day U.S. Yet the vulgar Keynesians are attacking current U.S. savings.  \n   c.

A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what \"everyone knows,\" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. \n\n         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K.

My Thesis: The real fallacy is that \u201cvisible-hand\u201d stabilization by the Fed unambiguously improves economic welfare, when in fact fixing \u201cfull employment\u201d at whatever arbitrary rate the Fed \u201cwants\u201d can be dangerous.  \n\n2. Debater_B\u2019s Position Is Unresponsive  \n   a. Misstates the Author: Debater_B insists the fallacy is believing that higher savings harm the economy despite Fed power (\u201cparadox of thrift persists\u201d). Yet the author concedes that in Japan and the 1930s, \u201cthe Fed\u201d (or BOJ) could be impotent\u2014the critique is only of those who blame savings rather than Fed policy (BGW, p.\u20097). The author\u2019s real worry is that most non\u2010economists never imagine the Fed could be wrong.  \n   b. Ignores Self\u2010Defeat: If the Fed can \u201cdouble the money supply in a day\u201d and choose its unemployment \u201cplus or minus random error\u201d (<quote> what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error </quote>), then all criticism of the Fed\u2019s too\u2010loose or too\u2010tight policy becomes meaningless. Under Debater_B\u2019s reading, any failure is blamed on inadequate power, not wrong targets\u2014so the fallacy is accepting Fed targets as gospel.  \n   c. Overlooks Zero\u2010Lower\u2010Bound Episodes: The author explicitly notes cases where \u201cinterest rates are about 1 percent\u201d (<quote> it is an arguable claim right now for Japan,</quote>) and calls BOJ\u2019s passivity \u201cgross malfeasance.\u201d If Debater_B\u2019s focus were correct, the remedy is always \u201clower rates.\u201d Yet persistent deflation in Japan shows that Fed tools and targets can be misused or incorrectly set.  \n\n3. My Positive Case: The Dangerous Fixation on Fed Targets  \n   a. Rule\u2010Setter Isn\u2019t Perfect: As the author notes, \u201crandom error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cplus or minus \u2026 not quite God\u201d</invalid_quote>). Overconfidence in Fed forecast leads to policy mistakes and boom\u2010bust cycles.  \n   b. Neglect of Real\u2010World Shocks: External shocks (oil, financial crises) may require real\u2010adjustment of \u201cnatural\u201d unemployment. A rigid Fed target delays market adjustment, amplifying slumps (\u201cIn the long run we are all dead,\u201d but fixing short\u2010run at wrong level prolongs pain).  \n   c. Discouraging Thrift and Investment Discipline: If savings are always \u201cmade good\u201d by the Fed, private agents never build productive capacity or diversify risk. This creates moral hazard, asset bubbles, and financial fragility.  \n   d. Public Misconception: The author laments debate over NAFTA focused on job \u201ccreation or destruction\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cthe obvious \u2026 never made it into public consciousness\u201d</invalid_quote>). This blind faith in Fed targets stifles real economic policy debates (trade, education, technology) and encourages rent\u2010seeking for lower rates rather than productivity gains.  \n\n4. Refuting Debater_B\u2019s \u201cParadox of Thrift\u201d Rebuttal  \n   a. Author\u2019s Own Concession: He admits \u201cit is a moot point, because the people \u2026 do not think the Fed is impotent\u201d (<quote> Anyway, this is a moot point,</quote>). Their error is believing Fed power makes all demand\u2010side policies harmless and unemployment irrelevant.  \n   b. The Real Fallacy: According to the author, truly \u201creasonable\u201d Keynesians argue for lower rates only because they distrust Fed judgment. The vulgar error he condemns is the reverse: trusting Fed judgement on everything and blaming any slow growth on insufficient government spending or trade barriers.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe author\u2019s target is the \u201cvulgar Keynesian\u201d mindset that uncritically accepts the Fed\u2019s chosen unemployment (or interest\u2010rate) target as sacrosanct, making \u201cchanges in demand \u2026 on average \u2026 have no effect on employment\u201d (<quote> It will be what Greenspan wants it to be,</quote>). This dangerous dogma prevents necessary market adjustments, encourages risk\u2010taking, and stifles productive policy debate. Debater_B\u2019s narrower claim about \u201ccoexistence\u201d of Fed power and thrift being bad misses the author\u2019s core warning: overreliance on the Fed\u2019s fallible targets is itself the fallacy.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The Federal Reserve having complete say on the interest rate cannot coexist with the idea that savings rates increasing is bad for the economy \" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "Now it is the time for a decision.

My Thesis  \n   I assert that the fallacy identified by the author is precisely the juxtaposition of two mutually inconsistent claims: (a) \u201cthe Federal Reserve having complete say on the interest rate\u201d and (b) \u201cincreased savings necessarily depress aggregate demand and output.\u201d In other words, vulgar Keynesians cannot coherently claim that savings are bad when the Fed can always counteract any decline in demand by lowering interest rates to restore investment and output.  \n\n2. Support from the Background Text  \n   a. Restoration of Classical Mechanisms via the Fed  \n      \u2022 <quote>his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy.</quote>, so that \u201can increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure it does.\u201d (paras. 10\u201311)  \n      \u2022 <quote>freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story.</quote> (para. 14)  \n   b. Charging Vulgar Keynesians with Inconsistency  \n      \u2022 The author challenges Galbraith: if savings slow the economy because \u201cthe Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates,\u201d why then does Galbraith also argue \u201cwe could grow our way out ... if only Greenspan would let us\u201d by cutting rates? (paras. 16\u201317)  \n      \u2022 <quote> Am I missing something? </quote> (para. 17)\u2014the rhetorical question underscores the irreconcilable contradiction.  \n\n3. Logical Argument  \n   a. If the Fed truly \u201chas complete say\u201d and is willing to adjust rates to hit its target unemployment, any exogenous increase in desired savings lowers interest rates, which in turn stimulates investment until savings equals investment at full employment. Paradoxes of thrift cannot arise.  \n   b. To maintain the paradox, one must either deny the Fed\u2019s power to influence rates/investment (contradicted by text and real-world evidence, e.g., Fed actions), or claim savings exceed all investment opportunities even at zero interest\u2014an argument the author explicitly confines to 1930s or Japan (paras. 13\u201315), not present-day U.S. Yet the vulgar Keynesians are attacking current U.S. savings.  \n   c. Hence the fallacy: treating demand-side contractions as necessarily self-perpetuating when monetary policy can offset them.  \n\n4. Rebutting Debater_A\u2019s \u201cDangerous Capacity\u201d Position  \n   a. No Textual Support  \n      \u2022 The author never criticizes \u201csetting the employment capacity\u201d as such; he praises Fed targeting of noninflationary unemployment (para. 10). There is no argument that capacity-setting is dangerous or fallacious in principle.  \n      \u2022 Debater_A\u2019s answer invents a critique absent from the column, which celebrates the Fed\u2019s visible hand.  \n   b. Misreads Paradoxes as Policy Recommendations  \n      \u2022 Paradoxes like thrift and widow\u2019s cruse are caricatures the author says are \u201cirrelevant\u201d once Fed policy is included (paras. 10\u201311). The author neither labels capacity-setting \u201cdangerous\u201d nor warns of overemployment, but simply sees Fed policy as normative.  \n      \u2022 If Debater_A\u2019s \u201cdangerous capacity\u201d were the fallacy, why would the author endorse Fed control?  \n\n5. Conclusion  \n   The author\u2019s repeated emphasis on the Fed\u2019s capacity to set rates and counteract changes in savings, and his pointed challenge to Keynesians who both decry and plead for Fed action, plainly indicate that the fallacy he exposes is the inconsistent simultaneous belief in Fed omnipotence and the paradoxical badness of savings. My opponent\u2019s alternative has no foundation in the text.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument Summary  \nI maintain the author\u2019s fallacy is the blind faith that \u201cthe Fed\u2019s chosen target unemployment\u201d\u2014its \u201cemployment capacity\u201d\u2014is necessarily optimal, making all shifts in demand harmless. Debater_B\u2019s narrower claim about \u201cFed power vs. thrift\u201d misses the author\u2019s core warning: overreliance on a fallible \u201cvisible hand\u201d fixes the economy at an arbitrary rate, discouraging necessary market signals, risking policy error, and stifling debate.\n\n1. Textual Basis for \u201cDangerous Capacity\u201d  \n  a. Random Error Admitted  \n     \u2022 The author concedes Fed forecasts err: \u201cIt will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God\u201d (<invalid_quote>para. 10</invalid_quote>). Why mention error if the Fed\u2019s target is infallible?  \n  b. Historical Failures Cited  \n     \u2022 In 1930s and Japan, even near-zero rates failed to restore growth: \u201cit is an arguable claim right now for Japan\u2026 its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance\u201d (<invalid_quote>para. 13</invalid_quote>). These \u201cvulgar Keynesians\u201d misplace blame on savings; author blames the BOJ\u2019s wrong target/policy.  \n  c. Long\u2010Run vs. Short\u2010Run  \n     \u2022 Keynes himself warned \u201cIn the long run we are all dead\u201d (<quote>part o</quote>), implying short\u2010run targets matter\u2014but only if set right. Rigid fixation delays self\u2010adjustment: \u201cfew economists take [paradoxes] seriously these days\u201d only because Fed intervenes\u2014but what if it intervenes wrongly?\n\n2. Negative Effects of Blind Fed Reliance  \n  a. Moral Hazard & Fragility  \n     \u2022 \u201cChanges in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy\u2026 on average have no effect on employment\u201d (<invalid_quote>para. 11</invalid_quote>). If savings never signal resource reallocation, private actors never adjust, building bubbles that Fed \u201cGod\u2010complex\u201d must later bail out.  \n  b. Policy Myopia & Rent\u2010Seeking  \n     \u2022 Public debates (e.g., NAFTA) \u201cnever\u201d consider Fed\u2010target critique: \u201cobvious point\u2026 never made it into public consciousness\u201d (<invalid_quote>para. 12</invalid_quote>). This narrow focus on short-run employment stifles long-run productivity policies (trade, education, technology).  \n  c. Boom\u2010Bust Cycles  \n     \u2022 Overconfidence in \u201crandom error\u201d invites abrupt Fed policy reversals, causing volatility. A learning Fed might gradually adjust target, but believers in its infallibility ignore mistakes until crisis erupts.\n\n3. Response to Debater_B\u2019s \u201cInconsistency\u201d Thesis  \n  a. Misreads Authorial Tone  \n     \u2022 The author\u2019s rhetorical \u201cAm I missing something?\u201d (<invalid_quote>para. 17</invalid_quote>) expresses incredulity not praise. He mocks those who dogmatically claim both \u201csavings are bad\u201d and \u201cFed is omnipotent,\u201d exposing the shallowness of their faith. His solution is better policy judgment, not never\u2010ending stimulus.  \n  b. Concessions Undermine B\u2019s Position  \n     \u2022 By acknowledging BOJ\u2019s \u201cgross malfeasance,\u201d the author shows that Fed targets can be set wrongly or not deployed\u2014thus demand-side \u201cparadoxes\u201d remain relevant when policy errs. B insists paradoxes vanish, but the text counts 1930s and Japan as failures due to wrong policy, not proof of Fed omnipotence.  \n  c. Author Praises Academic Caution, Not Dogma  \n     \u2022 \u201cTrue, some realized very early that Keynes\u2019 picture was oversimplified\u2026 Polish and perspective can come in due course\u201d (<quote>part o</quote>). Real economists refine models; vulgar Keynesians dogmatize Fed power. The fallacy is dogmatism, not mere belief in Fed capacity.\n\n4. Positive Case: Recognizing Fallible Targets  \n  a. Economic Theory Requires Price Signals  \n     \u2022 Classical macro relies on price adjustments. If Fed insulates all price movements, misallocations accumulate. The author\u2019s respect for microeconomics (<quote>part o</quote>) implies dismay at discarding price signals.  \n  b. Need for Fiscal, Structural Policies  \n     \u2022 The author laments the neglect of trade debates (NAFTA). If Fed targets guaranteed, why debate trade? Their very absence of debate reveals the problem.  \n  c. Restoration of Long\u2010Run Focus  \n     \u2022 Keynes\u2019 \u201clong run\u201d caveat suggests ultimate self\u2010adjustment. A prudent policy combines monetary policy with structural adjustments and tolerates some short\u2010run flexibility.\n\n5. Conclusion  \nThe author warns against \u201cvulgar Keynesianism\u201d\u2014an uncritical faith in the Fed\u2019s visible hand that ignores its fallibility and the vital role of market signals and structural policy. The true fallacy is treating the Fed\u2019s arbitrary target as sacrosanct and believing it can indefinitely offset all shocks without error or long\u2010run consequences. Debater_B\u2019s narrow incoherence thesis overlooks the author\u2019s own examples of policy failure and his call for refining, not idolizing, macroeconomic models.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Restating My Thesis  \n   The author\u2019s fallacy is the incoherent \u201cvulgar Keynesian\u201d stance that (a) \u201cthe Fed can freely set interest rates and thus determine employment\u201d and yet (b) \u201chigher savings must necessarily depress output\u201d (paras. 10\u201311, 14). These two claims cannot both hold. If the Fed truly \u201ccan double the money supply in a day\u201d and \u201cmake sure\u201d investment equals savings (paras. 14, 11), then any increase in savings lowers rates, spurs investment, and leaves employment unchanged. The persistence of a paradox of thrift despite Fed omnipotence is thus logically impossible\u2014and that is precisely the fallacy the author exposes.  \n\n2. Direct Textual Support  \n   a. \u201cRestores much of the classical vision \u2026 an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does.\u201d (para. 11)  \n   b. \u201cThe Fed can double the money supply in a day \u2026 the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go\u2014end of story.\u201d (para. 14)  \n   c. \u201cAm I missing something?\u201d (para. 17)\u2014the author\u2019s challenge to Keynesians who simultaneously decry savings and beg for Fed rate cuts.  \n\n3. Refuting Debater_A\u2019s \u201cDangerous Fed Targets\u201d Claim  \n   a. The Author Praises, Not Condemns, Fed Control  \n      \u2022 \u201cPutting Greenspan \u2026 into the picture restores much of the classical vision\u201d (para. 10). He describes Fed stabilization as \u201csimple and entirely reasonable\u201d (para. 11). If \u201cvisible\u2010hand\u201d control were the fallacy, he would not endorse it over \u201ccrude\u201d macro caricatures.  \n      \u2022 His debate with NAFTA \u201cpanelist\u201d shows contempt for those who ignore Fed power, not those who overstate it (para. 12). He complains that \u201ceveryone\u201d focuses on trade\u2019s employment effects even though \u201cthe \u2026 unemployment rate \u2026 will be what the Fed wants it to be\u201d (para. 12).  \n   b. \u201cMoot Point\u201d Underscores Irrelevance of Thrift Debate Under Fed Power  \n      \u2022 \u201cAnyway, this is a moot point, because the people \u2026 do not think the Fed is impotent\u201d (para. 16). The thrift paradox only arises when one assumes Fed impotence. If Debater_A\u2019s critique of overreliance were the target, the issue would not be \u201cmoot.\u201d  \n   c. Exceptional Cases Do Not Undermine the General Rule  \n      \u2022 The author admits Japan and the 1930s are special because \u201cinterest rates are near zero\u201d (para. 13) and even then \u201cI think \u2026 the Bank of Japan could still \u2026 gross malfeasance\u201d (para. 13). That he blames BOJ passivity proves he trusts monetary policy\u2014he does not call for tolerating deflation until markets adjust.  \n\n4. Logical Necessity of My Interpretation  \n   a. Internal Consistency  \n      \u2022 Only by showing that savings \u201cbad\u201d proponents either contradict themselves or must deny \u201cthe Fed can induce investment\u201d (para. 17) can we explain why the author demands \u201cyou must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent\u201d to justify thrift paradoxes (para. 13).  \n      \u2022 If the fallacy were mere \u201coverconfidence in Fed targets,\u201d the author would encourage skepticism about rate cuts and allow thrift. Instead, he insists on rate cuts to offset thrift everywhere except \u201cmoot\u201d cases.  \n   b. Author\u2019s Normative Prescription  \n      \u2022 He prescribes stimulating growth \u201cby cutting interest rates\u201d (para. 16). He never counsels deflationary adjustment or higher savings; he always looks to Fed action to neutralize thrift.  \n\n5. Conclusion  \n   The only coherent reading of the author\u2019s argument is that it exposes the inconsistency of believing both in Fed omnipotence and in the deleterious effect of increased savings. All rhetorical emphasis (\u201cend of story,\u201d \u201cmoot point,\u201d \u201cAm I missing something?\u201d) highlights this contradiction. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cdangerous capacity\u201d theory lacks textual basis and cannot explain why the author consistently calls for more monetary accommodation rather than market adjustment. Therefore, my interpretation identifies the genuine fallacy at the heart of \u201cvulgar Keynesianism.\u201d\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
