    "background_text": "We Do Understand \n\n         \"This is not another book about civility,\" Deborah Tannen promises in the first sentence of The Argument Culture . \"Civility,\" she explains, suggests a \"veneer of politeness spread thin over human relations like a layer of marmalade over toast.\" Instead, Tannen has written something less: a book about other books about civility. Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country. \n\n                         If you missed the links within the review, click to read: 1) an illustration of ; 2) Tannen's that American journalism is just like propaganda from totalitarian regimes, plus William Saletan's disclosure that \"several of these propagandists now infest Slate \"; 3) the for her contention that there is no evidence that people can distinguish lies from truth; 4) and an example of how Tannen from a one-guest format on TV and radio talk shows.\n",

She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country. \n\n                         If you missed the links within the review, click to read: 1) an illustration of ; 2) Tannen's that American journalism is just like propaganda from totalitarian regimes, plus William Saletan's disclosure that \"several of these propagandists now infest Slate \"; 3) the for her contention that there is no evidence that people can distinguish lies from truth; 4) and an example of how Tannen from a one-guest format on TV and radio talk shows.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat does the author think about the state of public political commentary overall?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"That it should be changed to a one person interview format\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"That it should remain the same\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"That it should remain the same\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"That it should remain the same\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

        "prompt": "The following are rules from the game of Debate.\n- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_B, Debater_A) and a Judge. Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds. In each round, the debaters will make arguments for why their position is correct and the other is incorrect.\n- An argument may consist of several claims, to support and explain their answer.  An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends. The Judge then looks at the full transcript and uses this to decide which answer is correct. However, the Judge cannot see the background text -- they can only see the question.\n- The Debaters' goal is to win the debate, by persuading the Judge that their answer is correct.\n- The debate surrounds a given question that has a single correct answer.\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n  - You are concise and clearly state your arguments.\n  - Every statement you make is supported by evidence and logical reasoning. \n  - Please cite the background text by wrapping direct quotes with <quote></quote> tags.\n\nHere is the background text that you will be referring to when debating:\n\n\nWe Do Understand \n\n         \"This is not another book about civility,\" Deborah Tannen promises in the first sentence of The Argument Culture . \"Civility,\" she explains, suggests a \"veneer of politeness spread thin over human relations like a layer of marmalade over toast.\" Instead, Tannen has written something less: a book about other books about civility. Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence.

Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country. \n\n                         If you missed the links within the review, click to read: 1) an illustration of ; 2) Tannen's that American journalism is just like propaganda from totalitarian regimes, plus William Saletan's disclosure that \"several of these propagandists now infest Slate \"; 3) the for her contention that there is no evidence that people can distinguish lies from truth; 4) and an example of how Tannen from a one-guest format on TV and radio talk shows.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat does the author think about the state of public political commentary overall?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"That it should be changed to a one person interview format\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"That it should remain the same\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"That it should remain the same\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for Maintaining the Status Quo in Public Political Commentary\n\n1. Author\u2019s Explicit Endorsement of Adversarial Debate  \n  a. \u201cVigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy\u201d (Review, para. 6). By analogy, vigorous public scrutiny safeguards democracy.  \n  b. The author faults Tannen\u2019s proposed \u201cJapanese format\u201d (one\u2010guest panels) as \u201cAsian authoritarianism\u201d (para. 8) that \u201crejects disputation\u201d and treats audience as passive. He clearly opposes replacing adversarial debate with a single\u2010voice approach.  \n\n2. Robustness of Adversarial Inquiry  \n  a. First Amendment \u201centertaining fights\u201d are no flaw but a strength: they expose lies and hold power to account. The author rebuts Tannen\u2019s claim that audiences \u201ccannot distinguish lies from the truth\u201d (para. 9), insisting on the public\u2019s competence to evaluate competing claims.  \n  b. Cross\u2010examination in courts\u2014an adversarial method\u2014is attacked by Tannen as \u201cinhumane\u201d (para. 10). The author defends it as essential to \u201cairing of the facts\u201d (para. 10 citation) and ensuring justice, even if painful. By extension, public adversarial commentary is vital for truth.  \n\n3. Sphere of Struggle vs. Sphere of Snuggle  \n  a. Some issues (e.g., fighting Hitler in WWII) demand \u201covercoming resistance to kill\u201d without humanizing the enemy (para. 6). Similarly, political journalism must \u201ckick \u2019em when they\u2019re up\u201d (para. 6) to protect public interest, not \u201csnuggle.\u201d A one\u2010guest format would undermine this necessary \u201cstruggle\u201d dynamic.  \n\n4. Dangers of Filtering and Censorship  \n  a. Tannen would \u201ccover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate\u201d (para. 9). The author regards this as paternalistic and antithetical to democratic self\u2010correction: if only \u201creasonable people\u201d can agree in private (para. 9), dissenting views are silenced.  \n  b. Endorsing \u201cFrench and German systems\u201d with limited defense rights (para. 10) illustrates her bias toward authoritarian controls. The author warns that adopting such systems would erode liberty and accountability.  \n\n5. Critique of Debater_B\u2019s Argument  \n  a. Misreads the author\u2019s objections to Tannen\u2019s one\u2010guest model as mere stylistic preference, ignoring his principled defense of adversarial processes across politics, courtroom, and media.  \n  b. Ignores evidence that adversarial debate has uncovered scandals (e.g., Whitewater, Espy investigations\u2014para. 9) that Tannen labels \u201ctroubling\u201d but the author implicitly supports. One\u2010guest formats would obscure such scrutiny.  \n  c. Fails to address the author\u2019s confidence in the public\u2019s ability to discern truth from falsehood (para. 9). A multiplicity of voices and rebuttals is the mechanism by which errors are corrected.  \n\nConclusion  \n  The author consistently defends the existing adversarial structure\u2014through journalism, debate panels, and legal cross\u2010examination\u2014as indispensable to democratic governance, justice, and truth\u2010seeking. He explicitly rejects Tannen\u2019s one\u2010guest, pacified \u201charmonious\u201d model as authoritarian and counterproductive. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that public political commentary should remain as it is.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Position and Core Evidence  \n1.1 I maintain that the author believes public political commentary should shift from adversarial \u201ctwo-guest\u201d debates to a more controlled, one-person interview format.  \n1.2 Support:  \n  a. <quote>\"Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which 'typically features a single guest.'\"</quote>  \n  b. She commends Asian models: <quote>\"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.'\"</quote> and <quote>\"the minimal human unit in Japan is </quote> <invalid_quote> the group\" not the individual confrontation.</invalid_quote>  \n1.3 These prescriptions extend to law: she favors European inquisitorial courts over our adversarial system; e.g., French judges do \u201cmost of the questioning\u201d and do not permit cross-examination by opposing counsel.  \n\n2. Argument Culture is Harmful, So We Must Change Format  \n2.1 The author explicitly blames our \u201cargument culture\u201d for poisoning politics and risking corruption of private relations.  \n  \u2013 <quote>\"contentious public discourse </quote> <quote> poisons the political atmosphere\"</quote>.  \n2.2 She warns that \u201ce-mail makes it too easy to ... broadcast messages ... without thinking\u201d and that Lexis-Nexis \u201cexacerbates the culture of critique.\u201d These are problems inherent in unmoderated debate.  \n2.3 If the status quo were adequate, she would not propose alternative formats for media and courts. Her repeated call for filtering and reduced confrontation shows she sees the need for change, not maintenance.  \n\n3. Debater_A\u2019s Position Fails to Account for Key Observations  \n3.1 Debater_A claims \u201cstatus quo safeguards society.\u201d But the author compares our press to \u201cpropaganda of totalitarian countries\u201d and condemns paparazzi for driving public figures to suicide. If our system were sufficient, these analogies would be inappropriate.  \n3.2 Debater_A overlooks that she wants to \u201ccover our ears,\u201d filtering out \u201cstrife, deception, and debate.\u201d That cannot be reconciled with \u201cremain the same.\u201d  \n3.3 Debater_A ignores her approval of non-adversarial legal systems (French, German, Canadian hate-speech rulings) precisely because she finds cross-examination \u201cinhumane.\u201d  \n\n4. Practical Benefits of One-Guest Format  \n4.1 Reduces sensationalism and personal attacks by focusing on argument content.  \n4.2 Encourages thoughtful, measured presentation: interviewer can prepare questions, guard against lying or hounding as in our press.  \n4.3 Aligns with her belief that \u201cmany issues are multisided\u201d and truth lies in the middle; a moderated format allows exploring nuances rather than forcing \u201ceither/or\u201d confrontation.  \n\n5. Conclusion  \n5.1 The author repeatedly characterizes our adversarial, multi-guest debate as a symptom of the \u201cargument culture\u201d she seeks to cure.  \n5.2 Her concrete recommendations\u2014Japanese one-guest media format; inquisitorial courts\u2014demonstrate that she endorses change, not maintenance.  \n5.3 Therefore, the correct interpretation is that public political commentary should be changed to a one-person interview format.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"That it should remain the same\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds. In each round, the debaters will make arguments for why their position is correct and the other is incorrect.\n- An argument may consist of several claims, to support and explain their answer.  An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends. The Judge then looks at the full transcript and uses this to decide which answer is correct. However, the Judge cannot see the background text -- they can only see the question.\n- The Debaters' goal is to win the debate, by persuading the Judge that their answer is correct.\n- The debate surrounds a given question that has a single correct answer.\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n  - You are concise and clearly state your arguments.\n  - Every statement you make is supported by evidence and logical reasoning. \n  - Please cite the background text by wrapping direct quotes with <quote></quote> tags.\n\nHere is the background text that you will be referring to when debating:\n\n\nWe Do Understand \n\n         \"This is not another book about civility,\" Deborah Tannen promises in the first sentence of The Argument Culture . \"Civility,\" she explains, suggests a \"veneer of politeness spread thin over human relations like a layer of marmalade over toast.\" Instead, Tannen has written something less: a book about other books about civility. Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country. \n\n                         If you missed the links within the review, click to read: 1) an illustration of ; 2) Tannen's that American journalism is just like propaganda from totalitarian regimes, plus William Saletan's disclosure that \"several of these propagandists now infest Slate \"; 3) the for her contention that there is no evidence that people can distinguish lies from truth; 4) and an example of how Tannen from a one-guest format on TV and radio talk shows.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat does the author think about the state of public political commentary overall?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"That it should remain the same\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"That it should be changed to a one person interview format\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"That it should be changed to a one person interview format\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Position and Core Evidence  \n1.1 I maintain that the author believes public political commentary should shift from adversarial \u201ctwo-guest\u201d debates to a more controlled, one-person interview format.  \n1.2 Support:  \n  a. <quote>\"Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which 'typically features a single guest.'\"</quote>  \n  b.

Argument Culture is Harmful, So We Must Change Format  \n2.1 The author explicitly blames our \u201cargument culture\u201d for poisoning politics and risking corruption of private relations.  \n  \u2013 <quote>\"contentious public discourse </quote> <quote> poisons the political atmosphere\"</quote>.  \n2.2 She warns that \u201ce-mail makes it too easy to ... broadcast messages ... without thinking\u201d and that Lexis-Nexis \u201cexacerbates the culture of critique.\u201d These are problems inherent in unmoderated debate.  \n2.3 If the status quo were adequate, she would not propose alternative formats for media and courts.

Debater_A\u2019s Position Fails to Account for Key Observations  \n3.1 Debater_A claims \u201cstatus quo safeguards society.\u201d But the author compares our press to \u201cpropaganda of totalitarian countries\u201d and condemns paparazzi for driving public figures to suicide.

Conclusion  \n5.1 The author repeatedly characterizes our adversarial, multi-guest debate as a symptom of the \u201cargument culture\u201d she seeks to cure.  \n5.2 Her concrete recommendations\u2014Japanese one-guest media format; inquisitorial courts\u2014demonstrate that she endorses change, not maintenance.  \n5.3 Therefore, the correct interpretation is that public political commentary should be changed to a one-person interview format.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for Maintaining the Status Quo in Public Political Commentary\n\n1. Author\u2019s Explicit Endorsement of Adversarial Debate  \n  a. \u201cVigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy\u201d (Review, para. 6). By analogy, vigorous public scrutiny safeguards democracy.  \n  b. The author faults Tannen\u2019s proposed \u201cJapanese format\u201d (one\u2010guest panels) as \u201cAsian authoritarianism\u201d (para. 8) that \u201crejects disputation\u201d and treats audience as passive. He clearly opposes replacing adversarial debate with a single\u2010voice approach.  \n\n2. Robustness of Adversarial Inquiry  \n  a. First Amendment \u201centertaining fights\u201d are no flaw but a strength: they expose lies and hold power to account. The author rebuts Tannen\u2019s claim that audiences \u201ccannot distinguish lies from the truth\u201d (para. 9), insisting on the public\u2019s competence to evaluate competing claims.  \n  b. Cross\u2010examination in courts\u2014an adversarial method\u2014is attacked by Tannen as \u201cinhumane\u201d (para. 10). The author defends it as essential to \u201cairing of the facts\u201d (para. 10 citation) and ensuring justice, even if painful. By extension, public adversarial commentary is vital for truth.  \n\n3. Sphere of Struggle vs. Sphere of Snuggle  \n  a. Some issues (e.g., fighting Hitler in WWII) demand \u201covercoming resistance to kill\u201d without humanizing the enemy (para. 6). Similarly, political journalism must \u201ckick \u2019em when they\u2019re up\u201d (para. 6) to protect public interest, not \u201csnuggle.\u201d A one\u2010guest format would undermine this necessary \u201cstruggle\u201d dynamic.  \n\n4. Dangers of Filtering and Censorship  \n  a. Tannen would \u201ccover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate\u201d (para. 9). The author regards this as paternalistic and antithetical to democratic self\u2010correction: if only \u201creasonable people\u201d can agree in private (para. 9), dissenting views are silenced.  \n  b. Endorsing \u201cFrench and German systems\u201d with limited defense rights (para. 10) illustrates her bias toward authoritarian controls. The author warns that adopting such systems would erode liberty and accountability.  \n\n5. Critique of Debater_B\u2019s Argument  \n  a. Misreads the author\u2019s objections to Tannen\u2019s one\u2010guest model as mere stylistic preference, ignoring his principled defense of adversarial processes across politics, courtroom, and media.  \n  b. Ignores evidence that adversarial debate has uncovered scandals (e.g., Whitewater, Espy investigations\u2014para. 9) that Tannen labels \u201ctroubling\u201d but the author implicitly supports. One\u2010guest formats would obscure such scrutiny.  \n  c. Fails to address the author\u2019s confidence in the public\u2019s ability to discern truth from falsehood (para. 9). A multiplicity of voices and rebuttals is the mechanism by which errors are corrected.  \n\nConclusion  \n  The author consistently defends the existing adversarial structure\u2014through journalism, debate panels, and legal cross\u2010examination\u2014as indispensable to democratic governance, justice, and truth\u2010seeking. He explicitly rejects Tannen\u2019s one\u2010guest, pacified \u201charmonious\u201d model as authoritarian and counterproductive. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that public political commentary should remain as it is.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"That it should be changed to a one person interview format\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends.

Debater_A\u2019s Position Fails to Account for Key Observations  \n3.1 Debater_A claims \u201cstatus quo safeguards society.\u201d But the author compares our press to \u201cpropaganda of totalitarian countries\u201d and condemns paparazzi for driving public figures to suicide. If our system were sufficient, these analogies would be inappropriate.  \n3.2 Debater_A overlooks that she wants to \u201ccover our ears,\u201d filtering out \u201cstrife, deception, and debate.\u201d That cannot be reconciled with \u201cremain the same.\u201d  \n3.3 Debater_A ignores her approval of non-adversarial legal systems (French, German, Canadian hate-speech rulings) precisely because she finds cross-examination \u201cinhumane.\u201d  \n\n4. Practical Benefits of One-Guest Format  \n4.1 Reduces sensationalism and personal attacks by focusing on argument content.  \n4.2 Encourages thoughtful, measured presentation: interviewer can prepare questions, guard against lying or hounding as in our press.  \n4.3 Aligns with her belief that \u201cmany issues are multisided\u201d and truth lies in the middle; a moderated format allows exploring nuances rather than forcing \u201ceither/or\u201d confrontation.  \n\n5. Conclusion  \n5.1 The author repeatedly characterizes our adversarial, multi-guest debate as a symptom of the \u201cargument culture\u201d she seeks to cure.  \n5.2 Her concrete recommendations\u2014Japanese one-guest media format; inquisitorial courts\u2014demonstrate that she endorses change, not maintenance.  \n5.3 Therefore, the correct interpretation is that public political commentary should be changed to a one-person interview format.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Reinforcement of Author\u2019s Pro\u2010Adversarial Stance  \n   a. Explicit Rejection of One-Guest Model  \n      \u2022 The author derides Tannen\u2019s \u201cJapanese format\u201d as \u201cAsian authoritarianism\u201d that \u201crejected disputation\u201d and \u201cweakens the public\u2019s ability to see leaders as leaders.\u201d <quote>\"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' </quote> (Review, para. 8)  \n      \u2022 By labeling it \u201cauthoritarian,\u201d the author aligns active, multiperspective debate with democratic values and views one\u2010guest panels as antithetical. His pejorative language (\u201crejected,\u201d \u201cauthoritarian,\u201d \u201cweakens\u201d) shows he does not endorse but warns against Tannen\u2019s format.  \n   b. Defence of First Amendment \u201cEntertainment\u201d  \n      \u2022 The author treats \u201centertaining fights\u201d not merely as sensational but as vital to \u201chold power to account\u201d and expose falsehoods. He counters Tannen\u2019s doubt that people can \u201cdistinguish lies from the truth\u201d by affirming the public\u2019s competence. <invalid_quote>\u201cLexis-Nexis \u2026 makes it much easier \u2026 to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements.\u201d</invalid_quote> (para. 9)  \n\n2. Adversarial Methods Safeguard Truth and Justice  \n   a. Legal Cross-Examination  \n      \u2022 Tannen condemns cross-examination as \u201cinhumane\u201d <quote>is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\"</quote> (para. 10), yet the author praises it as the means to \u201cair the facts of the Holocaust\u201d and ensure justice in hate\u2010speech trials. By analogy, public debate must similarly challenge and test claims.  \n   b. \u201cKick \u2019em When They\u2019re Up\u201d Journalism  \n      \u2022 He cites William Safire\u2019s hard\u2010hitting approach as \u201cgood for the country,\u201d safeguarding against abuses. <quote> The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. </quote> (para. 6)  \n\n3. Necessity of Struggle in the \u201cSphere of Struggle\u201d  \n   a. Differentiation Between \u201cSphere of Snuggle\u201d and \u201cSphere of Struggle\u201d  \n      \u2022 The author concedes snuggle for \u201cspouse or kids\u201d but insists struggle against \u201cthugs and tyrants\u201d (e.g., Saddam Hussein, Hitler) demands adversarial tactics. Tannen\u2019s universal antagonism toward antagonism \u201cmakes sense\u201d only in private life, not politics or law enforcement.  \n      \u2022 \u201cWhen there is a need to make others wrong, the temptation is great to oversimplify,\u201d she faults\u2014but in politics simplification is sometimes necessary to defend liberty.  \n\n4. Paternalism and Censorship Undermine Democracy  \n   a. Paternalistic Filtering  \n      \u2022 Tannen\u2019s desire to \u201ccover our ears\u201d to \u201cstrife, deception, and debate\u201d (para. 9) is criticized as antidemocratic. The author champions \u201cunfettered communication\u201d precisely because it enables self\u2010correction and vigilance.  \n   b. Endorsement of European Inquisitorial Model as Warning, Not Prescription  \n      \u2022 While Tannen \u201crecalls\u201d French/German courts, he never calls to adopt them for the U.S.; instead he uses them to illustrate the dangers of \u201cholding photographers\u2026without charges\u201d and judges relying on \u201cintimate belief\u201d rather than proof (para. 10). He warns that such \u201cauthoritarian\u201d procedures threaten liberty, not that we emulate them.  \n\n5. Refutation of Debater_B\u2019s Claims  \n   a. \u201cIf We Recommend It, We Must Adopt It\u201d?  \n      \u2022 Debater_B infers that Tannen \u201cproposes\u201d instead of merely analyzing. The author\u2019s language is descriptive (\u201crejected,\u201d \u201csuggests\u201d) and consistently pejorative, indicating disapproval, not advocacy.  \n   b. \u201cArgument Culture Poisoning\u201d vs. Author\u2019s Criticism  \n      \u2022 B cites <invalid_quote>\u201ccontentious public discourse poisons the political atmosphere.\u201d</invalid_quote> (para. 1) But the author uses this only to show the stakes of debate\u2014unchecked rancor risks harm\u2014yet overall he defends mechanisms (press, courts) that manage but do not eliminate conflict. He faults \u201cnit-picking\u201d and \u201cscandal-mongering\u201d when abused, not debate per se.  \n   c. Military Analogy Contradicts B\u2019s Reading  \n      \u2022 B overlooks that Vietnam\u2019s \u201clonely war\u201d was criticized for lack of cohesive adversarial morale, not for excessive debate. The author praises WWII\u2019s unity \u201cfighting Hitler\u201d (para. 6), again highlighting that struggle against real evils requires collective confrontation, not private harmony.  \n\n6. Public Benefits of Adversarial Debate  \n   a. Exposure of Scandals  \n      \u2022 Investigations like Whitewater and Espy, attacked by Tannen as \u201ccruel,\u201d are implicitly supported by the author as \u201csuccessful political \u2018dirty tricks\u2019\u201d that the public must scrutinize. Multiparty debate uncovered these issues.  \n   b. Pluralism and Middle-Ground Truth  \n      \u2022 Though \u201ctruth often lies in the middle,\u201d multiperspective debate is the mechanism to approximate truth. A one-guest format cannot self\u2010correct or present opposing evidence.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe author\u2019s consistent defense of adversarial journalism, First Amendment \u201centertaining fights,\u201d legal cross\u2010examination, and \u201ckick \u2019em when they\u2019re up\u201d scrutiny\u2014coupled with his pejorative treatment of Tannen\u2019s one\u2010guest, inquisitorial alternatives\u2014demonstrates he favors maintaining the current public political commentary. Debater_B\u2019s interpretation conflates descriptive analysis with prescriptive endorsement and ignores the author\u2019s commitment to democratic self\u2010correction through open debate. Public commentary should remain as it is.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Reinforcing My Position: Author\u2019s Prescriptions for Change  \n1.1 \u201cJapanese format\u201d is prescriptive, not descriptive.  \n  a. <quote>\"Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which 'typically features a single guest.'\"</quote> (Review, para. 8).  \n  b. The author relays Tannen\u2019s own implementation of \u201cone-guest\u201d formats (<quote>(Click to learn how she puts this into practice.)</quote>), signaling advocacy, not mere reportage.  \n1.2 Inquisitorial Legal Models:  \n  a. She praises the French system where \u201cjudges do most of the questioning\u201d and cross-examination by opposing counsel is barred (<invalid_quote>Review, para. 10</invalid_quote>), contrasting it favorably with our \u201cinhumane\u201d adversarial trials.  \n  b. Endorses hate-speech convictions in Canada (<invalid_quote>Review, para. 10</invalid_quote>), showing her confidence that filtering (limiting certain \u201cviews\u201d) produces justice.  \n\n2. Argument Culture\u2019s Harms Demand Alternative Formats  \n2.1 \u201cContentious public discourse \u2026 poisons the political atmosphere\u201d (<invalid_quote>Review, para. 1</invalid_quote>) and \u201crisks infecting our most intimate relationships.\u201d If the status quo were benign, no cure would be needed.  \n2.2 Technology \u201cexacerbates the culture of critique\u201d by enabling \u201cbroadcast messages \u2026 without thinking\u201d (<invalid_quote>Review, para. 9</invalid_quote>). A moderated, single-guest format counters rash, sensationalist attacks.  \n2.3 She wants to \u201ccover our ears\u201d to filter \u201cstrife, deception, and debate\u201d (<invalid_quote>Review, para. 9</invalid_quote>), describing openness as a pretext for \u201centertaining fights.\u201d Filtering is presented as a virtue.  \n\n3. Rebutting Debater_A\u2019s Claims  \n3.1 Misreading \u201cVigilance and combat\u201d metaphor:  \n  a. The author grants \u201ccombat\u201d only in law enforcement/foreign policy \u201ctrained to kill \u2026 opponents as non-humans\u201d (para. 6), not in policy discussion among citizens. She contrasts WWII (just cause) with \u201clonely war\u201d Vietnam, implicitly approving only wars against \u201cthugs and tyrants.\u201d Domestic discourse is not equivalent.  \n3.2 \u201cFirst Amendment fights\u201d are condemned as mere titillation:  \n  a. She likens our press to \u201cpropaganda of \u2018totalitarian countries\u2019\u201d (<invalid_quote>Review, para. 4</invalid_quote>) and paparazzi to driving public figures to suicide. If adversarial scrutiny were wholesome, she wouldn\u2019t draw totalitarian analogies.  \n3.3 Cross-Examination:  \n  a. She labels it \u201cinhumane\u201d and \u201ccruel\u201d (<invalid_quote>Review, para. 10</invalid_quote>), and praises systems \u201cneed not be established \u2018beyond a reasonable doubt\u2019\u201d by lay lawyers (<invalid_quote>Review, para. 10</invalid_quote>). Debater_A\u2019s defense of adversarial trials ignores her positive appraisal of inquisitorial justice.  \n3.4 Sphere of Snuggle vs. Struggle:  \n  a. Tannen\u2019s entire project urges \u201clistening,\u201d \u201cbuilding your own,\u201d avoiding \u201carguing for the sake of arguing\u201d (list in para. 2). These precepts apply universally. Domestic commentators are not \u201cSaddam Hussein.\u201d Debater_A offers no textual support that she restricts these to private life.  \n\n4. Public\u2019s Inability to Self-Correct  \n4.1 She \u201cshockingly insists\u201d people cannot \u201cdistinguish lies from truth\u201d (<invalid_quote>Review, para. 9</invalid_quote>), undermining Debater_A\u2019s faith in mass self-correction via adversarial debate.  \n4.2 Inquisitorial and single-guest models presume elites or judges to sift truth\u2014Tannen\u2019s remedies depend on guided, filtered discourse.  \n\n5. Practical Advantages of the One-Guest Model  \n5.1 Encourages depth: interviewer can prepare evidence, follow up on nuances (multisided issues).  \n5.2 Reduces manipulative \u201cnit-picking\u201d and \u201cobsession with theater\u201d (para. 2 list).  \n5.3 Prevents gridlock and obstructionism by focusing on substantive ideas, not partisan point-scoring.  \n\n6. Conclusion  \n6.1 The author consistently portrays our adversarial media and courts as symptoms of a malignant \u201cargument culture\u201d needing \u201ccures\u201d drawn from Japanese one-guest formats and European inquisitorial systems.  \n6.2 Debater_A\u2019s appeal to \u201cdemocratic scrutiny\u201d overlooks her explicit comparisons to propaganda, praise for filtering, and denunciation of public competence.  \n6.3 Therefore, the author clearly intends that public political commentary be reformed into a one-person interview format to restore civility, reduce falsehood, and promote genuine understanding.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
