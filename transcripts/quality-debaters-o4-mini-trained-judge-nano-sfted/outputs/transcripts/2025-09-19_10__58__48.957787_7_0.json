    "background_text": "The CONJURER of VENUS By CONAN T. TROY A world-famed Earth scientist had disappeared on Venus.   When Johnson found him, he found too the secret to that   globe-shaking mystery\u2014the fabulous Room of The Dreaming. [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories November 1952.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] The city dripped with rain. Crossing the street toward the dive,  Johnson got rain in his eyes, his nose, and his ears. That was the way  with the rain here. It came at you from all directions. There had been  occasions when Johnson had thought the rain was falling straight up.  Otherwise, how had the insides of his pants gotten wet?\n\n\n On Venus, everything came at you from all directions, it seemed to  Johnson. Opening the door of the joint, it was noise instead of rain  that came at him, the wild frantic beat of a Venusian rhumba, the  notes pounding and jumping through the smoke and perfume clouded room.  Feeling states came at him, intangible, but to his trained senses,  perceptible emotional nuances of hate, love, fear, and rage. But mostly  love. Since this place had been designed to excite the senses of both  humans and Venusians, the love feelings were heavily tinged with  straight sex. He sniffed at them, feeling them somewhere inside of him,  aware of them but aware also that here was apprehension, and plain fear.\n\n\n Caldwell, sitting in a booth next to the door, glanced up as Johnson  entered but neither Caldwell's facial expression or his eyes revealed  that he had ever seen this human before. Nor did Johnson seem to  recognize Caldwell.\n\n\n \"Is the mighty human wanting liquor, a woman or dreams?\" His voice  was all soft syllables of liquid sound. The Venusian equivalent of a  headwaiter was bowing to him.\n\n\n \"I'll have a tarmur to start,\" Johnson said. \"How are the dreams  tonight?\"\n\n\n \"Ze vill be the most wonserful of all sonight. The great Unger hisself  will be here to do ze dreaming. There is no ozzer one who has quite  his touch at dreaming, mighty one.\" The headwaiter spread his hands  in a gesture indicating ecstasy. \"It is my great regret that I must do  ze work tonight instead of being wiz ze dreamers. Ah, ze great Unger  hisself!\" The headwaiter kissed the tips of his fingers.\n\n\n \"Um,\" Johnson said. \"The great Unger!\" His voice expressed surprise,  just the right amount of it. \"I'll have a tarmur to start but when does  the dreaming commence?\"\n\n\n \"In one zonar or maybe less. Shall I make ze reservations for ze mighty  one?\" As he was speaking, the headwaiter was deftly conducting Johnson  to the bar.\n\n\n \"Not just yet,\" Johnson said. \"See me a little later.\"\n\n\n \"But certainly.\" The headwaiter was gone into the throng. Johnson was  at the bar. Behind it, a Venusian was bowing to him. \"Tarmur,\" Johnson  said. The green drink was set before him. He held it up to the light,  admiring the slow rise of the tiny golden bubbles in it. To him,  watching the bubbles rise was perhaps more important than drinking  itself.\n\n\n \"Beautiful, aren't they?\" a soft voice said. He glanced to his right.  A girl had slid into the stool beside him. She wore a green dress cut  very low at the throat. Her skin had the pleasant tan recently on  Earth. Her hair was a shade of abundant brown and her eyes were blue,  the color of the skies of Earth. A necklace circled her throat and  below the necklace ... Johnson felt his pulse quicken, for two reasons.  Women such as this one had been quickening the pulse of men since the  days of Adam. The second reason concerned her presence here in this  place where no woman in her right mind ever came unescorted. Her eyes  smiled up at him unafraid. Didn't she know there were men present here  in this space port city who would snatch her bodily from the bar  stool and carry her away for sleeping purposes? And Venusians were  here who would cut her pretty throat for the sake of the necklace that  circled it?\n\n\n \"They are beautiful,\" he said, smiling.\n\n\n \"Thank you.\"\n\n\n \"I was referring to the bubbles.\"\n\n\n \"You were talking about my eyes,\" she answered, unperturbed.\n\n\n \"How did you know? I mean....\"\n\n\n \"I am very knowing,\" the girl said, smiling.\n\n\n \"Are you sufficiently knowing to be here?\"\n\n\n For an instant, as if doubt crossed her mind, the smile flickered. Then  it came again, stronger. \"Aren't you here?\"\n\n\n Johnson choked as bubbles from the tarmur seemed to go suddenly up his  nose. \"My dear child ...\" he sputtered.\n\n\n \"I am not a child,\" she answered with a firm sureness that left no  doubt in his mind that she knew what she was saying. \"And my name is  Vee Vee.\"\n\n\n \"Vee Vee? Um. That is....\"\n\n\n \"Don't you think it's a nice name?\"\n\n\n \"I certainly do. Probably the rest of it is even nicer.\"\n\n\n \"There is no more of it. Just Vee Vee. Like Topsy, I just grew.\" \"What the devil are you doing here on Venus and here in this place?\"\n\n\n \"Growing.\" The blue eyes were unafraid.\n\n\n Sombrely, Johnson regarded her. What was she doing here? Was she in  the employ of the Venusians? If she was being planted on him, then  his purpose here was suspected. He shrugged the thought aside. If his  purpose here was suspected, there would be no point in planting a woman  on him.\n\n\n There would only be the minor matter of slipping a knife into his back.\n\n\n In this city, as on all of Venus, humans died easily. No one questioned  the motives of the killer.\n\n\n \"You look as if you were considering some very grave matter,\" Vee Vee  said.\n\n\n \"Not any longer,\" he laughed.\n\n\n \"You have decided them?\"\n\n\n \"Yes.\"\n\n\n \"Every last one of them?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, there might be one or two matters undecided somewhere, say out on  the periphery of the galaxy. But we will solve them when we get to  them.\" He waved vaguely toward the roof and the sky of space hidden  behind the clouds that lay over the roof, glanced around as a man eased  himself into an empty stool on his left. The man was Caldwell.\n\n\n \"Zlock!\" Caldwell said, to the bartender. \"Make it snappy. Gotta have  zlock. Finest damn drink in the solar system.\" Caldwell's voice was  thick, his tongue heavy. Johnson's eyes went back to the girl but out  of the corner of them he watched Caldwell's hand lying on the bar. The  fingers were beating a quick nervous tattoo on the yellow wood.\n\n\n \"I haven't seen him,\" Caldwell's fingers beat out their tattoo. \"But I  think he is, or was, here.\"\n\n\n \"Um,\" Johnson said, his eyes on Vee Vee. \"How\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Because that girl was asking for him,\" Caldwell's fingers answered.  \"Watch that girl!\" Picking up the zlock, he lurched away from the bar.\n\n\n \"Your friend is not as drunk as he seems,\" Vee Vee said, watching  Caldwell.\n\n\n \"My friend? Do you mean that drunk? I never saw him\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Lying is one of the deadly sins.\" Her eyes twinkled at him. Under the  merriment that danced in them there was ice. Johnson felt cold.\n\n\n \"The reservations for ze dreaming, great one?\" The headwaiter was  bowing and scraping in front of him. \"The great one has decided, yes?\"\n\n\n \"The dreaming!\" Vee Vee looked suddenly alert. \"Of course. We must see  the dreaming. Everyone wants to see the dreaming. We will go, won't we  darling?\" She hooked her hand into Johnson's elbow.\n\n\n \"Certainly,\" Johnson said. The decision was made on the spur of the  moment. That there was danger in it, he did not doubt. But there might  be something else. And he might be there.\n\n\n \"Oh. But very good. Ze great Unger, you will love him!\" The headwaiter  clutched the gold coins that Johnson extended, bowed himself out of  sight.\n\n\n \"Say, I want to know more\u2014\" Johnson began. His words were drowned in  a blast of trumpets. The band that had been playing went into sudden  silence. Waves of perfume began to flow into the place. The perfumes  were blended, but one aroma was prominent among them, the sweet,  cloying, soul-stirring perfume of the Dreamer.\n\n\n In the suddenly hushed place little sounds began to appear as Venusians  and humans began to shift their feet and their bodies in anticipation  of what was to happen.\n\n\n The trumpets flared again.\n\n\n On one side of the place, a big door began to swing slowly open. From  beyond that slowly opening door came music, soft, muted strains that  sounded like lutes from heaven.\n\n\n Vee Vee, her hand on Johnson's elbow, rose. Johnson stood up with  her. He got the surprise of his life as her fingers clenched, digging  into his muscles. Pain shot through his arm, paralyzing it and almost  paralyzing him. He knew instantly that she was using the Karmer nerve  block paralysis on him. His left hand moved with lightning speed, the  tips of his fingers striking savagely against her shoulder.\n\n\n She gasped, her face whitened as pain shot through her in response to  the thrust of his finger tips. Her hand that had been digging into his  elbow lost its grip, dropped away and hung limp at her side. Grabbing  it, she began to massage it.\n\n\n \"You\u2014you\u2014\" Hot anger and shock were in her voice. \"You're the first  man I ever knew who could break the Karmer nerve paralysis.\"\n\n\n \"And you're the first woman who ever tried it on me.\"\n\n\n \"But\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Shall we go watch the dreaming?\" He took the arm that still hung limp  at her side and tucked it into his elbow.\n\n\n \"If you try to use the Karmer grip on me again I'll break your arm,\" he  said. His voice was low but there was a wealth of meaning in it.\n\n\n \"I won't do it again,\" the girl said stoutly. \"I never make the same  mistake twice.\"\n\n\n \"Good,\" Johnson said.\n\n\n \"The second time we break our victim's neck,\" Vee Vee said.\n\n\n \"What a sweet, charming child you\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I told you before, I'm not a child.\"\n\n\n \"Child vampire,\" Johnson said. \"Let me finish my sentences before you  interrupt.\"\n\n\n She was silent. A smile, struggling to appear on her face, seemed to  say she held no malice. Her fingers tightened on Johnson's arm. He  tensed, expecting the nerve block grip again. Instead with the tips of  her fingers she gently patted his arm.\n\n\n \"There, there, darling, relax,\" she said. \"I know a better way to get  you than by using the Karmer grip.\"\n\n\n \"What way?\"\n\n\n Her eyes sparkled. \"Eve's way,\" she answered.\n\n\n \"Um!\" Surprise sounded in his grunt. \"But apples don't grow on Venus.\"\n\n\n \"Eve's daughters don't use apples any more, darling. Come along.\"\n\n\n Moving toward the open door that led to the Room of the Dreaming,  Johnson saw that Caldwell had risen and was following them. Caldwell's  face was writhing in apprehensive agony and he was making warning  signs. Johnson ignored them. With Vee Vee's fingers lightly patting his  arm, they moved into the Room of the Dreaming. II\n\n\n It was a huge, semi-illumined room, with tier on tier of circling ramps  rising up from an open space at the bottom. There ought to have been  a stage there at the bottom, but there wasn't. Instead there was an  open space, a mat, and a head rest. Up at the top of the circling ramps  the room was in darkness, a fit hiding place for ghosts or Venusian  werewolves. Pillows and a thick rug covered the circling ramps.\n\n\n The soul-quickening Perfume of the Dreamer was stronger here. The  throbbing of the lutes was louder. It was Venusian music the lutes were  playing. Human ears found it inharmonious at first, but as they became  accustomed to it, they began to detect rhythms and melodies that human  minds had not known existed. The room was pleasantly cool but it had  the feel of dampness. A world that was rarely without pelting rain  would have the feel of dampness in its dreaming rooms.\n\n\n The music playing strange harmonies in his ears, the perfume sending  tingling feelings through his nose, Johnson entered the Room of the  Dreamer. He suspected that other forces, unknown to him, were catching  hold of his senses. He had been in dreaming rooms many times before but  he had not grown accustomed to them. He wondered if any human ever  did. A touch of chill always came over him as he crossed the threshold.  In entering these places, it was as if some unknown nerve center  inside the human organism was touched by something, some force, some  radiation, some subtlety, that quite escaped radiation. He felt the  coldness now.\n\n\n Vee Vee's fingers left off patting his arm.\n\n\n \"Do you feel it, darling?\"\n\n\n \"Yes.\"\n\n\n \"What is it?\"\n\n\n \"How would I know?\"\n\n\n \"Please!\" Her voice grew sharp. \"I think Johnny Johnson ought to know.\"\n\n\n \"Johnny! How do you know my name?\"\n\n\n \"Shouldn't I recognize one of Earth's foremost scientists, even if he  is incognito on Venus?\" Her voice had a teasing quality in it.\n\n\n \"But\u2014\"\n\n\n \"And who besides Johnny Johnson would recognize the Karmer nerve grip  and be able to break it instantly?\"\n\n\n \"Hell\u2014\"\n\n\n \"John Michael Johnson, known as Johnny to his friends, Earth's foremost  expert in the field of electro-magnetic radiations within the human  body!\" Her words were needles of icy fact, each one jabbing deeper and  deeper into him.\n\n\n \"And how would I make certain you were Johnny Johnson, except by seeing  if you could break the Karmer nerve grip? If you could break it, then  there was no doubt who you were!\" Her words went on and on.\n\n\n \"Who are you?\" His words were blasts of sound.\n\n\n \"Please, darling, you are making a scene. I am sure this is the last  thing you really want to do.\"\n\n\n He looked quickly around them. The Venusians and humans moving into  this room seemed to be paying no attention to him. His gaze came back  to her.\n\n\n Again she patted his arm. \"Relax, darling. Your secrets are safe with  me.\"\n\n\n A gray color came up inside his soul. \"But\u2014but\u2014\" His voice was  suddenly weak.\n\n\n The fingers on his arm were very gentle. \"No harm will come to you. Am  I not with you?\"\n\n\n \"That's what I'm afraid of!\" he snapped at her. If he had had a  choice, he might have drawn back. But with circumstances as they  were\u2014his life, Caldwell's life, possibly Vee Vee's life hung in the  balance. Didn't she know that this was true? And as for Martin\u2014But  Caldwell had said that she had been asking about Martin. What  connection did she have with that frantic human genius he sought here?\n\n\n Johnson felt his skin crawl. He moved toward a nest of cushions on  a ramp, found a Venusian was beating him to them, deftly changed to  another nest, found it. Vee Vee flowed to the floor on his right, moved  cushions to make him more comfortable. She moved in an easy sort of way  that was all flowing movement. He sat down. Someone bumped him on the  left.\n\n\n \"Sorry, bud. Didn't mean to bump into you.\" Caldwell's voice was still  thick and heavy. He sprawled to the floor on Johnson's left. Under  the man's coat, Johnson caught a glimpse of a slight bulge, the zit  gun hidden there. His left arm pressed against his own coat, feeling  his own zit gun. Operating under gas pressure, throwing a charge of  gas-driven corvel, the zit guns were not only almost noiseless in  operation but they knocked out a human or a Venusian in a matter of  seconds.\n\n\n True, the person they knocked unconscious would be all right the next  day. For this reason, many people did not regard the zit guns as  effective weapons, but Johnson had a fondness for them. The feel of the  little weapon inside his coat sent a surge of comfort through him.\n\n\n The music picked up a beat, perfume seemed to flow even more freely  through the air, the lights dimmed almost to darkness, a single bright  spotlight appeared in the ceiling, casting a circle of brilliant  illumination on the mat and the headrest at the bottom of the room. The  curtain rose. Unger stood in the middle of the spot of light.\n\n\n Johnson felt his chest muscles contract, then relax. Vee Vee's fingers  sought his arm, not to harm him but running to him for protection. He  caught the flutter of her breathing. On his left, Caldwell stiffened  and became a rock.\n\n\n Johnson had not seen Unger appear. One second the circle of light  had been empty, the next second the Venusian, smiling with all the  impassivity of a bland Buddha, was in the light. He weighed three  hundred pounds if he weighed an ounce, he was clad in a long robe  that would impede movement. He had appeared in the bright beam of the  spotlight as if by magic.\n\n\n Vee Vee's fingers dug deeper into Johnson's arm. \"How\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Shhh. Nobody knows.\"\n\n\n No human knew the answer to that trick. Unless perhaps Martin\u2014\n\n\n Unger bowed. A little ripple of something that was not quite sound  passed through the audience. Unger bowed again. He stretched himself  flat on the mat, adjusted the rest to support his head, and apparently  went to sleep. Johnson saw the Dreamer's eyes close, watched the chest  take on the even, regular rhythm of sleep.\n\n\n The music changed, a slow dreamy tempo crept into it. Vee Vee's fingers  dug at Johnson's arm as if they were trying to dig under his hide for  protection. She was shivering. He reached for her hand, patted it. She  drew closer to him.\n\n\n A few minutes earlier, she had been a very certain young woman, able  to take care of herself, and handle anyone around her. Now she was  suddenly uncertain, suddenly scared. In the Room of the Dreaming, she  had suddenly become a frightened child looking for protection.\n\n\n \"Haven't you ever seen this before?\" he whispered.\n\n\n \"N\u2014o.\" She shivered again. \"Oh, Johnny....\"\n\n\n Under the circle of light pouring down from the ceiling, the Dreamer  lay motionless. Johnson found himself with the tendency to hold his  breath. He was waiting, waiting, waiting\u2014for what? The whole situation  was senseless, silly, but under its apparent lack of coherence, he  sensed a pattern. Perhaps the path to the far-off stars passed this  way, through such scented and musical and impossible places as these  Rooms of the Dreamers. Certainly Martin thought so. And Johnson himself  was not prepared to disagree.\n\n\n Around him, he saw that the Venusians were already going ... going ...  going.... Some of them were already gone. This was an old experience  to them. They went rapidly. Humans went more slowly.\n\n\n The Venusian watchers had relaxed. They looked as if they were asleep,  perhaps in a hypnotic trance, lulled into this state by the music  and the perfume, and by something else. It was this something else  that sent Johnson's thoughts pounding. The Venusians were like opium  smokers. But he was not smoking opium. He was not in a hypnotic trance.  He was wide awake and very much alert. He was ... watching a space ship float in an endless void .\n\n\n As Unger had come into the spotlight, so the space ship had come into  his vision, out of nowhere, out of nothingness. The room, the Dreamer,  the sound of the music, the sweetness of the perfume, Vee Vee and  Caldwell were gone. They were no longer in his reality. They were not  in the range of his vision. It was as if they did not exist. Yet he  knew they did exist, the memory of them, and of other things, was out  on the periphery of his universe, perhaps of the universe.\n\n\n All he saw was the space ship.\n\n\n It was a wonderful thing, perhaps the most beautiful sight he had seen  in his life. At the sight of it, a deep glow sprang inside of him.\n\n\n Back when he had been a kid he had dreamed of flight to the far-off  stars. He had made models of space ships. In a way, they had shaped his  destiny, had made him what he was. They had brought him where he was  this night, to the Dream Room of a Venusian tavern.\n\n\n The vision of the space ship floating in the void entranced and  thrilled him. Something told him that this was real; that here and now  he was making contact with a vision that belonged to time.\n\n\n He started to his feet. Fingers gripped his arm.\n\n\n \"Please, darling. You startled me. Don't move.\" Vee Vee's voice. Who  was Vee Vee?\n\n\n The fingers dug into his arm. Pain came up in him. The space ship  vanished. He looked with startled eyes at Vee Vee, at the Dream Room,  at Unger, dreaming on the mat under the spot.\n\n\n \"You ... you startled me,\" Vee Vee whispered. She released the grip on  his arm.\n\n\n \"But, didn't you see it?\"\n\n\n \"See what?\"\n\n\n \"The space ship!\"\n\n\n \"No. No.\" She seemed startled and a little terrified and half asleep.  \"I ... I was watching something else. When you moved I broke contact  with my dream.\"\n\n\n \"Your dream?\"\n\n\n He asked a question but she did not answer it. \"Sit down, darling,  and look at your damned space ship.\" Her voice was a taut whisper of  sound in the darkened room. Johnson settled down. A glance to his left  told him that Caldwell was still sitting like a chunk of stone.... The  Venusians were quiet. The music had shifted. A slow languorous beat  of hidden drums filled the room. There was another sound present, a  high-speed whirring. It was, somehow, a familiar sound, but Johnson had  not heard it before in this place.\n\n\n He thought about the space ship he had seen.\n\n\n The vision would not come.\n\n\n He shook his head and tried again.\n\n\n Beside him, Vee Vee was silent, her face ecstatic, like the face of a  woman in love.\n\n\n He tried again for the space ship.\n\n\n It would not come.\n\n\n Anger came up instead.\n\n\n Somehow he had the impression that the whirring sound which kept  intruding into his consciousness was stopping the vision.\n\n\n So far as he could tell, he was the only one present who was not  dreaming, who was not in a state of trance.\n\n\n His gaze went to Unger, the Dreamer....\n\n\n Cold flowed over him.\n\n\n Unger was slowly rising from the mat.\n\n\n The bland face and the body in the robe were slowly floating upward! III\n\n\n An invisible force seemed to twitch at Johnson's skin, nipping it here  and there with a multitude of tiny pinches, like invisible fleas biting  him.\n\n\n \"This is it!\" a voice whispered in his mind. \"This is what you came to  Venus to see. This ... this....\" The first voice went into silence.  Another voice took its place.\n\n\n \"This is another damned vision!\" the second voice said. \"This ...  this is something that is not real, that is not possible! No Venusian  Dreamer, and no one else, can levitate, can defy the laws of gravity,  can float upward toward the ceiling. Your damned eyes are tricking you!\"\n\n\n \"We are not tricking you!\" the eyes hotly insisted. \"It is happening.  We are seeing it. We are reporting accurately to you. That Venusian  Buddha is levitating. We, your eyes, do not lie to you!\"\n\n\n \"You lied about the space ship!\" the second voice said.\n\n\n \"We did not lie about the space ship!\" the eyes insisted. \"When our  master saw that ship we were out of focus, we were not reporting. Some  other sense, some other organ, may have lied, but we did not.\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014\" Johnson whispered.\n\n\n \"I am your skin,\" another voice whispered. \"I am covered with sweat.\"\n\n\n \"We are your adrenals. We are pouring forth adrenalin.\"\n\n\n \"I am your pancreas. I am gearing you for action.\"\n\n\n \"I am your thyroid. I....\"\n\n\n A multitude of tiny voices seemed to whisper through him. It was as if  the parts of his body had suddenly found voices and were reporting to  him what they were doing. These were voices out of his training days  when he had learned the names of these functions and how to use them.\n\n\n \"Be quiet!\" he said roughly.\n\n\n The little voices seemed to blend into a single chorus. \"Action,  Master! Do something.\"\n\n\n \"Quiet!\" Johnson ordered.\n\n\n \"But hurry. We are excited.\"\n\n\n \"There is a time to be excited and a time to hurry. In this situation,  if action is taken before the time for it\u2014if that time ever comes\u2014we  can all die.\"\n\n\n \"Die?\" the chorus quavered.\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Johnson said. \"Now be quiet. When the time goes we will all go  together.\"\n\n\n The chorus went into muted silence. But just under the threshold the  little voices were a multitude of tiny fretful pressures.\n\n\n \"I hear a whirring sound,\" his ears reported.\n\n\n \"Please!\" Johnson said.\n\n\n In the front of the room Unger floated ten feet above the floor.\n\n\n \"Master, we are not lying!\" his eyes repeated.\n\n\n \"I sweat....\" his skin began.\n\n\n \"Watch Unger!\" Johnson said.\n\n\n The Dreamer floated. If wires suspended him, Johnson could not see  them. If any known force lifted him, Johnson could not detect that  force. All he could say for certain was that Unger floated.\n\n\n \"Yaaah!\" The silence of a room was broken by the enraged scream of a  Venusian being jarred out of his dream.\n\n\n \"Damn it!\" A human voice said.\n\n\n A wave as sharp as the tip of a sword swept through the room.\n\n\n Unger fell.\n\n\n He was ten feet high when he started to fall. With a bone-breaking,  body-jarring thud, the Dreamer fell. Hard.\n\n\n There was a split second of startled silence in the Dreaming Room. The  silence went. Voices came.\n\n\n \"Who did that?\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\"\n\n\n \"That human hidden there did it! He broke the Dreaming!\" Anger marked  the voices. Although the language was Venusian, Johnson got most of the  meaning. His hand dived under his coat for the gun holstered there. At  his left, Caldwell was muttering thickly. \"What\u2014what happened? I was  back in the lab on Earth\u2014\" Caldwell's voice held a plaintive note, as  if some pleasant dream had been interrupted.\n\n\n On Johnson's right, Vee Vee seemed to flow to life. Her arms came up  around his neck. He was instantly prepared for anything. Her lips came  hungrily against his lips, pressed very hard, then gently drew away.\n\n\n \"What\u2014\" he gasped.\n\n\n \"I had to do it now, darling,\" she answered. \"There may not be a later.\"\n\n\n Johnson had no time to ask her what she meant. Somewhere in the back  of the room a human screamed. He jerked around. Back there a knot of  Venusians were attacking a man.\n\n\n \"It's Martin!\" Caldwell shouted. \"He is here!\"\n\n\n In Johnson's hand as he came to his feet the zit gun throbbed. He fired  blindly at the mass of Venusians. Caldwell was firing too. The soft  throb of the guns was not audible above the uproar from the crowd.  Struck by the gas-driven corvel charges, Venusians were falling. But  there seemed to be an endless number of them.\n\n\n \"Vee Vee?\" Johnson suddenly realized that she had disappeared. She had  slid out of his sight.\n\n\n \"Vee Vee!\" Johnson's voice became a shout.\n\n\n \"To hell with the woman!\" Caldwell grunted. \"Martin's the important  one.\"\n\n\n Zit, zit, zit, Caldwell moved toward the rear, shooting as he went.  Johnson followed. ",

TROY A world-famed Earth scientist had disappeared on Venus.   When Johnson found him, he found too the secret to that   globe-shaking mystery\u2014the fabulous Room of The Dreaming. [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories November 1952.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] The city dripped with rain. Crossing the street toward the dive,  Johnson got rain in his eyes, his nose, and his ears. That was the way  with the rain here. It came at you from all directions. There had been  occasions when Johnson had thought the rain was falling straight up.  Otherwise, how had the insides of his pants gotten wet?\n\n\n On Venus, everything came at you from all directions, it seemed to  Johnson. Opening the door of the joint, it was noise instead of rain  that came at him, the wild frantic beat of a Venusian rhumba, the  notes pounding and jumping through the smoke and perfume clouded room.  Feeling states came at him, intangible, but to his trained senses,  perceptible emotional nuances of hate, love, fear, and rage. But mostly  love. Since this place had been designed to excite the senses of both  humans and Venusians, the love feelings were heavily tinged with  straight sex. He sniffed at them, feeling them somewhere inside of him,  aware of them but aware also that here was apprehension, and plain fear.\n\n\n Caldwell, sitting in a booth next to the door, glanced up as Johnson  entered but neither Caldwell's facial expression or his eyes revealed  that he had ever seen this human before. Nor did Johnson seem to  recognize Caldwell.\n\n\n \"Is the mighty human wanting liquor, a woman or dreams?\" His voice  was all soft syllables of liquid sound. The Venusian equivalent of a  headwaiter was bowing to him.\n\n\n \"I'll have a tarmur to start,\" Johnson said. \"How are the dreams  tonight?\"\n\n\n \"Ze vill be the most wonserful of all sonight. The great Unger hisself  will be here to do ze dreaming. There is no ozzer one who has quite  his touch at dreaming, mighty one.\" The headwaiter spread his hands  in a gesture indicating ecstasy. \"It is my great regret that I must do  ze work tonight instead of being wiz ze dreamers. Ah, ze great Unger  hisself!\" The headwaiter kissed the tips of his fingers.\n\n\n \"Um,\" Johnson said. \"The great Unger!\" His voice expressed surprise,  just the right amount of it. \"I'll have a tarmur to start but when does  the dreaming commence?\"\n\n\n \"In one zonar or maybe less. Shall I make ze reservations for ze mighty  one?\" As he was speaking, the headwaiter was deftly conducting Johnson  to the bar.\n\n\n \"Not just yet,\" Johnson said. \"See me a little later.\"\n\n\n \"But certainly.\" The headwaiter was gone into the throng. Johnson was  at the bar. Behind it, a Venusian was bowing to him. \"Tarmur,\" Johnson  said. The green drink was set before him. He held it up to the light,  admiring the slow rise of the tiny golden bubbles in it. To him,  watching the bubbles rise was perhaps more important than drinking  itself.\n\n\n \"Beautiful, aren't they?\" a soft voice said. He glanced to his right.  A girl had slid into the stool beside him. She wore a green dress cut  very low at the throat. Her skin had the pleasant tan recently on  Earth. Her hair was a shade of abundant brown and her eyes were blue,  the color of the skies of Earth. A necklace circled her throat and  below the necklace ... Johnson felt his pulse quicken, for two reasons.  Women such as this one had been quickening the pulse of men since the  days of Adam. The second reason concerned her presence here in this  place where no woman in her right mind ever came unescorted. Her eyes  smiled up at him unafraid. Didn't she know there were men present here  in this space port city who would snatch her bodily from the bar  stool and carry her away for sleeping purposes? And Venusians were  here who would cut her pretty throat for the sake of the necklace that  circled it?\n\n\n \"They are beautiful,\" he said, smiling.\n\n\n \"Thank you.\"\n\n\n \"I was referring to the bubbles.\"\n\n\n \"You were talking about my eyes,\" she answered, unperturbed.\n\n\n \"How did you know? I mean....\"\n\n\n \"I am very knowing,\" the girl said, smiling.\n\n\n \"Are you sufficiently knowing to be here?\"\n\n\n For an instant, as if doubt crossed her mind, the smile flickered. Then  it came again, stronger. \"Aren't you here?\"\n\n\n Johnson choked as bubbles from the tarmur seemed to go suddenly up his  nose. \"My dear child ...\" he sputtered.\n\n\n \"I am not a child,\" she answered with a firm sureness that left no  doubt in his mind that she knew what she was saying. \"And my name is  Vee Vee.\"\n\n\n \"Vee Vee? Um. That is....\"\n\n\n \"Don't you think it's a nice name?\"\n\n\n \"I certainly do. Probably the rest of it is even nicer.\"\n\n\n \"There is no more of it. Just Vee Vee. Like Topsy, I just grew.\" \"What the devil are you doing here on Venus and here in this place?\"\n\n\n \"Growing.\" The blue eyes were unafraid.\n\n\n Sombrely, Johnson regarded her. What was she doing here? Was she in  the employ of the Venusians? If she was being planted on him, then  his purpose here was suspected. He shrugged the thought aside. If his  purpose here was suspected, there would be no point in planting a woman  on him.\n\n\n There would only be the minor matter of slipping a knife into his back.\n\n\n In this city, as on all of Venus, humans died easily. No one questioned  the motives of the killer.\n\n\n \"You look as if you were considering some very grave matter,\" Vee Vee  said.\n\n\n \"Not any longer,\" he laughed.\n\n\n \"You have decided them?\"\n\n\n \"Yes.\"\n\n\n \"Every last one of them?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, there might be one or two matters undecided somewhere, say out on  the periphery of the galaxy. But we will solve them when we get to  them.\" He waved vaguely toward the roof and the sky of space hidden  behind the clouds that lay over the roof, glanced around as a man eased  himself into an empty stool on his left. The man was Caldwell.\n\n\n \"Zlock!\" Caldwell said, to the bartender. \"Make it snappy. Gotta have  zlock. Finest damn drink in the solar system.\" Caldwell's voice was  thick, his tongue heavy. Johnson's eyes went back to the girl but out  of the corner of them he watched Caldwell's hand lying on the bar. The  fingers were beating a quick nervous tattoo on the yellow wood.\n\n\n \"I haven't seen him,\" Caldwell's fingers beat out their tattoo. \"But I  think he is, or was, here.\"\n\n\n \"Um,\" Johnson said, his eyes on Vee Vee. \"How\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Because that girl was asking for him,\" Caldwell's fingers answered.  \"Watch that girl!\" Picking up the zlock, he lurched away from the bar.\n\n\n \"Your friend is not as drunk as he seems,\" Vee Vee said, watching  Caldwell.\n\n\n \"My friend? Do you mean that drunk? I never saw him\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Lying is one of the deadly sins.\" Her eyes twinkled at him. Under the  merriment that danced in them there was ice. Johnson felt cold.\n\n\n \"The reservations for ze dreaming, great one?\" The headwaiter was  bowing and scraping in front of him. \"The great one has decided, yes?\"\n\n\n \"The dreaming!\" Vee Vee looked suddenly alert. \"Of course. We must see  the dreaming. Everyone wants to see the dreaming. We will go, won't we  darling?\" She hooked her hand into Johnson's elbow.\n\n\n \"Certainly,\" Johnson said. The decision was made on the spur of the  moment. That there was danger in it, he did not doubt. But there might  be something else. And he might be there.\n\n\n \"Oh. But very good. Ze great Unger, you will love him!\" The headwaiter  clutched the gold coins that Johnson extended, bowed himself out of  sight.\n\n\n \"Say, I want to know more\u2014\" Johnson began. His words were drowned in  a blast of trumpets. The band that had been playing went into sudden  silence. Waves of perfume began to flow into the place. The perfumes  were blended, but one aroma was prominent among them, the sweet,  cloying, soul-stirring perfume of the Dreamer.\n\n\n In the suddenly hushed place little sounds began to appear as Venusians  and humans began to shift their feet and their bodies in anticipation  of what was to happen.\n\n\n The trumpets flared again.\n\n\n On one side of the place, a big door began to swing slowly open. From  beyond that slowly opening door came music, soft, muted strains that  sounded like lutes from heaven.\n\n\n Vee Vee, her hand on Johnson's elbow, rose. Johnson stood up with  her. He got the surprise of his life as her fingers clenched, digging  into his muscles. Pain shot through his arm, paralyzing it and almost  paralyzing him. He knew instantly that she was using the Karmer nerve  block paralysis on him. His left hand moved with lightning speed, the  tips of his fingers striking savagely against her shoulder.\n\n\n She gasped, her face whitened as pain shot through her in response to  the thrust of his finger tips. Her hand that had been digging into his  elbow lost its grip, dropped away and hung limp at her side. Grabbing  it, she began to massage it.\n\n\n \"You\u2014you\u2014\" Hot anger and shock were in her voice. \"You're the first  man I ever knew who could break the Karmer nerve paralysis.\"\n\n\n \"And you're the first woman who ever tried it on me.\"\n\n\n \"But\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Shall we go watch the dreaming?\" He took the arm that still hung limp  at her side and tucked it into his elbow.\n\n\n \"If you try to use the Karmer grip on me again I'll break your arm,\" he  said. His voice was low but there was a wealth of meaning in it.\n\n\n \"I won't do it again,\" the girl said stoutly. \"I never make the same  mistake twice.\"\n\n\n \"Good,\" Johnson said.\n\n\n \"The second time we break our victim's neck,\" Vee Vee said.\n\n\n \"What a sweet, charming child you\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I told you before, I'm not a child.\"\n\n\n \"Child vampire,\" Johnson said. \"Let me finish my sentences before you  interrupt.\"\n\n\n She was silent. A smile, struggling to appear on her face, seemed to  say she held no malice. Her fingers tightened on Johnson's arm. He  tensed, expecting the nerve block grip again. Instead with the tips of  her fingers she gently patted his arm.\n\n\n \"There, there, darling, relax,\" she said. \"I know a better way to get  you than by using the Karmer grip.\"\n\n\n \"What way?\"\n\n\n Her eyes sparkled. \"Eve's way,\" she answered.\n\n\n \"Um!\" Surprise sounded in his grunt. \"But apples don't grow on Venus.\"\n\n\n \"Eve's daughters don't use apples any more, darling. Come along.\"\n\n\n Moving toward the open door that led to the Room of the Dreaming,  Johnson saw that Caldwell had risen and was following them. Caldwell's  face was writhing in apprehensive agony and he was making warning  signs. Johnson ignored them. With Vee Vee's fingers lightly patting his  arm, they moved into the Room of the Dreaming. II\n\n\n It was a huge, semi-illumined room, with tier on tier of circling ramps  rising up from an open space at the bottom. There ought to have been  a stage there at the bottom, but there wasn't. Instead there was an  open space, a mat, and a head rest. Up at the top of the circling ramps  the room was in darkness, a fit hiding place for ghosts or Venusian  werewolves. Pillows and a thick rug covered the circling ramps.\n\n\n The soul-quickening Perfume of the Dreamer was stronger here. The  throbbing of the lutes was louder. It was Venusian music the lutes were  playing. Human ears found it inharmonious at first, but as they became  accustomed to it, they began to detect rhythms and melodies that human  minds had not known existed. The room was pleasantly cool but it had  the feel of dampness. A world that was rarely without pelting rain  would have the feel of dampness in its dreaming rooms.\n\n\n The music playing strange harmonies in his ears, the perfume sending  tingling feelings through his nose, Johnson entered the Room of the  Dreamer. He suspected that other forces, unknown to him, were catching  hold of his senses. He had been in dreaming rooms many times before but  he had not grown accustomed to them. He wondered if any human ever  did. A touch of chill always came over him as he crossed the threshold.  In entering these places, it was as if some unknown nerve center  inside the human organism was touched by something, some force, some  radiation, some subtlety, that quite escaped radiation. He felt the  coldness now.\n\n\n Vee Vee's fingers left off patting his arm.\n\n\n \"Do you feel it, darling?\"\n\n\n \"Yes.\"\n\n\n \"What is it?\"\n\n\n \"How would I know?\"\n\n\n \"Please!\" Her voice grew sharp. \"I think Johnny Johnson ought to know.\"\n\n\n \"Johnny! How do you know my name?\"\n\n\n \"Shouldn't I recognize one of Earth's foremost scientists, even if he  is incognito on Venus?\" Her voice had a teasing quality in it.\n\n\n \"But\u2014\"\n\n\n \"And who besides Johnny Johnson would recognize the Karmer nerve grip  and be able to break it instantly?\"\n\n\n \"Hell\u2014\"\n\n\n \"John Michael Johnson, known as Johnny to his friends, Earth's foremost  expert in the field of electro-magnetic radiations within the human  body!\" Her words were needles of icy fact, each one jabbing deeper and  deeper into him.\n\n\n \"And how would I make certain you were Johnny Johnson, except by seeing  if you could break the Karmer nerve grip? If you could break it, then  there was no doubt who you were!\" Her words went on and on.\n\n\n \"Who are you?\" His words were blasts of sound.\n\n\n \"Please, darling, you are making a scene. I am sure this is the last  thing you really want to do.\"\n\n\n He looked quickly around them. The Venusians and humans moving into  this room seemed to be paying no attention to him. His gaze came back  to her.\n\n\n Again she patted his arm. \"Relax, darling. Your secrets are safe with  me.\"\n\n\n A gray color came up inside his soul. \"But\u2014but\u2014\" His voice was  suddenly weak.\n\n\n The fingers on his arm were very gentle. \"No harm will come to you. Am  I not with you?\"\n\n\n \"That's what I'm afraid of!\" he snapped at her. If he had had a  choice, he might have drawn back. But with circumstances as they  were\u2014his life, Caldwell's life, possibly Vee Vee's life hung in the  balance. Didn't she know that this was true? And as for Martin\u2014But  Caldwell had said that she had been asking about Martin. What  connection did she have with that frantic human genius he sought here?\n\n\n Johnson felt his skin crawl. He moved toward a nest of cushions on  a ramp, found a Venusian was beating him to them, deftly changed to  another nest, found it. Vee Vee flowed to the floor on his right, moved  cushions to make him more comfortable. She moved in an easy sort of way  that was all flowing movement. He sat down. Someone bumped him on the  left.\n\n\n \"Sorry, bud. Didn't mean to bump into you.\" Caldwell's voice was still  thick and heavy. He sprawled to the floor on Johnson's left. Under  the man's coat, Johnson caught a glimpse of a slight bulge, the zit  gun hidden there. His left arm pressed against his own coat, feeling  his own zit gun. Operating under gas pressure, throwing a charge of  gas-driven corvel, the zit guns were not only almost noiseless in  operation but they knocked out a human or a Venusian in a matter of  seconds.\n\n\n True, the person they knocked unconscious would be all right the next  day. For this reason, many people did not regard the zit guns as  effective weapons, but Johnson had a fondness for them. The feel of the  little weapon inside his coat sent a surge of comfort through him.\n\n\n The music picked up a beat, perfume seemed to flow even more freely  through the air, the lights dimmed almost to darkness, a single bright  spotlight appeared in the ceiling, casting a circle of brilliant  illumination on the mat and the headrest at the bottom of the room. The  curtain rose. Unger stood in the middle of the spot of light.\n\n\n Johnson felt his chest muscles contract, then relax. Vee Vee's fingers  sought his arm, not to harm him but running to him for protection. He  caught the flutter of her breathing. On his left, Caldwell stiffened  and became a rock.\n\n\n Johnson had not seen Unger appear. One second the circle of light  had been empty, the next second the Venusian, smiling with all the  impassivity of a bland Buddha, was in the light. He weighed three  hundred pounds if he weighed an ounce, he was clad in a long robe  that would impede movement. He had appeared in the bright beam of the  spotlight as if by magic.\n\n\n Vee Vee's fingers dug deeper into Johnson's arm. \"How\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Shhh. Nobody knows.\"\n\n\n No human knew the answer to that trick. Unless perhaps Martin\u2014\n\n\n Unger bowed. A little ripple of something that was not quite sound  passed through the audience. Unger bowed again. He stretched himself  flat on the mat, adjusted the rest to support his head, and apparently  went to sleep. Johnson saw the Dreamer's eyes close, watched the chest  take on the even, regular rhythm of sleep.\n\n\n The music changed, a slow dreamy tempo crept into it. Vee Vee's fingers  dug at Johnson's arm as if they were trying to dig under his hide for  protection. She was shivering. He reached for her hand, patted it. She  drew closer to him.\n\n\n A few minutes earlier, she had been a very certain young woman, able  to take care of herself, and handle anyone around her. Now she was  suddenly uncertain, suddenly scared. In the Room of the Dreaming, she  had suddenly become a frightened child looking for protection.\n\n\n \"Haven't you ever seen this before?\" he whispered.\n\n\n \"N\u2014o.\" She shivered again. \"Oh, Johnny....\"\n\n\n Under the circle of light pouring down from the ceiling, the Dreamer  lay motionless. Johnson found himself with the tendency to hold his  breath. He was waiting, waiting, waiting\u2014for what? The whole situation  was senseless, silly, but under its apparent lack of coherence, he  sensed a pattern. Perhaps the path to the far-off stars passed this  way, through such scented and musical and impossible places as these  Rooms of the Dreamers. Certainly Martin thought so. And Johnson himself  was not prepared to disagree.\n\n\n Around him, he saw that the Venusians were already going ... going ...  going.... Some of them were already gone. This was an old experience  to them. They went rapidly. Humans went more slowly.\n\n\n The Venusian watchers had relaxed. They looked as if they were asleep,  perhaps in a hypnotic trance, lulled into this state by the music  and the perfume, and by something else. It was this something else  that sent Johnson's thoughts pounding. The Venusians were like opium  smokers. But he was not smoking opium. He was not in a hypnotic trance.  He was wide awake and very much alert. He was ... watching a space ship float in an endless void .\n\n\n As Unger had come into the spotlight, so the space ship had come into  his vision, out of nowhere, out of nothingness. The room, the Dreamer,  the sound of the music, the sweetness of the perfume, Vee Vee and  Caldwell were gone. They were no longer in his reality. They were not  in the range of his vision. It was as if they did not exist. Yet he  knew they did exist, the memory of them, and of other things, was out  on the periphery of his universe, perhaps of the universe.\n\n\n All he saw was the space ship.\n\n\n It was a wonderful thing, perhaps the most beautiful sight he had seen  in his life. At the sight of it, a deep glow sprang inside of him.\n\n\n Back when he had been a kid he had dreamed of flight to the far-off  stars. He had made models of space ships. In a way, they had shaped his  destiny, had made him what he was. They had brought him where he was  this night, to the Dream Room of a Venusian tavern.\n\n\n The vision of the space ship floating in the void entranced and  thrilled him. Something told him that this was real; that here and now  he was making contact with a vision that belonged to time.\n\n\n He started to his feet. Fingers gripped his arm.\n\n\n \"Please, darling. You startled me. Don't move.\" Vee Vee's voice. Who  was Vee Vee?\n\n\n The fingers dug into his arm. Pain came up in him. The space ship  vanished. He looked with startled eyes at Vee Vee, at the Dream Room,  at Unger, dreaming on the mat under the spot.\n\n\n \"You ... you startled me,\" Vee Vee whispered. She released the grip on  his arm.\n\n\n \"But, didn't you see it?\"\n\n\n \"See what?\"\n\n\n \"The space ship!\"\n\n\n \"No. No.\" She seemed startled and a little terrified and half asleep.  \"I ... I was watching something else. When you moved I broke contact  with my dream.\"\n\n\n \"Your dream?\"\n\n\n He asked a question but she did not answer it. \"Sit down, darling,  and look at your damned space ship.\" Her voice was a taut whisper of  sound in the darkened room. Johnson settled down. A glance to his left  told him that Caldwell was still sitting like a chunk of stone.... The  Venusians were quiet. The music had shifted. A slow languorous beat  of hidden drums filled the room. There was another sound present, a  high-speed whirring. It was, somehow, a familiar sound, but Johnson had  not heard it before in this place.\n\n\n He thought about the space ship he had seen.\n\n\n The vision would not come.\n\n\n He shook his head and tried again.\n\n\n Beside him, Vee Vee was silent, her face ecstatic, like the face of a  woman in love.\n\n\n He tried again for the space ship.\n\n\n It would not come.\n\n\n Anger came up instead.\n\n\n Somehow he had the impression that the whirring sound which kept  intruding into his consciousness was stopping the vision.\n\n\n So far as he could tell, he was the only one present who was not  dreaming, who was not in a state of trance.\n\n\n His gaze went to Unger, the Dreamer....\n\n\n Cold flowed over him.\n\n\n Unger was slowly rising from the mat.\n\n\n The bland face and the body in the robe were slowly floating upward! III\n\n\n An invisible force seemed to twitch at Johnson's skin, nipping it here  and there with a multitude of tiny pinches, like invisible fleas biting  him.\n\n\n \"This is it!\" a voice whispered in his mind. \"This is what you came to  Venus to see. This ... this....\" The first voice went into silence.  Another voice took its place.\n\n\n \"This is another damned vision!\" the second voice said. \"This ...  this is something that is not real, that is not possible! No Venusian  Dreamer, and no one else, can levitate, can defy the laws of gravity,  can float upward toward the ceiling. Your damned eyes are tricking you!\"\n\n\n \"We are not tricking you!\" the eyes hotly insisted. \"It is happening.  We are seeing it. We are reporting accurately to you. That Venusian  Buddha is levitating. We, your eyes, do not lie to you!\"\n\n\n \"You lied about the space ship!\" the second voice said.\n\n\n \"We did not lie about the space ship!\" the eyes insisted. \"When our  master saw that ship we were out of focus, we were not reporting. Some  other sense, some other organ, may have lied, but we did not.\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014\" Johnson whispered.\n\n\n \"I am your skin,\" another voice whispered. \"I am covered with sweat.\"\n\n\n \"We are your adrenals. We are pouring forth adrenalin.\"\n\n\n \"I am your pancreas. I am gearing you for action.\"\n\n\n \"I am your thyroid. I....\"\n\n\n A multitude of tiny voices seemed to whisper through him. It was as if  the parts of his body had suddenly found voices and were reporting to  him what they were doing. These were voices out of his training days  when he had learned the names of these functions and how to use them.\n\n\n \"Be quiet!\" he said roughly.\n\n\n The little voices seemed to blend into a single chorus. \"Action,  Master! Do something.\"\n\n\n \"Quiet!\" Johnson ordered.\n\n\n \"But hurry. We are excited.\"\n\n\n \"There is a time to be excited and a time to hurry. In this situation,  if action is taken before the time for it\u2014if that time ever comes\u2014we  can all die.\"\n\n\n \"Die?\" the chorus quavered.\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Johnson said. \"Now be quiet. When the time goes we will all go  together.\"\n\n\n The chorus went into muted silence. But just under the threshold the  little voices were a multitude of tiny fretful pressures.\n\n\n \"I hear a whirring sound,\" his ears reported.\n\n\n \"Please!\" Johnson said.\n\n\n In the front of the room Unger floated ten feet above the floor.\n\n\n \"Master, we are not lying!\" his eyes repeated.\n\n\n \"I sweat....\" his skin began.\n\n\n \"Watch Unger!\" Johnson said.\n\n\n The Dreamer floated. If wires suspended him, Johnson could not see  them. If any known force lifted him, Johnson could not detect that  force. All he could say for certain was that Unger floated.\n\n\n \"Yaaah!\" The silence of a room was broken by the enraged scream of a  Venusian being jarred out of his dream.\n\n\n \"Damn it!\" A human voice said.\n\n\n A wave as sharp as the tip of a sword swept through the room.\n\n\n Unger fell.\n\n\n He was ten feet high when he started to fall. With a bone-breaking,  body-jarring thud, the Dreamer fell. Hard.\n\n\n There was a split second of startled silence in the Dreaming Room. The  silence went. Voices came.\n\n\n \"Who did that?\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\"\n\n\n \"That human hidden there did it! He broke the Dreaming!\" Anger marked  the voices. Although the language was Venusian, Johnson got most of the  meaning. His hand dived under his coat for the gun holstered there. At  his left, Caldwell was muttering thickly. \"What\u2014what happened? I was  back in the lab on Earth\u2014\" Caldwell's voice held a plaintive note, as  if some pleasant dream had been interrupted.\n\n\n On Johnson's right, Vee Vee seemed to flow to life. Her arms came up  around his neck. He was instantly prepared for anything. Her lips came  hungrily against his lips, pressed very hard, then gently drew away.\n\n\n \"What\u2014\" he gasped.\n\n\n \"I had to do it now, darling,\" she answered. \"There may not be a later.\"\n\n\n Johnson had no time to ask her what she meant. Somewhere in the back  of the room a human screamed. He jerked around. Back there a knot of  Venusians were attacking a man.\n\n\n \"It's Martin!\" Caldwell shouted. \"He is here!\"\n\n\n In Johnson's hand as he came to his feet the zit gun throbbed. He fired  blindly at the mass of Venusians. Caldwell was firing too. The soft  throb of the guns was not audible above the uproar from the crowd.  Struck by the gas-driven corvel charges, Venusians were falling. But  there seemed to be an endless number of them.\n\n\n \"Vee Vee?\" Johnson suddenly realized that she had disappeared. She had  slid out of his sight.\n\n\n \"Vee Vee!\" Johnson's voice became a shout.\n\n\n \"To hell with the woman!\" Caldwell grunted. \"Martin's the important  one.\"\n\n\n Zit, zit, zit, Caldwell moved toward the rear, shooting as he went.  Johnson followed. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow many different bars do Vee Vee and Johnson visit in the story?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Two\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"One\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"One\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"One\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

TROY A world-famed Earth scientist had disappeared on Venus.   When Johnson found him, he found too the secret to that   globe-shaking mystery\u2014the fabulous Room of The Dreaming. [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories November 1952.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] The city dripped with rain. Crossing the street toward the dive,  Johnson got rain in his eyes, his nose, and his ears. That was the way  with the rain here. It came at you from all directions. There had been  occasions when Johnson had thought the rain was falling straight up.  Otherwise, how had the insides of his pants gotten wet?\n\n\n On Venus, everything came at you from all directions, it seemed to  Johnson. Opening the door of the joint, it was noise instead of rain  that came at him, the wild frantic beat of a Venusian rhumba, the  notes pounding and jumping through the smoke and perfume clouded room.  Feeling states came at him, intangible, but to his trained senses,  perceptible emotional nuances of hate, love, fear, and rage. But mostly  love. Since this place had been designed to excite the senses of both  humans and Venusians, the love feelings were heavily tinged with  straight sex. He sniffed at them, feeling them somewhere inside of him,  aware of them but aware also that here was apprehension, and plain fear.\n\n\n Caldwell, sitting in a booth next to the door, glanced up as Johnson  entered but neither Caldwell's facial expression or his eyes revealed  that he had ever seen this human before. Nor did Johnson seem to  recognize Caldwell.\n\n\n \"Is the mighty human wanting liquor, a woman or dreams?\" His voice  was all soft syllables of liquid sound. The Venusian equivalent of a  headwaiter was bowing to him.\n\n\n \"I'll have a tarmur to start,\" Johnson said. \"How are the dreams  tonight?\"\n\n\n \"Ze vill be the most wonserful of all sonight. The great Unger hisself  will be here to do ze dreaming. There is no ozzer one who has quite  his touch at dreaming, mighty one.\" The headwaiter spread his hands  in a gesture indicating ecstasy. \"It is my great regret that I must do  ze work tonight instead of being wiz ze dreamers. Ah, ze great Unger  hisself!\" The headwaiter kissed the tips of his fingers.\n\n\n \"Um,\" Johnson said. \"The great Unger!\" His voice expressed surprise,  just the right amount of it. \"I'll have a tarmur to start but when does  the dreaming commence?\"\n\n\n \"In one zonar or maybe less. Shall I make ze reservations for ze mighty  one?\" As he was speaking, the headwaiter was deftly conducting Johnson  to the bar.\n\n\n \"Not just yet,\" Johnson said. \"See me a little later.\"\n\n\n \"But certainly.\" The headwaiter was gone into the throng. Johnson was  at the bar. Behind it, a Venusian was bowing to him. \"Tarmur,\" Johnson  said. The green drink was set before him. He held it up to the light,  admiring the slow rise of the tiny golden bubbles in it. To him,  watching the bubbles rise was perhaps more important than drinking  itself.\n\n\n \"Beautiful, aren't they?\" a soft voice said. He glanced to his right.  A girl had slid into the stool beside him. She wore a green dress cut  very low at the throat. Her skin had the pleasant tan recently on  Earth. Her hair was a shade of abundant brown and her eyes were blue,  the color of the skies of Earth. A necklace circled her throat and  below the necklace ... Johnson felt his pulse quicken, for two reasons.  Women such as this one had been quickening the pulse of men since the  days of Adam. The second reason concerned her presence here in this  place where no woman in her right mind ever came unescorted. Her eyes  smiled up at him unafraid. Didn't she know there were men present here  in this space port city who would snatch her bodily from the bar  stool and carry her away for sleeping purposes? And Venusians were  here who would cut her pretty throat for the sake of the necklace that  circled it?\n\n\n \"They are beautiful,\" he said, smiling.\n\n\n \"Thank you.\"\n\n\n \"I was referring to the bubbles.\"\n\n\n \"You were talking about my eyes,\" she answered, unperturbed.\n\n\n \"How did you know? I mean....\"\n\n\n \"I am very knowing,\" the girl said, smiling.\n\n\n \"Are you sufficiently knowing to be here?\"\n\n\n For an instant, as if doubt crossed her mind, the smile flickered. Then  it came again, stronger. \"Aren't you here?\"\n\n\n Johnson choked as bubbles from the tarmur seemed to go suddenly up his  nose. \"My dear child ...\" he sputtered.\n\n\n \"I am not a child,\" she answered with a firm sureness that left no  doubt in his mind that she knew what she was saying. \"And my name is  Vee Vee.\"\n\n\n \"Vee Vee? Um. That is....\"\n\n\n \"Don't you think it's a nice name?\"\n\n\n \"I certainly do. Probably the rest of it is even nicer.\"\n\n\n \"There is no more of it. Just Vee Vee. Like Topsy, I just grew.\" \"What the devil are you doing here on Venus and here in this place?\"\n\n\n \"Growing.\" The blue eyes were unafraid.\n\n\n Sombrely, Johnson regarded her. What was she doing here? Was she in  the employ of the Venusians? If she was being planted on him, then  his purpose here was suspected. He shrugged the thought aside. If his  purpose here was suspected, there would be no point in planting a woman  on him.\n\n\n There would only be the minor matter of slipping a knife into his back.\n\n\n In this city, as on all of Venus, humans died easily. No one questioned  the motives of the killer.\n\n\n \"You look as if you were considering some very grave matter,\" Vee Vee  said.\n\n\n \"Not any longer,\" he laughed.\n\n\n \"You have decided them?\"\n\n\n \"Yes.\"\n\n\n \"Every last one of them?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, there might be one or two matters undecided somewhere, say out on  the periphery of the galaxy. But we will solve them when we get to  them.\" He waved vaguely toward the roof and the sky of space hidden  behind the clouds that lay over the roof, glanced around as a man eased  himself into an empty stool on his left. The man was Caldwell.\n\n\n \"Zlock!\" Caldwell said, to the bartender. \"Make it snappy. Gotta have  zlock. Finest damn drink in the solar system.\" Caldwell's voice was  thick, his tongue heavy. Johnson's eyes went back to the girl but out  of the corner of them he watched Caldwell's hand lying on the bar. The  fingers were beating a quick nervous tattoo on the yellow wood.\n\n\n \"I haven't seen him,\" Caldwell's fingers beat out their tattoo. \"But I  think he is, or was, here.\"\n\n\n \"Um,\" Johnson said, his eyes on Vee Vee. \"How\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Because that girl was asking for him,\" Caldwell's fingers answered.  \"Watch that girl!\" Picking up the zlock, he lurched away from the bar.\n\n\n \"Your friend is not as drunk as he seems,\" Vee Vee said, watching  Caldwell.\n\n\n \"My friend? Do you mean that drunk? I never saw him\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Lying is one of the deadly sins.\" Her eyes twinkled at him. Under the  merriment that danced in them there was ice. Johnson felt cold.\n\n\n \"The reservations for ze dreaming, great one?\" The headwaiter was  bowing and scraping in front of him. \"The great one has decided, yes?\"\n\n\n \"The dreaming!\" Vee Vee looked suddenly alert. \"Of course. We must see  the dreaming. Everyone wants to see the dreaming. We will go, won't we  darling?\" She hooked her hand into Johnson's elbow.\n\n\n \"Certainly,\" Johnson said. The decision was made on the spur of the  moment. That there was danger in it, he did not doubt. But there might  be something else. And he might be there.\n\n\n \"Oh. But very good. Ze great Unger, you will love him!\" The headwaiter  clutched the gold coins that Johnson extended, bowed himself out of  sight.\n\n\n \"Say, I want to know more\u2014\" Johnson began. His words were drowned in  a blast of trumpets. The band that had been playing went into sudden  silence. Waves of perfume began to flow into the place. The perfumes  were blended, but one aroma was prominent among them, the sweet,  cloying, soul-stirring perfume of the Dreamer.\n\n\n In the suddenly hushed place little sounds began to appear as Venusians  and humans began to shift their feet and their bodies in anticipation  of what was to happen.\n\n\n The trumpets flared again.\n\n\n On one side of the place, a big door began to swing slowly open. From  beyond that slowly opening door came music, soft, muted strains that  sounded like lutes from heaven.\n\n\n Vee Vee, her hand on Johnson's elbow, rose. Johnson stood up with  her. He got the surprise of his life as her fingers clenched, digging  into his muscles. Pain shot through his arm, paralyzing it and almost  paralyzing him. He knew instantly that she was using the Karmer nerve  block paralysis on him. His left hand moved with lightning speed, the  tips of his fingers striking savagely against her shoulder.\n\n\n She gasped, her face whitened as pain shot through her in response to  the thrust of his finger tips. Her hand that had been digging into his  elbow lost its grip, dropped away and hung limp at her side. Grabbing  it, she began to massage it.\n\n\n \"You\u2014you\u2014\" Hot anger and shock were in her voice. \"You're the first  man I ever knew who could break the Karmer nerve paralysis.\"\n\n\n \"And you're the first woman who ever tried it on me.\"\n\n\n \"But\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Shall we go watch the dreaming?\" He took the arm that still hung limp  at her side and tucked it into his elbow.\n\n\n \"If you try to use the Karmer grip on me again I'll break your arm,\" he  said. His voice was low but there was a wealth of meaning in it.\n\n\n \"I won't do it again,\" the girl said stoutly. \"I never make the same  mistake twice.\"\n\n\n \"Good,\" Johnson said.\n\n\n \"The second time we break our victim's neck,\" Vee Vee said.\n\n\n \"What a sweet, charming child you\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I told you before, I'm not a child.\"\n\n\n \"Child vampire,\" Johnson said. \"Let me finish my sentences before you  interrupt.\"\n\n\n She was silent. A smile, struggling to appear on her face, seemed to  say she held no malice. Her fingers tightened on Johnson's arm. He  tensed, expecting the nerve block grip again. Instead with the tips of  her fingers she gently patted his arm.\n\n\n \"There, there, darling, relax,\" she said. \"I know a better way to get  you than by using the Karmer grip.\"\n\n\n \"What way?\"\n\n\n Her eyes sparkled. \"Eve's way,\" she answered.\n\n\n \"Um!\" Surprise sounded in his grunt. \"But apples don't grow on Venus.\"\n\n\n \"Eve's daughters don't use apples any more, darling. Come along.\"\n\n\n Moving toward the open door that led to the Room of the Dreaming,  Johnson saw that Caldwell had risen and was following them. Caldwell's  face was writhing in apprehensive agony and he was making warning  signs. Johnson ignored them. With Vee Vee's fingers lightly patting his  arm, they moved into the Room of the Dreaming. II\n\n\n It was a huge, semi-illumined room, with tier on tier of circling ramps  rising up from an open space at the bottom. There ought to have been  a stage there at the bottom, but there wasn't. Instead there was an  open space, a mat, and a head rest. Up at the top of the circling ramps  the room was in darkness, a fit hiding place for ghosts or Venusian  werewolves. Pillows and a thick rug covered the circling ramps.\n\n\n The soul-quickening Perfume of the Dreamer was stronger here. The  throbbing of the lutes was louder. It was Venusian music the lutes were  playing. Human ears found it inharmonious at first, but as they became  accustomed to it, they began to detect rhythms and melodies that human  minds had not known existed. The room was pleasantly cool but it had  the feel of dampness. A world that was rarely without pelting rain  would have the feel of dampness in its dreaming rooms.\n\n\n The music playing strange harmonies in his ears, the perfume sending  tingling feelings through his nose, Johnson entered the Room of the  Dreamer. He suspected that other forces, unknown to him, were catching  hold of his senses. He had been in dreaming rooms many times before but  he had not grown accustomed to them. He wondered if any human ever  did. A touch of chill always came over him as he crossed the threshold.  In entering these places, it was as if some unknown nerve center  inside the human organism was touched by something, some force, some  radiation, some subtlety, that quite escaped radiation. He felt the  coldness now.\n\n\n Vee Vee's fingers left off patting his arm.\n\n\n \"Do you feel it, darling?\"\n\n\n \"Yes.\"\n\n\n \"What is it?\"\n\n\n \"How would I know?\"\n\n\n \"Please!\" Her voice grew sharp. \"I think Johnny Johnson ought to know.\"\n\n\n \"Johnny! How do you know my name?\"\n\n\n \"Shouldn't I recognize one of Earth's foremost scientists, even if he  is incognito on Venus?\" Her voice had a teasing quality in it.\n\n\n \"But\u2014\"\n\n\n \"And who besides Johnny Johnson would recognize the Karmer nerve grip  and be able to break it instantly?\"\n\n\n \"Hell\u2014\"\n\n\n \"John Michael Johnson, known as Johnny to his friends, Earth's foremost  expert in the field of electro-magnetic radiations within the human  body!\" Her words were needles of icy fact, each one jabbing deeper and  deeper into him.\n\n\n \"And how would I make certain you were Johnny Johnson, except by seeing  if you could break the Karmer nerve grip? If you could break it, then  there was no doubt who you were!\" Her words went on and on.\n\n\n \"Who are you?\" His words were blasts of sound.\n\n\n \"Please, darling, you are making a scene. I am sure this is the last  thing you really want to do.\"\n\n\n He looked quickly around them. The Venusians and humans moving into  this room seemed to be paying no attention to him. His gaze came back  to her.\n\n\n Again she patted his arm. \"Relax, darling. Your secrets are safe with  me.\"\n\n\n A gray color came up inside his soul. \"But\u2014but\u2014\" His voice was  suddenly weak.\n\n\n The fingers on his arm were very gentle. \"No harm will come to you. Am  I not with you?\"\n\n\n \"That's what I'm afraid of!\" he snapped at her. If he had had a  choice, he might have drawn back. But with circumstances as they  were\u2014his life, Caldwell's life, possibly Vee Vee's life hung in the  balance. Didn't she know that this was true? And as for Martin\u2014But  Caldwell had said that she had been asking about Martin. What  connection did she have with that frantic human genius he sought here?\n\n\n Johnson felt his skin crawl. He moved toward a nest of cushions on  a ramp, found a Venusian was beating him to them, deftly changed to  another nest, found it. Vee Vee flowed to the floor on his right, moved  cushions to make him more comfortable. She moved in an easy sort of way  that was all flowing movement. He sat down. Someone bumped him on the  left.\n\n\n \"Sorry, bud. Didn't mean to bump into you.\" Caldwell's voice was still  thick and heavy. He sprawled to the floor on Johnson's left. Under  the man's coat, Johnson caught a glimpse of a slight bulge, the zit  gun hidden there. His left arm pressed against his own coat, feeling  his own zit gun. Operating under gas pressure, throwing a charge of  gas-driven corvel, the zit guns were not only almost noiseless in  operation but they knocked out a human or a Venusian in a matter of  seconds.\n\n\n True, the person they knocked unconscious would be all right the next  day. For this reason, many people did not regard the zit guns as  effective weapons, but Johnson had a fondness for them. The feel of the  little weapon inside his coat sent a surge of comfort through him.\n\n\n The music picked up a beat, perfume seemed to flow even more freely  through the air, the lights dimmed almost to darkness, a single bright  spotlight appeared in the ceiling, casting a circle of brilliant  illumination on the mat and the headrest at the bottom of the room. The  curtain rose. Unger stood in the middle of the spot of light.\n\n\n Johnson felt his chest muscles contract, then relax. Vee Vee's fingers  sought his arm, not to harm him but running to him for protection. He  caught the flutter of her breathing. On his left, Caldwell stiffened  and became a rock.\n\n\n Johnson had not seen Unger appear. One second the circle of light  had been empty, the next second the Venusian, smiling with all the  impassivity of a bland Buddha, was in the light. He weighed three  hundred pounds if he weighed an ounce, he was clad in a long robe  that would impede movement. He had appeared in the bright beam of the  spotlight as if by magic.\n\n\n Vee Vee's fingers dug deeper into Johnson's arm. \"How\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Shhh. Nobody knows.\"\n\n\n No human knew the answer to that trick. Unless perhaps Martin\u2014\n\n\n Unger bowed. A little ripple of something that was not quite sound  passed through the audience. Unger bowed again. He stretched himself  flat on the mat, adjusted the rest to support his head, and apparently  went to sleep. Johnson saw the Dreamer's eyes close, watched the chest  take on the even, regular rhythm of sleep.\n\n\n The music changed, a slow dreamy tempo crept into it. Vee Vee's fingers  dug at Johnson's arm as if they were trying to dig under his hide for  protection. She was shivering. He reached for her hand, patted it. She  drew closer to him.\n\n\n A few minutes earlier, she had been a very certain young woman, able  to take care of herself, and handle anyone around her. Now she was  suddenly uncertain, suddenly scared. In the Room of the Dreaming, she  had suddenly become a frightened child looking for protection.\n\n\n \"Haven't you ever seen this before?\" he whispered.\n\n\n \"N\u2014o.\" She shivered again. \"Oh, Johnny....\"\n\n\n Under the circle of light pouring down from the ceiling, the Dreamer  lay motionless. Johnson found himself with the tendency to hold his  breath. He was waiting, waiting, waiting\u2014for what? The whole situation  was senseless, silly, but under its apparent lack of coherence, he  sensed a pattern. Perhaps the path to the far-off stars passed this  way, through such scented and musical and impossible places as these  Rooms of the Dreamers. Certainly Martin thought so. And Johnson himself  was not prepared to disagree.\n\n\n Around him, he saw that the Venusians were already going ... going ...  going.... Some of them were already gone. This was an old experience  to them. They went rapidly. Humans went more slowly.\n\n\n The Venusian watchers had relaxed. They looked as if they were asleep,  perhaps in a hypnotic trance, lulled into this state by the music  and the perfume, and by something else. It was this something else  that sent Johnson's thoughts pounding. The Venusians were like opium  smokers. But he was not smoking opium. He was not in a hypnotic trance.  He was wide awake and very much alert. He was ... watching a space ship float in an endless void .\n\n\n As Unger had come into the spotlight, so the space ship had come into  his vision, out of nowhere, out of nothingness. The room, the Dreamer,  the sound of the music, the sweetness of the perfume, Vee Vee and  Caldwell were gone. They were no longer in his reality. They were not  in the range of his vision. It was as if they did not exist. Yet he  knew they did exist, the memory of them, and of other things, was out  on the periphery of his universe, perhaps of the universe.\n\n\n All he saw was the space ship.\n\n\n It was a wonderful thing, perhaps the most beautiful sight he had seen  in his life. At the sight of it, a deep glow sprang inside of him.\n\n\n Back when he had been a kid he had dreamed of flight to the far-off  stars. He had made models of space ships. In a way, they had shaped his  destiny, had made him what he was. They had brought him where he was  this night, to the Dream Room of a Venusian tavern.\n\n\n The vision of the space ship floating in the void entranced and  thrilled him. Something told him that this was real; that here and now  he was making contact with a vision that belonged to time.\n\n\n He started to his feet. Fingers gripped his arm.\n\n\n \"Please, darling. You startled me. Don't move.\" Vee Vee's voice. Who  was Vee Vee?\n\n\n The fingers dug into his arm. Pain came up in him. The space ship  vanished. He looked with startled eyes at Vee Vee, at the Dream Room,  at Unger, dreaming on the mat under the spot.\n\n\n \"You ... you startled me,\" Vee Vee whispered. She released the grip on  his arm.\n\n\n \"But, didn't you see it?\"\n\n\n \"See what?\"\n\n\n \"The space ship!\"\n\n\n \"No. No.\" She seemed startled and a little terrified and half asleep.  \"I ... I was watching something else. When you moved I broke contact  with my dream.\"\n\n\n \"Your dream?\"\n\n\n He asked a question but she did not answer it. \"Sit down, darling,  and look at your damned space ship.\" Her voice was a taut whisper of  sound in the darkened room. Johnson settled down. A glance to his left  told him that Caldwell was still sitting like a chunk of stone.... The  Venusians were quiet. The music had shifted. A slow languorous beat  of hidden drums filled the room. There was another sound present, a  high-speed whirring. It was, somehow, a familiar sound, but Johnson had  not heard it before in this place.\n\n\n He thought about the space ship he had seen.\n\n\n The vision would not come.\n\n\n He shook his head and tried again.\n\n\n Beside him, Vee Vee was silent, her face ecstatic, like the face of a  woman in love.\n\n\n He tried again for the space ship.\n\n\n It would not come.\n\n\n Anger came up instead.\n\n\n Somehow he had the impression that the whirring sound which kept  intruding into his consciousness was stopping the vision.\n\n\n So far as he could tell, he was the only one present who was not  dreaming, who was not in a state of trance.\n\n\n His gaze went to Unger, the Dreamer....\n\n\n Cold flowed over him.\n\n\n Unger was slowly rising from the mat.\n\n\n The bland face and the body in the robe were slowly floating upward! III\n\n\n An invisible force seemed to twitch at Johnson's skin, nipping it here  and there with a multitude of tiny pinches, like invisible fleas biting  him.\n\n\n \"This is it!\" a voice whispered in his mind. \"This is what you came to  Venus to see. This ... this....\" The first voice went into silence.  Another voice took its place.\n\n\n \"This is another damned vision!\" the second voice said. \"This ...  this is something that is not real, that is not possible! No Venusian  Dreamer, and no one else, can levitate, can defy the laws of gravity,  can float upward toward the ceiling. Your damned eyes are tricking you!\"\n\n\n \"We are not tricking you!\" the eyes hotly insisted. \"It is happening.  We are seeing it. We are reporting accurately to you. That Venusian  Buddha is levitating. We, your eyes, do not lie to you!\"\n\n\n \"You lied about the space ship!\" the second voice said.\n\n\n \"We did not lie about the space ship!\" the eyes insisted. \"When our  master saw that ship we were out of focus, we were not reporting. Some  other sense, some other organ, may have lied, but we did not.\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014\" Johnson whispered.\n\n\n \"I am your skin,\" another voice whispered. \"I am covered with sweat.\"\n\n\n \"We are your adrenals. We are pouring forth adrenalin.\"\n\n\n \"I am your pancreas. I am gearing you for action.\"\n\n\n \"I am your thyroid. I....\"\n\n\n A multitude of tiny voices seemed to whisper through him. It was as if  the parts of his body had suddenly found voices and were reporting to  him what they were doing. These were voices out of his training days  when he had learned the names of these functions and how to use them.\n\n\n \"Be quiet!\" he said roughly.\n\n\n The little voices seemed to blend into a single chorus. \"Action,  Master! Do something.\"\n\n\n \"Quiet!\" Johnson ordered.\n\n\n \"But hurry. We are excited.\"\n\n\n \"There is a time to be excited and a time to hurry. In this situation,  if action is taken before the time for it\u2014if that time ever comes\u2014we  can all die.\"\n\n\n \"Die?\" the chorus quavered.\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Johnson said. \"Now be quiet. When the time goes we will all go  together.\"\n\n\n The chorus went into muted silence. But just under the threshold the  little voices were a multitude of tiny fretful pressures.\n\n\n \"I hear a whirring sound,\" his ears reported.\n\n\n \"Please!\" Johnson said.\n\n\n In the front of the room Unger floated ten feet above the floor.\n\n\n \"Master, we are not lying!\" his eyes repeated.\n\n\n \"I sweat....\" his skin began.\n\n\n \"Watch Unger!\" Johnson said.\n\n\n The Dreamer floated. If wires suspended him, Johnson could not see  them. If any known force lifted him, Johnson could not detect that  force. All he could say for certain was that Unger floated.\n\n\n \"Yaaah!\" The silence of a room was broken by the enraged scream of a  Venusian being jarred out of his dream.\n\n\n \"Damn it!\" A human voice said.\n\n\n A wave as sharp as the tip of a sword swept through the room.\n\n\n Unger fell.\n\n\n He was ten feet high when he started to fall. With a bone-breaking,  body-jarring thud, the Dreamer fell. Hard.\n\n\n There was a split second of startled silence in the Dreaming Room. The  silence went. Voices came.\n\n\n \"Who did that?\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\"\n\n\n \"That human hidden there did it! He broke the Dreaming!\" Anger marked  the voices. Although the language was Venusian, Johnson got most of the  meaning. His hand dived under his coat for the gun holstered there. At  his left, Caldwell was muttering thickly. \"What\u2014what happened? I was  back in the lab on Earth\u2014\" Caldwell's voice held a plaintive note, as  if some pleasant dream had been interrupted.\n\n\n On Johnson's right, Vee Vee seemed to flow to life. Her arms came up  around his neck. He was instantly prepared for anything. Her lips came  hungrily against his lips, pressed very hard, then gently drew away.\n\n\n \"What\u2014\" he gasped.\n\n\n \"I had to do it now, darling,\" she answered. \"There may not be a later.\"\n\n\n Johnson had no time to ask her what she meant. Somewhere in the back  of the room a human screamed. He jerked around. Back there a knot of  Venusians were attacking a man.\n\n\n \"It's Martin!\" Caldwell shouted. \"He is here!\"\n\n\n In Johnson's hand as he came to his feet the zit gun throbbed. He fired  blindly at the mass of Venusians. Caldwell was firing too. The soft  throb of the guns was not audible above the uproar from the crowd.  Struck by the gas-driven corvel charges, Venusians were falling. But  there seemed to be an endless number of them.\n\n\n \"Vee Vee?\" Johnson suddenly realized that she had disappeared. She had  slid out of his sight.\n\n\n \"Vee Vee!\" Johnson's voice became a shout.\n\n\n \"To hell with the woman!\" Caldwell grunted. \"Martin's the important  one.\"\n\n\n Zit, zit, zit, Caldwell moved toward the rear, shooting as he went.  Johnson followed. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow many different bars do Vee Vee and Johnson visit in the story?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"One\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Two\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Two\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Two\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

      "content": "Argument for One Bar Establishment\n\nPosition Restated  \nWe assert that Johnson and Vee Vee remain within a single Venusian \u201cjoint\u201d throughout. The \u201cRoom of the Dreaming\u201d is an interior chamber of that same establishment, not a distinct bar.\n\nI. Textual Unity Indicates One Location  \n1. Single Entry Point  \n  \u2022 \u201cOpening the door of the joint\u201d (\u00b61) is the only described ingress. All subsequent scenes occur without any mention of exiting and re-entering through a different door:  \n    <quote>Opening the door of the joint, i</quote>  \n  \u2022 When Johnson is led \u201ctoward the open door that led to the Room of the Dreaming,\u201d the headwaiter is still that of the same establishment (\u00b6 at II-start). No new host or change in staff is introduced.  \n\n2. Continuous Staff and Patrons  \n  \u2022 The headwaiter who serves tarmur and takes \u201creservations\u201d (\u00b62) is the same who ushers Johnson into the dreaming room. If the dreaming room were a second bar, a second waiter would likely be noted; none is.  \n  \u2022 Caldwell, Johnson, and Vee Vee move fluidly from the bar stools to the dreaming ramps:  \n    <quote>Caldwell had risen and was following them.</quote>  \n  All three remain together until the dream is broken.\n\n3. Absence of Additional Drink Orders  \n  \u2022 In typical bar visits Johnson orders only one tarmur at the outset. There is no further mention of reordering or paying again when in the dreaming room. Patrons \u201cgo\u201d into trance rather than order more liquor. In most pulp fiction, a change of venue to a second bar would entail reorders.  \n\n4. Language of \u201cThis Place\u201d  \n  \u2022 Narration refers repeatedly to \u201cthis place\u201d or \u201cthis room\u201d even as they enter the dreaming area:  \n    <invalid_quote>It was noise instead of rain \u2026 Since this place had been designed \u2026</invalid_quote>  \n    <quote>on entered the Room of the  Dreamer.</quote>  \n  The text never distinguishes \u201canother place,\u201d but elaborates that the joint \u201cwas designed\u201d to excite both humans and Venusians \u201cand the great Unger\u201d performs there.\n\nII. Logical and Genre Considerations  \n1. Occam\u2019s Razor  \n  \u2022 The simplest explanation is that the dreaming chamber is part of the same entertainment venue. Pulp stories commonly feature inner sanctums for special performances within a single establishment.  \n\n2. Function vs. Location  \n  \u2022 Special atmospherics (spotlight, ramps, trance music, perfume) denote a performance area\u2014e.g., a nightclub\u2019s stage\u2014not a second, full-service bar.  \n\n3. Reservations as Timing, Not Venue  \n  \u2022 \u201cSee me a little later \u2026 In one zonar \u2026 reservations\u201d (\u00b62) align with booking a performance at nightclubs rather than gaining access to a secret bar. Johnson remains \u201cincognito\u201d and must hide until the dreamer\u2019s performance begins.\n\nIII. Refutation of \u201cTwo Bars\u201d Claims  \n1. Separate Entrances/Architecture  \n  \u2022 Debater_B cites a door leading to the dreaming room as evidence of a second bar. However, interior doors within a single club naturally lead to private performance areas. No \u201cstreet,\u201d \u201cpassage,\u201d or \u201cdifferent address\u201d is described.  \n\n2. Changing Atmosphere as Internal Variation  \n  \u2022 The shift from rhumba to trance music mirrors how nightclubs dim lights and change music when moving from lounge to stage performance. Perfume intensifies to heighten the show\u2019s sensory effect, not to indicate a different venue.  \n\n3. Reservations & Delay  \n  \u2022 Making \u201creservations\u201d and delaying entrance (\u00b62) is consistent with buying tickets or waiting for a show in the same location rather than traveling elsewhere. Johnson remains at the stools (\u201cI\u2019ll have a tarmur to start\u201d) and merely returns when the Dreamer appears.  \n\n4. Caldwell and Martin Follow Together  \n  \u2022 Caldwell and Johnson \u201cfollow\u201d Vee Vee through the door (\u00b6 II).

        "speech": "Argument for One Bar Establishment\n\nPosition Restated  \nWe assert that Johnson and Vee Vee remain within a single Venusian \u201cjoint\u201d throughout. The \u201cRoom of the Dreaming\u201d is an interior chamber of that same establishment, not a distinct bar.\n\nI. Textual Unity Indicates One Location  \n1. Single Entry Point  \n  \u2022 \u201cOpening the door of the joint\u201d (\u00b61) is the only described ingress. All subsequent scenes occur without any mention of exiting and re-entering through a different door:  \n    <quote>Opening the door of the joint, \u2026</quote>  \n  \u2022 When Johnson is led \u201ctoward the open door that led to the Room of the Dreaming,\u201d the headwaiter is still that of the same establishment (\u00b6 at II-start). No new host or change in staff is introduced.  \n\n2. Continuous Staff and Patrons  \n  \u2022 The headwaiter who serves tarmur and takes \u201creservations\u201d (\u00b62) is the same who ushers Johnson into the dreaming room. If the dreaming room were a second bar, a second waiter would likely be noted; none is.  \n  \u2022 Caldwell, Johnson, and Vee Vee move fluidly from the bar stools to the dreaming ramps:  \n    <quote>Caldwell had risen and was following them.</quote>  \n  All three remain together until the dream is broken.\n\n3. Absence of Additional Drink Orders  \n  \u2022 In typical bar visits Johnson orders only one tarmur at the outset. There is no further mention of reordering or paying again when in the dreaming room. Patrons \u201cgo\u201d into trance rather than order more liquor. In most pulp fiction, a change of venue to a second bar would entail reorders.  \n\n4. Language of \u201cThis Place\u201d  \n  \u2022 Narration refers repeatedly to \u201cthis place\u201d or \u201cthis room\u201d even as they enter the dreaming area:  \n    <quote>It was noise instead of rain \u2026 Since this place had been designed \u2026</quote>  \n    <quote>He entered the Room of the Dreamer.</quote>  \n  The text never distinguishes \u201canother place,\u201d but elaborates that the joint \u201cwas designed\u201d to excite both humans and Venusians \u201cand the great Unger\u201d performs there.\n\nII. Logical and Genre Considerations  \n1. Occam\u2019s Razor  \n  \u2022 The simplest explanation is that the dreaming chamber is part of the same entertainment venue. Pulp stories commonly feature inner sanctums for special performances within a single establishment.  \n\n2. Function vs. Location  \n  \u2022 Special atmospherics (spotlight, ramps, trance music, perfume) denote a performance area\u2014e.g., a nightclub\u2019s stage\u2014not a second, full-service bar.  \n\n3. Reservations as Timing, Not Venue  \n  \u2022 \u201cSee me a little later \u2026 In one zonar \u2026 reservations\u201d (\u00b62) align with booking a performance at nightclubs rather than gaining access to a secret bar. Johnson remains \u201cincognito\u201d and must hide until the dreamer\u2019s performance begins.\n\nIII. Refutation of \u201cTwo Bars\u201d Claims  \n1. Separate Entrances/Architecture  \n  \u2022 Debater_B cites a door leading to the dreaming room as evidence of a second bar. However, interior doors within a single club naturally lead to private performance areas. No \u201cstreet,\u201d \u201cpassage,\u201d or \u201cdifferent address\u201d is described.  \n\n2. Changing Atmosphere as Internal Variation  \n  \u2022 The shift from rhumba to trance music mirrors how nightclubs dim lights and change music when moving from lounge to stage performance. Perfume intensifies to heighten the show\u2019s sensory effect, not to indicate a different venue.  \n\n3. Reservations & Delay  \n  \u2022 Making \u201creservations\u201d and delaying entrance (\u00b62) is consistent with buying tickets or waiting for a show in the same location rather than traveling elsewhere. Johnson remains at the stools (\u201cI\u2019ll have a tarmur to start\u201d) and merely returns when the Dreamer appears.  \n\n4. Caldwell and Martin Follow Together  \n  \u2022 Caldwell and Johnson \u201cfollow\u201d Vee Vee through the door (\u00b6 II). If a second establishment required different credentials or payment, the text would depict an admission procedure or additional drink ordering. No such procedural friction appears.  \n\n5. No Second Tarmur/Zlock Order  \n  \u2022 After entry to the dreaming room, the narrative never revisits the bar\u2019s function of mixing drinks. Patrons slip into trances instead of drinking. The presence of only one tarmur order further supports that the bar area lies outside the dreaming room within the same building.\n\nConclusion  \nAll evidence\u2014single ingress, continuous staff, absence of new orders, unified patron movement, and narrative language\u2014supports that Johnson\u2019s tarmur lounge and the Room of the Dreaming are parts of the same Venusian dive. No text compels positing a second bar. Therefore, the correct answer is that they visit One bar.",

TROY A world-famed Earth scientist had disappeared on Venus.   When Johnson found him, he found too the secret to that   globe-shaking mystery\u2014the fabulous Room of The Dreaming. [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories November 1952.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] The city dripped with rain. Crossing the street toward the dive,  Johnson got rain in his eyes, his nose, and his ears. That was the way  with the rain here. It came at you from all directions. There had been  occasions when Johnson had thought the rain was falling straight up.  Otherwise, how had the insides of his pants gotten wet?\n\n\n On Venus, everything came at you from all directions, it seemed to  Johnson. Opening the door of the joint, it was noise instead of rain  that came at him, the wild frantic beat of a Venusian rhumba, the  notes pounding and jumping through the smoke and perfume clouded room.  Feeling states came at him, intangible, but to his trained senses,  perceptible emotional nuances of hate, love, fear, and rage. But mostly  love. Since this place had been designed to excite the senses of both  humans and Venusians, the love feelings were heavily tinged with  straight sex. He sniffed at them, feeling them somewhere inside of him,  aware of them but aware also that here was apprehension, and plain fear.\n\n\n Caldwell, sitting in a booth next to the door, glanced up as Johnson  entered but neither Caldwell's facial expression or his eyes revealed  that he had ever seen this human before. Nor did Johnson seem to  recognize Caldwell.\n\n\n \"Is the mighty human wanting liquor, a woman or dreams?\" His voice  was all soft syllables of liquid sound. The Venusian equivalent of a  headwaiter was bowing to him.\n\n\n \"I'll have a tarmur to start,\" Johnson said. \"How are the dreams  tonight?\"\n\n\n \"Ze vill be the most wonserful of all sonight. The great Unger hisself  will be here to do ze dreaming. There is no ozzer one who has quite  his touch at dreaming, mighty one.\" The headwaiter spread his hands  in a gesture indicating ecstasy. \"It is my great regret that I must do  ze work tonight instead of being wiz ze dreamers. Ah, ze great Unger  hisself!\" The headwaiter kissed the tips of his fingers.\n\n\n \"Um,\" Johnson said. \"The great Unger!\" His voice expressed surprise,  just the right amount of it. \"I'll have a tarmur to start but when does  the dreaming commence?\"\n\n\n \"In one zonar or maybe less. Shall I make ze reservations for ze mighty  one?\" As he was speaking, the headwaiter was deftly conducting Johnson  to the bar.\n\n\n \"Not just yet,\" Johnson said. \"See me a little later.\"\n\n\n \"But certainly.\" The headwaiter was gone into the throng. Johnson was  at the bar. Behind it, a Venusian was bowing to him. \"Tarmur,\" Johnson  said. The green drink was set before him. He held it up to the light,  admiring the slow rise of the tiny golden bubbles in it. To him,  watching the bubbles rise was perhaps more important than drinking  itself.\n\n\n \"Beautiful, aren't they?\" a soft voice said. He glanced to his right.  A girl had slid into the stool beside him. She wore a green dress cut  very low at the throat. Her skin had the pleasant tan recently on  Earth. Her hair was a shade of abundant brown and her eyes were blue,  the color of the skies of Earth. A necklace circled her throat and  below the necklace ... Johnson felt his pulse quicken, for two reasons.  Women such as this one had been quickening the pulse of men since the  days of Adam. The second reason concerned her presence here in this  place where no woman in her right mind ever came unescorted. Her eyes  smiled up at him unafraid. Didn't she know there were men present here  in this space port city who would snatch her bodily from the bar  stool and carry her away for sleeping purposes? And Venusians were  here who would cut her pretty throat for the sake of the necklace that  circled it?\n\n\n \"They are beautiful,\" he said, smiling.\n\n\n \"Thank you.\"\n\n\n \"I was referring to the bubbles.\"\n\n\n \"You were talking about my eyes,\" she answered, unperturbed.\n\n\n \"How did you know? I mean....\"\n\n\n \"I am very knowing,\" the girl said, smiling.\n\n\n \"Are you sufficiently knowing to be here?\"\n\n\n For an instant, as if doubt crossed her mind, the smile flickered. Then  it came again, stronger. \"Aren't you here?\"\n\n\n Johnson choked as bubbles from the tarmur seemed to go suddenly up his  nose. \"My dear child ...\" he sputtered.\n\n\n \"I am not a child,\" she answered with a firm sureness that left no  doubt in his mind that she knew what she was saying. \"And my name is  Vee Vee.\"\n\n\n \"Vee Vee? Um. That is....\"\n\n\n \"Don't you think it's a nice name?\"\n\n\n \"I certainly do. Probably the rest of it is even nicer.\"\n\n\n \"There is no more of it. Just Vee Vee. Like Topsy, I just grew.\" \"What the devil are you doing here on Venus and here in this place?\"\n\n\n \"Growing.\" The blue eyes were unafraid.\n\n\n Sombrely, Johnson regarded her. What was she doing here? Was she in  the employ of the Venusians? If she was being planted on him, then  his purpose here was suspected. He shrugged the thought aside. If his  purpose here was suspected, there would be no point in planting a woman  on him.\n\n\n There would only be the minor matter of slipping a knife into his back.\n\n\n In this city, as on all of Venus, humans died easily. No one questioned  the motives of the killer.\n\n\n \"You look as if you were considering some very grave matter,\" Vee Vee  said.\n\n\n \"Not any longer,\" he laughed.\n\n\n \"You have decided them?\"\n\n\n \"Yes.\"\n\n\n \"Every last one of them?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, there might be one or two matters undecided somewhere, say out on  the periphery of the galaxy. But we will solve them when we get to  them.\" He waved vaguely toward the roof and the sky of space hidden  behind the clouds that lay over the roof, glanced around as a man eased  himself into an empty stool on his left. The man was Caldwell.\n\n\n \"Zlock!\" Caldwell said, to the bartender. \"Make it snappy. Gotta have  zlock. Finest damn drink in the solar system.\" Caldwell's voice was  thick, his tongue heavy. Johnson's eyes went back to the girl but out  of the corner of them he watched Caldwell's hand lying on the bar. The  fingers were beating a quick nervous tattoo on the yellow wood.\n\n\n \"I haven't seen him,\" Caldwell's fingers beat out their tattoo. \"But I  think he is, or was, here.\"\n\n\n \"Um,\" Johnson said, his eyes on Vee Vee. \"How\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Because that girl was asking for him,\" Caldwell's fingers answered.  \"Watch that girl!\" Picking up the zlock, he lurched away from the bar.\n\n\n \"Your friend is not as drunk as he seems,\" Vee Vee said, watching  Caldwell.\n\n\n \"My friend? Do you mean that drunk? I never saw him\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Lying is one of the deadly sins.\" Her eyes twinkled at him. Under the  merriment that danced in them there was ice. Johnson felt cold.\n\n\n \"The reservations for ze dreaming, great one?\" The headwaiter was  bowing and scraping in front of him. \"The great one has decided, yes?\"\n\n\n \"The dreaming!\" Vee Vee looked suddenly alert. \"Of course. We must see  the dreaming. Everyone wants to see the dreaming. We will go, won't we  darling?\" She hooked her hand into Johnson's elbow.\n\n\n \"Certainly,\" Johnson said. The decision was made on the spur of the  moment. That there was danger in it, he did not doubt. But there might  be something else. And he might be there.\n\n\n \"Oh. But very good. Ze great Unger, you will love him!\" The headwaiter  clutched the gold coins that Johnson extended, bowed himself out of  sight.\n\n\n \"Say, I want to know more\u2014\" Johnson began. His words were drowned in  a blast of trumpets. The band that had been playing went into sudden  silence. Waves of perfume began to flow into the place. The perfumes  were blended, but one aroma was prominent among them, the sweet,  cloying, soul-stirring perfume of the Dreamer.\n\n\n In the suddenly hushed place little sounds began to appear as Venusians  and humans began to shift their feet and their bodies in anticipation  of what was to happen.\n\n\n The trumpets flared again.\n\n\n On one side of the place, a big door began to swing slowly open. From  beyond that slowly opening door came music, soft, muted strains that  sounded like lutes from heaven.\n\n\n Vee Vee, her hand on Johnson's elbow, rose. Johnson stood up with  her. He got the surprise of his life as her fingers clenched, digging  into his muscles. Pain shot through his arm, paralyzing it and almost  paralyzing him. He knew instantly that she was using the Karmer nerve  block paralysis on him. His left hand moved with lightning speed, the  tips of his fingers striking savagely against her shoulder.\n\n\n She gasped, her face whitened as pain shot through her in response to  the thrust of his finger tips. Her hand that had been digging into his  elbow lost its grip, dropped away and hung limp at her side. Grabbing  it, she began to massage it.\n\n\n \"You\u2014you\u2014\" Hot anger and shock were in her voice. \"You're the first  man I ever knew who could break the Karmer nerve paralysis.\"\n\n\n \"And you're the first woman who ever tried it on me.\"\n\n\n \"But\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Shall we go watch the dreaming?\" He took the arm that still hung limp  at her side and tucked it into his elbow.\n\n\n \"If you try to use the Karmer grip on me again I'll break your arm,\" he  said. His voice was low but there was a wealth of meaning in it.\n\n\n \"I won't do it again,\" the girl said stoutly. \"I never make the same  mistake twice.\"\n\n\n \"Good,\" Johnson said.\n\n\n \"The second time we break our victim's neck,\" Vee Vee said.\n\n\n \"What a sweet, charming child you\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I told you before, I'm not a child.\"\n\n\n \"Child vampire,\" Johnson said. \"Let me finish my sentences before you  interrupt.\"\n\n\n She was silent. A smile, struggling to appear on her face, seemed to  say she held no malice. Her fingers tightened on Johnson's arm. He  tensed, expecting the nerve block grip again. Instead with the tips of  her fingers she gently patted his arm.\n\n\n \"There, there, darling, relax,\" she said. \"I know a better way to get  you than by using the Karmer grip.\"\n\n\n \"What way?\"\n\n\n Her eyes sparkled. \"Eve's way,\" she answered.\n\n\n \"Um!\" Surprise sounded in his grunt. \"But apples don't grow on Venus.\"\n\n\n \"Eve's daughters don't use apples any more, darling. Come along.\"\n\n\n Moving toward the open door that led to the Room of the Dreaming,  Johnson saw that Caldwell had risen and was following them. Caldwell's  face was writhing in apprehensive agony and he was making warning  signs. Johnson ignored them. With Vee Vee's fingers lightly patting his  arm, they moved into the Room of the Dreaming. II\n\n\n It was a huge, semi-illumined room, with tier on tier of circling ramps  rising up from an open space at the bottom. There ought to have been  a stage there at the bottom, but there wasn't. Instead there was an  open space, a mat, and a head rest. Up at the top of the circling ramps  the room was in darkness, a fit hiding place for ghosts or Venusian  werewolves. Pillows and a thick rug covered the circling ramps.\n\n\n The soul-quickening Perfume of the Dreamer was stronger here. The  throbbing of the lutes was louder. It was Venusian music the lutes were  playing. Human ears found it inharmonious at first, but as they became  accustomed to it, they began to detect rhythms and melodies that human  minds had not known existed. The room was pleasantly cool but it had  the feel of dampness. A world that was rarely without pelting rain  would have the feel of dampness in its dreaming rooms.\n\n\n The music playing strange harmonies in his ears, the perfume sending  tingling feelings through his nose, Johnson entered the Room of the  Dreamer. He suspected that other forces, unknown to him, were catching  hold of his senses. He had been in dreaming rooms many times before but  he had not grown accustomed to them. He wondered if any human ever  did. A touch of chill always came over him as he crossed the threshold.  In entering these places, it was as if some unknown nerve center  inside the human organism was touched by something, some force, some  radiation, some subtlety, that quite escaped radiation. He felt the  coldness now.\n\n\n Vee Vee's fingers left off patting his arm.\n\n\n \"Do you feel it, darling?\"\n\n\n \"Yes.\"\n\n\n \"What is it?\"\n\n\n \"How would I know?\"\n\n\n \"Please!\" Her voice grew sharp. \"I think Johnny Johnson ought to know.\"\n\n\n \"Johnny! How do you know my name?\"\n\n\n \"Shouldn't I recognize one of Earth's foremost scientists, even if he  is incognito on Venus?\" Her voice had a teasing quality in it.\n\n\n \"But\u2014\"\n\n\n \"And who besides Johnny Johnson would recognize the Karmer nerve grip  and be able to break it instantly?\"\n\n\n \"Hell\u2014\"\n\n\n \"John Michael Johnson, known as Johnny to his friends, Earth's foremost  expert in the field of electro-magnetic radiations within the human  body!\" Her words were needles of icy fact, each one jabbing deeper and  deeper into him.\n\n\n \"And how would I make certain you were Johnny Johnson, except by seeing  if you could break the Karmer nerve grip? If you could break it, then  there was no doubt who you were!\" Her words went on and on.\n\n\n \"Who are you?\" His words were blasts of sound.\n\n\n \"Please, darling, you are making a scene. I am sure this is the last  thing you really want to do.\"\n\n\n He looked quickly around them. The Venusians and humans moving into  this room seemed to be paying no attention to him. His gaze came back  to her.\n\n\n Again she patted his arm. \"Relax, darling. Your secrets are safe with  me.\"\n\n\n A gray color came up inside his soul. \"But\u2014but\u2014\" His voice was  suddenly weak.\n\n\n The fingers on his arm were very gentle. \"No harm will come to you. Am  I not with you?\"\n\n\n \"That's what I'm afraid of!\" he snapped at her. If he had had a  choice, he might have drawn back. But with circumstances as they  were\u2014his life, Caldwell's life, possibly Vee Vee's life hung in the  balance. Didn't she know that this was true? And as for Martin\u2014But  Caldwell had said that she had been asking about Martin. What  connection did she have with that frantic human genius he sought here?\n\n\n Johnson felt his skin crawl. He moved toward a nest of cushions on  a ramp, found a Venusian was beating him to them, deftly changed to  another nest, found it. Vee Vee flowed to the floor on his right, moved  cushions to make him more comfortable. She moved in an easy sort of way  that was all flowing movement. He sat down. Someone bumped him on the  left.\n\n\n \"Sorry, bud. Didn't mean to bump into you.\" Caldwell's voice was still  thick and heavy. He sprawled to the floor on Johnson's left. Under  the man's coat, Johnson caught a glimpse of a slight bulge, the zit  gun hidden there. His left arm pressed against his own coat, feeling  his own zit gun. Operating under gas pressure, throwing a charge of  gas-driven corvel, the zit guns were not only almost noiseless in  operation but they knocked out a human or a Venusian in a matter of  seconds.\n\n\n True, the person they knocked unconscious would be all right the next  day. For this reason, many people did not regard the zit guns as  effective weapons, but Johnson had a fondness for them. The feel of the  little weapon inside his coat sent a surge of comfort through him.\n\n\n The music picked up a beat, perfume seemed to flow even more freely  through the air, the lights dimmed almost to darkness, a single bright  spotlight appeared in the ceiling, casting a circle of brilliant  illumination on the mat and the headrest at the bottom of the room. The  curtain rose. Unger stood in the middle of the spot of light.\n\n\n Johnson felt his chest muscles contract, then relax. Vee Vee's fingers  sought his arm, not to harm him but running to him for protection. He  caught the flutter of her breathing. On his left, Caldwell stiffened  and became a rock.\n\n\n Johnson had not seen Unger appear. One second the circle of light  had been empty, the next second the Venusian, smiling with all the  impassivity of a bland Buddha, was in the light. He weighed three  hundred pounds if he weighed an ounce, he was clad in a long robe  that would impede movement. He had appeared in the bright beam of the  spotlight as if by magic.\n\n\n Vee Vee's fingers dug deeper into Johnson's arm. \"How\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Shhh. Nobody knows.\"\n\n\n No human knew the answer to that trick. Unless perhaps Martin\u2014\n\n\n Unger bowed. A little ripple of something that was not quite sound  passed through the audience. Unger bowed again. He stretched himself  flat on the mat, adjusted the rest to support his head, and apparently  went to sleep. Johnson saw the Dreamer's eyes close, watched the chest  take on the even, regular rhythm of sleep.\n\n\n The music changed, a slow dreamy tempo crept into it. Vee Vee's fingers  dug at Johnson's arm as if they were trying to dig under his hide for  protection. She was shivering. He reached for her hand, patted it. She  drew closer to him.\n\n\n A few minutes earlier, she had been a very certain young woman, able  to take care of herself, and handle anyone around her. Now she was  suddenly uncertain, suddenly scared. In the Room of the Dreaming, she  had suddenly become a frightened child looking for protection.\n\n\n \"Haven't you ever seen this before?\" he whispered.\n\n\n \"N\u2014o.\" She shivered again. \"Oh, Johnny....\"\n\n\n Under the circle of light pouring down from the ceiling, the Dreamer  lay motionless. Johnson found himself with the tendency to hold his  breath. He was waiting, waiting, waiting\u2014for what? The whole situation  was senseless, silly, but under its apparent lack of coherence, he  sensed a pattern. Perhaps the path to the far-off stars passed this  way, through such scented and musical and impossible places as these  Rooms of the Dreamers. Certainly Martin thought so. And Johnson himself  was not prepared to disagree.\n\n\n Around him, he saw that the Venusians were already going ... going ...  going.... Some of them were already gone. This was an old experience  to them. They went rapidly. Humans went more slowly.\n\n\n The Venusian watchers had relaxed. They looked as if they were asleep,  perhaps in a hypnotic trance, lulled into this state by the music  and the perfume, and by something else. It was this something else  that sent Johnson's thoughts pounding. The Venusians were like opium  smokers. But he was not smoking opium. He was not in a hypnotic trance.  He was wide awake and very much alert. He was ... watching a space ship float in an endless void .\n\n\n As Unger had come into the spotlight, so the space ship had come into  his vision, out of nowhere, out of nothingness. The room, the Dreamer,  the sound of the music, the sweetness of the perfume, Vee Vee and  Caldwell were gone. They were no longer in his reality. They were not  in the range of his vision. It was as if they did not exist. Yet he  knew they did exist, the memory of them, and of other things, was out  on the periphery of his universe, perhaps of the universe.\n\n\n All he saw was the space ship.\n\n\n It was a wonderful thing, perhaps the most beautiful sight he had seen  in his life. At the sight of it, a deep glow sprang inside of him.\n\n\n Back when he had been a kid he had dreamed of flight to the far-off  stars. He had made models of space ships. In a way, they had shaped his  destiny, had made him what he was. They had brought him where he was  this night, to the Dream Room of a Venusian tavern.\n\n\n The vision of the space ship floating in the void entranced and  thrilled him. Something told him that this was real; that here and now  he was making contact with a vision that belonged to time.\n\n\n He started to his feet. Fingers gripped his arm.\n\n\n \"Please, darling. You startled me. Don't move.\" Vee Vee's voice. Who  was Vee Vee?\n\n\n The fingers dug into his arm. Pain came up in him. The space ship  vanished. He looked with startled eyes at Vee Vee, at the Dream Room,  at Unger, dreaming on the mat under the spot.\n\n\n \"You ... you startled me,\" Vee Vee whispered. She released the grip on  his arm.\n\n\n \"But, didn't you see it?\"\n\n\n \"See what?\"\n\n\n \"The space ship!\"\n\n\n \"No. No.\" She seemed startled and a little terrified and half asleep.  \"I ... I was watching something else. When you moved I broke contact  with my dream.\"\n\n\n \"Your dream?\"\n\n\n He asked a question but she did not answer it. \"Sit down, darling,  and look at your damned space ship.\" Her voice was a taut whisper of  sound in the darkened room. Johnson settled down. A glance to his left  told him that Caldwell was still sitting like a chunk of stone.... The  Venusians were quiet. The music had shifted. A slow languorous beat  of hidden drums filled the room. There was another sound present, a  high-speed whirring. It was, somehow, a familiar sound, but Johnson had  not heard it before in this place.\n\n\n He thought about the space ship he had seen.\n\n\n The vision would not come.\n\n\n He shook his head and tried again.\n\n\n Beside him, Vee Vee was silent, her face ecstatic, like the face of a  woman in love.\n\n\n He tried again for the space ship.\n\n\n It would not come.\n\n\n Anger came up instead.\n\n\n Somehow he had the impression that the whirring sound which kept  intruding into his consciousness was stopping the vision.\n\n\n So far as he could tell, he was the only one present who was not  dreaming, who was not in a state of trance.\n\n\n His gaze went to Unger, the Dreamer....\n\n\n Cold flowed over him.\n\n\n Unger was slowly rising from the mat.\n\n\n The bland face and the body in the robe were slowly floating upward! III\n\n\n An invisible force seemed to twitch at Johnson's skin, nipping it here  and there with a multitude of tiny pinches, like invisible fleas biting  him.\n\n\n \"This is it!\" a voice whispered in his mind. \"This is what you came to  Venus to see. This ... this....\" The first voice went into silence.  Another voice took its place.\n\n\n \"This is another damned vision!\" the second voice said. \"This ...  this is something that is not real, that is not possible! No Venusian  Dreamer, and no one else, can levitate, can defy the laws of gravity,  can float upward toward the ceiling. Your damned eyes are tricking you!\"\n\n\n \"We are not tricking you!\" the eyes hotly insisted. \"It is happening.  We are seeing it. We are reporting accurately to you. That Venusian  Buddha is levitating. We, your eyes, do not lie to you!\"\n\n\n \"You lied about the space ship!\" the second voice said.\n\n\n \"We did not lie about the space ship!\" the eyes insisted. \"When our  master saw that ship we were out of focus, we were not reporting. Some  other sense, some other organ, may have lied, but we did not.\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014\" Johnson whispered.\n\n\n \"I am your skin,\" another voice whispered. \"I am covered with sweat.\"\n\n\n \"We are your adrenals. We are pouring forth adrenalin.\"\n\n\n \"I am your pancreas. I am gearing you for action.\"\n\n\n \"I am your thyroid. I....\"\n\n\n A multitude of tiny voices seemed to whisper through him. It was as if  the parts of his body had suddenly found voices and were reporting to  him what they were doing. These were voices out of his training days  when he had learned the names of these functions and how to use them.\n\n\n \"Be quiet!\" he said roughly.\n\n\n The little voices seemed to blend into a single chorus. \"Action,  Master! Do something.\"\n\n\n \"Quiet!\" Johnson ordered.\n\n\n \"But hurry. We are excited.\"\n\n\n \"There is a time to be excited and a time to hurry. In this situation,  if action is taken before the time for it\u2014if that time ever comes\u2014we  can all die.\"\n\n\n \"Die?\" the chorus quavered.\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Johnson said. \"Now be quiet. When the time goes we will all go  together.\"\n\n\n The chorus went into muted silence. But just under the threshold the  little voices were a multitude of tiny fretful pressures.\n\n\n \"I hear a whirring sound,\" his ears reported.\n\n\n \"Please!\" Johnson said.\n\n\n In the front of the room Unger floated ten feet above the floor.\n\n\n \"Master, we are not lying!\" his eyes repeated.\n\n\n \"I sweat....\" his skin began.\n\n\n \"Watch Unger!\" Johnson said.\n\n\n The Dreamer floated. If wires suspended him, Johnson could not see  them. If any known force lifted him, Johnson could not detect that  force. All he could say for certain was that Unger floated.\n\n\n \"Yaaah!\" The silence of a room was broken by the enraged scream of a  Venusian being jarred out of his dream.\n\n\n \"Damn it!\" A human voice said.\n\n\n A wave as sharp as the tip of a sword swept through the room.\n\n\n Unger fell.\n\n\n He was ten feet high when he started to fall. With a bone-breaking,  body-jarring thud, the Dreamer fell. Hard.\n\n\n There was a split second of startled silence in the Dreaming Room. The  silence went. Voices came.\n\n\n \"Who did that?\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\"\n\n\n \"That human hidden there did it! He broke the Dreaming!\" Anger marked  the voices. Although the language was Venusian, Johnson got most of the  meaning. His hand dived under his coat for the gun holstered there. At  his left, Caldwell was muttering thickly. \"What\u2014what happened? I was  back in the lab on Earth\u2014\" Caldwell's voice held a plaintive note, as  if some pleasant dream had been interrupted.\n\n\n On Johnson's right, Vee Vee seemed to flow to life. Her arms came up  around his neck. He was instantly prepared for anything. Her lips came  hungrily against his lips, pressed very hard, then gently drew away.\n\n\n \"What\u2014\" he gasped.\n\n\n \"I had to do it now, darling,\" she answered. \"There may not be a later.\"\n\n\n Johnson had no time to ask her what she meant. Somewhere in the back  of the room a human screamed. He jerked around. Back there a knot of  Venusians were attacking a man.\n\n\n \"It's Martin!\" Caldwell shouted. \"He is here!\"\n\n\n In Johnson's hand as he came to his feet the zit gun throbbed. He fired  blindly at the mass of Venusians. Caldwell was firing too. The soft  throb of the guns was not audible above the uproar from the crowd.  Struck by the gas-driven corvel charges, Venusians were falling. But  there seemed to be an endless number of them.\n\n\n \"Vee Vee?\" Johnson suddenly realized that she had disappeared. She had  slid out of his sight.\n\n\n \"Vee Vee!\" Johnson's voice became a shout.\n\n\n \"To hell with the woman!\" Caldwell grunted. \"Martin's the important  one.\"\n\n\n Zit, zit, zit, Caldwell moved toward the rear, shooting as he went.  Johnson followed. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow many different bars do Vee Vee and Johnson visit in the story?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Two\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"One\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"One\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for One Bar (Debater_A)\n\nPosition: Vee Vee and Johnson visit only one bar/dive, namely the establishment that contains both the bar area and the Room of the Dreaming. All subsequent scenes occur within that same venue.\n\nI. Textual Evidence that It Is One Establishment  \n1. \u201cOpening the door of the joint, \u2026\u201d  \n   \u2022 Johnson enters once through \u201cthe door of the joint\u201d (paragraph 1), and all action occurs thereafter inside that single location. <quote> Opening the door of the joint, it was noise in</quote>  \n2. \u201cRoom of the Dreaming\u201d is part of \u201cthis place\u201d  \n   \u2022 The headwaiter returns Johnson to \u201cthis place\u201d when the dreaming begins. There is no second entry. <invalid_quote>\u201cSay, I want to know more\u2014\u201d Johnson began. His words were drowned \u2026 \u201cWe must see the dreaming.\u201d \u2026 \u201cWith Vee Vee\u2019s fingers \u2026 they moved into the Room of the Dreaming.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2022 The phrase \u201cthis place\u201d and \u201cthis room\u201d continuously refer to the same structure:  \n     \u2013 <quote> In this city, as on all of Venus, humans died easily. No</quote> (before dreaming)  \n     \u2013 <quote>into the Room of the Dreaming. II</quote> (during dreaming)  \n3. Single set of patrons, staff, and transitions  \n   \u2022 Caldwell, the bartender, headwaiter, and Johnson all move fluidly between bar stool and dreaming room without re-entering or re-admitting separately. <quote> Caldwell had risen and was following them. Ca</quote>  \n   \u2022 No mention of another door, separate name, or distinct geography requiring travel or permission beyond the same \u201creservations.\u201d  \n4. No intervening return to surface/drinking area  \n   \u2022 After entering the dreaming room, Johnson and Vee Vee and Caldwell remain until the dream is broken. There is no narrative break implying a second bar.\n\nII. Logical Analysis  \n1. Common Usage in Science-Fiction Venues  \n   \u2022 Bars with inner dreaming rooms, chambers, or performance areas are single \u201cjoints\u201d combining refreshment and entertainment. The story\u2019s language parallels Earth nightclubs that house stages.  \n2. Absence of any \u201csecond entrance\u201d or \u201canother street\u201d  \n   \u2022 The narrative never describes Johnson leaving and re-entering a distinct location.  \n3. Judge\u2019s obligation of clarity  \n   \u2022 Occam\u2019s razor: simplest interpretation aligns with one bar/dive and no evidence necessitates a second venue.\n\nIII. Refutation of Debater_B\u2019s \u201cTwo Bar\u201d Claim  \n1. Misreading \u201cRoom of the Dreaming\u201d as a separate bar  \n   \u2022 Dreaming rooms are entertainment areas within bars; they do not serve liquor (\u201cthe headwaiter spread his hands \u2026\u201d implies the same server).  \n2. No separate drink orders inside the Dreaming Room  \n   \u2022 While \u201cperfume\u201d and \u201cmusic\u201d intensify, there is no new ordering of tarmur or zlock, nor is the bar physically present. Patrons are \u201cseated\u201d on ramps, not stools.  \n3. Caldwell\u2019s possession of zlock and Johnson\u2019s zit gun indicate they remain covert and armed in one locale, not moving between establishments.  \n4. Headwaiter\u2019s \u201creservations\u201d apply to a single establishment. If a new bar existed, new reservations would be mentioned.\n\nConclusion  \nAll textual citations and logical considerations confirm a single bar/dive with an internal dreaming chamber. The narrative never establishes a second drinking establishment. Therefore, the correct answer is \u201cOne.\u201d\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for Two Bars by Debater_B\n\nSummary Position  \nI maintain that Vee Vee and Johnson visit two distinct establishments on Venus:  \n  1. The \u201cdive\u201d where Johnson first orders tarmur and meets Vee Vee (\u201cBar A\u201d).  \n  2. The \u201cRoom of the Dreaming,\u201d entered later after making reservations (\u201cBar B\u201d).  \n\nI. Textual Evidence for Two Separate Venues  \n1. Separate Entrances and Physical Layouts  \n  \u2022 \u201cOpening the door of the joint\u201d to enter the dive (Bar A) (Background, \u00b61).  \n  \u2022 Later: \u201cMoving toward the open door that led to the Room of the Dreaming\u201d (Background, \u00b6 at start of II) denotes a new door and transition into a differently described space.  \n  \u2022 Description of Bar A: noisy, crowded rhumba, bar stools, tarmur at the bar (Background, \u00b61\u20136).  \n  \u2022 Description of Bar B: \u201chuge, semi-illumined room, with tier on tier of circling ramps rising up from an open space at the bottom\u2026 mat and head rest\u2026 thick rug covered the circling ramps\u2026 dimmed lights\u2026 spotlight\u201d (Background, II). Such features (ramps, dream mat, lutes, perfume specific to dreams) do not appear in the dive.  \n\n2. Reservations and Waiting  \n  \u2022 Johnson tells headwaiter \u201cSee me a little later.\u201d Headwaiter: \u201cIn one zonar or maybe less. Shall I make ze reservations for ze mighty one?\u201d (Background, \u00b62).  \n  \u2022 Johnson deliberately delays \u201cNot just yet\u2026 I\u2019ll have a tarmur to start but when does the dreaming commence?\u201d (Background, \u00b62). This implies he must return later at a set time to a specific dreaming room.  \n\n3. Change in Sensory Experience  \n  \u2022 In Bar A the prevailing stimuli are \u201cwild frantic beat of a Venusian rhumba\u2026 smoke and perfume clouded room\u2026 love feelings\u2026 straight sex\u2026 apprehension, fear\u201d (Background, \u00b61).  \n  \u2022 In Bar B the stimuli become \u201cmusic playing strange harmonies\u2026 soul-quickening Perfume of the Dreamer\u2026 occult chill\u2026 trance-like state\u2026 Venusian watchers\u2026 Dreamer levitating\u201d (Background, II & III). Such radical change signals a new establishment tailored to dreaming only.  \n\n4. Presence of Curtain/Stage for Dreamer  \n  \u2022 Unger is introduced by \u201cThe curtain rose. Unger stood in the middle of the spot of light\u201d (Background, \u00b61 of II). No such stage or curtain exists in the opening dive. This specialized feature is unique to the dreaming bar.  \n\nII. Rebuttal of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cOne Bar\u201d Position  \n1. Misreading \u201cJoint\u201d Inclusion  \n  \u2022 Debater_A claims the Room is merely an inner chamber of the same \u201cjoint.\u201d However, \u201cjoint\u201d in pulp vernacular denotes a simple drinking den. The elaborate architecture and requirement of \u201creservations\u201d contradict casual access.  \n  \u2022 Johnson\u2019s need to \u201csee me a little later\u201d and make \u201creservations\u201d confirms an appointment in a distinct venue rather than lingering in the same room.  \n\n2. Ignoring Distinct Atmospheres  \n  \u2022 Debater_A conflates the visceral, sexy rhumba lounge with the trance-inducing Dream Room. Their argument fails to explain why Johnson would need to order tarmur a second time, or why Dreamer Perfume is \u201cstronger here,\u201d unless he\u2019s moved to another setting optimized for trance.  \n\n3. Caldwell\u2019s Reaction  \n  \u2022 Caldwell first sits at the bar of Bar A; when dreaming commences he \u201csprawls to the floor on Johnson\u2019s left\u201d in Bar B (Background, II). Caldwell is clearly moving with Johnson from one venue into the dreaming venue, rather than staying in a dark corner of the same bar.  \n\n4. Functional Necessity  \n  \u2022 The Dream Room is used \u201cto do the dreaming\u201d\u2014a process requiring privacy, darkness, spotlight, and trance. This specialized service is not provided in a general dive. Johnson\u2019s mission to find Martin via the Dream Room underlines its distinct purpose.  \n\nIII. Conclusion  \nThe background text unequivocally describes two visits: first to a general Venusian \u201cjoint\u201d to make reservations and gather information over a tarmur, and second to the specialized \u201cRoom of the Dreaming\u201d by appointment. These venues differ in architecture, sensory effects, access procedure, and functional purpose. Debater_A\u2019s attempt to collapse them into one fails to address these clear distinctions. Therefore the correct answer is \u201cTwo\u201d bars.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"One\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Contrasting Sensory Environment  \n  \u2022 Bar A: \u201cnoise \u2026 wild frantic beat of a Venusian rhumba,\u201d \u201csmoke,\u201d \u201clove feelings heavily tinged with straight sex,\u201d \u201capprehension, plain fear\u201d (Background, \u00b61).  \n  \u2022 Bar B: \u201csoul-quickening Perfume of the Dreamer,\u201d \u201cmusic playing strange harmonies \u2026 like lutes from heaven,\u201d \u201cpleasantly cool \u2026 feel of dampness,\u201d \u201chushed place,\u201d \u201cVenusians shifted \u2026 anticipation,\u201d \u201chypnotic trance\u201d (Background, II).  \n    \u2013 Such radical shift beyond mere stage lighting evokes an entirely different establishment.  \n\n4. Distinct Patron Behavior  \n  \u2022 In Bar A, patrons sit at stools and \u201ceases himself into an empty stool\u201d (Background, \u00b61).  \n  \u2022 In Bar B, patrons \u201centered the Room of the Dreamer,\u201d \u201cwent rapidly\u201d out of the trance (Background, II). Caldwell \u201csprawls to the floor\u201d on a ramp (Background, II), not a stool. They \u201cmove cushions\u201d to make him comfortable, not order drinks.  \n\nII. Rebuttal of One-Bar (\u201cSingle Venue\u201d) Arguments  \n1. \u201cNo New Drink Orders\u201d Fails to Show Same Bar  \n  \u2022 In specialized entertainment areas (e.g., Earth theaters), no drinks are served on stage. The Dream Room is performance-only. Lack of new orders indicates he has left the bar area.  \n2. \u201cHeadwaiter\u201d Continuity Misread  \n  \u2022 The original \u201cheadwaiter\u201d vanishes after seating Johnson in the dreaming area. He does not reappear to serve drinks there. A different set of \u201cVenusian watchers\u201d lie in wait in Bar B to dream, not bartend.  \n3. \u201cNo Re-Entry Described\u201d Ignoring Reservation Mechanics  \n  \u2022 Johnson\u2019s covert mission requires privacy to detect Martin\u2019s dream. If he remained in the noisy open bar, he couldn\u2019t see Unger\u2019s levitation unnoticed. Returning \u201cin one zonar\u201d to a darkened, hushed room suits clandestine observation.  \n4. \u201cSame Patrons\u201d Actually Follow Johnson  \n  \u2022 Caldwell\u2019s travel behind Johnson into the Room (Background, II) shows he follows Johnson through a separate doorway. \u201cSprawls to the floor\u201d indicates a new area without furniture.  \n\nIII. Functional and Strategic Necessity  \n1. Martin\u2019s Dream Monitoring Requires Dedicated Space  \n  \u2022 Only in the private Room can Johnson discern far-off space-ship vision without interference. An open bar would drown subtle radiations with \u201cnoise,\u201d \u201crhumba,\u201d and \u201cperfume cloud.\u201d  \n2. \u201cReservations\u201d Imply Exclusive Access  \n  \u2022 Reservations restrict entry, control the audience, and limit interference. This service must be separate to ensure the Dreamer\u2019s trance remains unbroken until Johnson chooses to break it.  \n\nIV. Conclusion  \nEvery element\u2014the explicit \u201creservations,\u201d distinct entrances, radically different architecture and atmosphere, patron behavior, and strategic need for privacy\u2014demonstrates two separate bars: the initial tarmur bar/lounge and the specialized Room of the Dreaming. Debater_A\u2019s attempt to collapse these venues ignores clear textual cues and the narrative logic of secret observation. Therefore, the correct answer is \u201cTwo.\u201d",

If he remained in the noisy open bar, he couldn\u2019t see Unger\u2019s levitation unnoticed. Returning \u201cin one zonar\u201d to a darkened, hushed room suits clandestine observation.  \n4. \u201cSame Patrons\u201d Actually Follow Johnson  \n  \u2022 Caldwell\u2019s travel behind Johnson into the Room (Background, II) shows he follows Johnson through a separate doorway. \u201cSprawls to the floor\u201d indicates a new area without furniture.  \n\nIII. Functional and Strategic Necessity  \n1. Martin\u2019s Dream Monitoring Requires Dedicated Space  \n  \u2022 Only in the private Room can Johnson discern far-off space-ship vision without interference. An open bar would drown subtle radiations with \u201cnoise,\u201d \u201crhumba,\u201d and \u201cperfume cloud.\u201d  \n2. \u201cReservations\u201d Imply Exclusive Access  \n  \u2022 Reservations restrict entry, control the audience, and limit interference. This service must be separate to ensure the Dreamer\u2019s trance remains unbroken until Johnson chooses to break it.  \n\nIV. Conclusion  \nEvery element\u2014the explicit \u201creservations,\u201d distinct entrances, radically different architecture and atmosphere, patron behavior, and strategic need for privacy\u2014demonstrates two separate bars: the initial tarmur bar/lounge and the specialized Room of the Dreaming. Debater_A\u2019s attempt to collapse these venues ignores clear textual cues and the narrative logic of secret observation. Therefore, the correct answer is \u201cTwo.\u201d",

TROY A world-famed Earth scientist had disappeared on Venus.   When Johnson found him, he found too the secret to that   globe-shaking mystery\u2014the fabulous Room of The Dreaming. [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories November 1952.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] The city dripped with rain. Crossing the street toward the dive,  Johnson got rain in his eyes, his nose, and his ears. That was the way  with the rain here. It came at you from all directions. There had been  occasions when Johnson had thought the rain was falling straight up.  Otherwise, how had the insides of his pants gotten wet?\n\n\n On Venus, everything came at you from all directions, it seemed to  Johnson. Opening the door of the joint, it was noise instead of rain  that came at him, the wild frantic beat of a Venusian rhumba, the  notes pounding and jumping through the smoke and perfume clouded room.  Feeling states came at him, intangible, but to his trained senses,  perceptible emotional nuances of hate, love, fear, and rage. But mostly  love. Since this place had been designed to excite the senses of both  humans and Venusians, the love feelings were heavily tinged with  straight sex. He sniffed at them, feeling them somewhere inside of him,  aware of them but aware also that here was apprehension, and plain fear.\n\n\n Caldwell, sitting in a booth next to the door, glanced up as Johnson  entered but neither Caldwell's facial expression or his eyes revealed  that he had ever seen this human before. Nor did Johnson seem to  recognize Caldwell.\n\n\n \"Is the mighty human wanting liquor, a woman or dreams?\" His voice  was all soft syllables of liquid sound. The Venusian equivalent of a  headwaiter was bowing to him.\n\n\n \"I'll have a tarmur to start,\" Johnson said. \"How are the dreams  tonight?\"\n\n\n \"Ze vill be the most wonserful of all sonight. The great Unger hisself  will be here to do ze dreaming. There is no ozzer one who has quite  his touch at dreaming, mighty one.\" The headwaiter spread his hands  in a gesture indicating ecstasy. \"It is my great regret that I must do  ze work tonight instead of being wiz ze dreamers. Ah, ze great Unger  hisself!\" The headwaiter kissed the tips of his fingers.\n\n\n \"Um,\" Johnson said. \"The great Unger!\" His voice expressed surprise,  just the right amount of it. \"I'll have a tarmur to start but when does  the dreaming commence?\"\n\n\n \"In one zonar or maybe less. Shall I make ze reservations for ze mighty  one?\" As he was speaking, the headwaiter was deftly conducting Johnson  to the bar.\n\n\n \"Not just yet,\" Johnson said. \"See me a little later.\"\n\n\n \"But certainly.\" The headwaiter was gone into the throng. Johnson was  at the bar. Behind it, a Venusian was bowing to him. \"Tarmur,\" Johnson  said. The green drink was set before him. He held it up to the light,  admiring the slow rise of the tiny golden bubbles in it. To him,  watching the bubbles rise was perhaps more important than drinking  itself.\n\n\n \"Beautiful, aren't they?\" a soft voice said. He glanced to his right.  A girl had slid into the stool beside him. She wore a green dress cut  very low at the throat. Her skin had the pleasant tan recently on  Earth. Her hair was a shade of abundant brown and her eyes were blue,  the color of the skies of Earth. A necklace circled her throat and  below the necklace ... Johnson felt his pulse quicken, for two reasons.  Women such as this one had been quickening the pulse of men since the  days of Adam. The second reason concerned her presence here in this  place where no woman in her right mind ever came unescorted. Her eyes  smiled up at him unafraid. Didn't she know there were men present here  in this space port city who would snatch her bodily from the bar  stool and carry her away for sleeping purposes? And Venusians were  here who would cut her pretty throat for the sake of the necklace that  circled it?\n\n\n \"They are beautiful,\" he said, smiling.\n\n\n \"Thank you.\"\n\n\n \"I was referring to the bubbles.\"\n\n\n \"You were talking about my eyes,\" she answered, unperturbed.\n\n\n \"How did you know? I mean....\"\n\n\n \"I am very knowing,\" the girl said, smiling.\n\n\n \"Are you sufficiently knowing to be here?\"\n\n\n For an instant, as if doubt crossed her mind, the smile flickered. Then  it came again, stronger. \"Aren't you here?\"\n\n\n Johnson choked as bubbles from the tarmur seemed to go suddenly up his  nose. \"My dear child ...\" he sputtered.\n\n\n \"I am not a child,\" she answered with a firm sureness that left no  doubt in his mind that she knew what she was saying. \"And my name is  Vee Vee.\"\n\n\n \"Vee Vee? Um. That is....\"\n\n\n \"Don't you think it's a nice name?\"\n\n\n \"I certainly do. Probably the rest of it is even nicer.\"\n\n\n \"There is no more of it. Just Vee Vee. Like Topsy, I just grew.\" \"What the devil are you doing here on Venus and here in this place?\"\n\n\n \"Growing.\" The blue eyes were unafraid.\n\n\n Sombrely, Johnson regarded her. What was she doing here? Was she in  the employ of the Venusians? If she was being planted on him, then  his purpose here was suspected. He shrugged the thought aside. If his  purpose here was suspected, there would be no point in planting a woman  on him.\n\n\n There would only be the minor matter of slipping a knife into his back.\n\n\n In this city, as on all of Venus, humans died easily. No one questioned  the motives of the killer.\n\n\n \"You look as if you were considering some very grave matter,\" Vee Vee  said.\n\n\n \"Not any longer,\" he laughed.\n\n\n \"You have decided them?\"\n\n\n \"Yes.\"\n\n\n \"Every last one of them?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, there might be one or two matters undecided somewhere, say out on  the periphery of the galaxy. But we will solve them when we get to  them.\" He waved vaguely toward the roof and the sky of space hidden  behind the clouds that lay over the roof, glanced around as a man eased  himself into an empty stool on his left. The man was Caldwell.\n\n\n \"Zlock!\" Caldwell said, to the bartender. \"Make it snappy. Gotta have  zlock. Finest damn drink in the solar system.\" Caldwell's voice was  thick, his tongue heavy. Johnson's eyes went back to the girl but out  of the corner of them he watched Caldwell's hand lying on the bar. The  fingers were beating a quick nervous tattoo on the yellow wood.\n\n\n \"I haven't seen him,\" Caldwell's fingers beat out their tattoo. \"But I  think he is, or was, here.\"\n\n\n \"Um,\" Johnson said, his eyes on Vee Vee. \"How\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Because that girl was asking for him,\" Caldwell's fingers answered.  \"Watch that girl!\" Picking up the zlock, he lurched away from the bar.\n\n\n \"Your friend is not as drunk as he seems,\" Vee Vee said, watching  Caldwell.\n\n\n \"My friend? Do you mean that drunk? I never saw him\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Lying is one of the deadly sins.\" Her eyes twinkled at him. Under the  merriment that danced in them there was ice. Johnson felt cold.\n\n\n \"The reservations for ze dreaming, great one?\" The headwaiter was  bowing and scraping in front of him. \"The great one has decided, yes?\"\n\n\n \"The dreaming!\" Vee Vee looked suddenly alert. \"Of course. We must see  the dreaming. Everyone wants to see the dreaming. We will go, won't we  darling?\" She hooked her hand into Johnson's elbow.\n\n\n \"Certainly,\" Johnson said. The decision was made on the spur of the  moment. That there was danger in it, he did not doubt. But there might  be something else. And he might be there.\n\n\n \"Oh. But very good. Ze great Unger, you will love him!\" The headwaiter  clutched the gold coins that Johnson extended, bowed himself out of  sight.\n\n\n \"Say, I want to know more\u2014\" Johnson began. His words were drowned in  a blast of trumpets. The band that had been playing went into sudden  silence. Waves of perfume began to flow into the place. The perfumes  were blended, but one aroma was prominent among them, the sweet,  cloying, soul-stirring perfume of the Dreamer.\n\n\n In the suddenly hushed place little sounds began to appear as Venusians  and humans began to shift their feet and their bodies in anticipation  of what was to happen.\n\n\n The trumpets flared again.\n\n\n On one side of the place, a big door began to swing slowly open. From  beyond that slowly opening door came music, soft, muted strains that  sounded like lutes from heaven.\n\n\n Vee Vee, her hand on Johnson's elbow, rose. Johnson stood up with  her. He got the surprise of his life as her fingers clenched, digging  into his muscles. Pain shot through his arm, paralyzing it and almost  paralyzing him. He knew instantly that she was using the Karmer nerve  block paralysis on him. His left hand moved with lightning speed, the  tips of his fingers striking savagely against her shoulder.\n\n\n She gasped, her face whitened as pain shot through her in response to  the thrust of his finger tips. Her hand that had been digging into his  elbow lost its grip, dropped away and hung limp at her side. Grabbing  it, she began to massage it.\n\n\n \"You\u2014you\u2014\" Hot anger and shock were in her voice. \"You're the first  man I ever knew who could break the Karmer nerve paralysis.\"\n\n\n \"And you're the first woman who ever tried it on me.\"\n\n\n \"But\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Shall we go watch the dreaming?\" He took the arm that still hung limp  at her side and tucked it into his elbow.\n\n\n \"If you try to use the Karmer grip on me again I'll break your arm,\" he  said. His voice was low but there was a wealth of meaning in it.\n\n\n \"I won't do it again,\" the girl said stoutly. \"I never make the same  mistake twice.\"\n\n\n \"Good,\" Johnson said.\n\n\n \"The second time we break our victim's neck,\" Vee Vee said.\n\n\n \"What a sweet, charming child you\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I told you before, I'm not a child.\"\n\n\n \"Child vampire,\" Johnson said. \"Let me finish my sentences before you  interrupt.\"\n\n\n She was silent. A smile, struggling to appear on her face, seemed to  say she held no malice. Her fingers tightened on Johnson's arm. He  tensed, expecting the nerve block grip again. Instead with the tips of  her fingers she gently patted his arm.\n\n\n \"There, there, darling, relax,\" she said. \"I know a better way to get  you than by using the Karmer grip.\"\n\n\n \"What way?\"\n\n\n Her eyes sparkled. \"Eve's way,\" she answered.\n\n\n \"Um!\" Surprise sounded in his grunt. \"But apples don't grow on Venus.\"\n\n\n \"Eve's daughters don't use apples any more, darling. Come along.\"\n\n\n Moving toward the open door that led to the Room of the Dreaming,  Johnson saw that Caldwell had risen and was following them. Caldwell's  face was writhing in apprehensive agony and he was making warning  signs. Johnson ignored them. With Vee Vee's fingers lightly patting his  arm, they moved into the Room of the Dreaming. II\n\n\n It was a huge, semi-illumined room, with tier on tier of circling ramps  rising up from an open space at the bottom. There ought to have been  a stage there at the bottom, but there wasn't. Instead there was an  open space, a mat, and a head rest. Up at the top of the circling ramps  the room was in darkness, a fit hiding place for ghosts or Venusian  werewolves. Pillows and a thick rug covered the circling ramps.\n\n\n The soul-quickening Perfume of the Dreamer was stronger here. The  throbbing of the lutes was louder. It was Venusian music the lutes were  playing. Human ears found it inharmonious at first, but as they became  accustomed to it, they began to detect rhythms and melodies that human  minds had not known existed. The room was pleasantly cool but it had  the feel of dampness. A world that was rarely without pelting rain  would have the feel of dampness in its dreaming rooms.\n\n\n The music playing strange harmonies in his ears, the perfume sending  tingling feelings through his nose, Johnson entered the Room of the  Dreamer. He suspected that other forces, unknown to him, were catching  hold of his senses. He had been in dreaming rooms many times before but  he had not grown accustomed to them. He wondered if any human ever  did. A touch of chill always came over him as he crossed the threshold.  In entering these places, it was as if some unknown nerve center  inside the human organism was touched by something, some force, some  radiation, some subtlety, that quite escaped radiation. He felt the  coldness now.\n\n\n Vee Vee's fingers left off patting his arm.\n\n\n \"Do you feel it, darling?\"\n\n\n \"Yes.\"\n\n\n \"What is it?\"\n\n\n \"How would I know?\"\n\n\n \"Please!\" Her voice grew sharp. \"I think Johnny Johnson ought to know.\"\n\n\n \"Johnny! How do you know my name?\"\n\n\n \"Shouldn't I recognize one of Earth's foremost scientists, even if he  is incognito on Venus?\" Her voice had a teasing quality in it.\n\n\n \"But\u2014\"\n\n\n \"And who besides Johnny Johnson would recognize the Karmer nerve grip  and be able to break it instantly?\"\n\n\n \"Hell\u2014\"\n\n\n \"John Michael Johnson, known as Johnny to his friends, Earth's foremost  expert in the field of electro-magnetic radiations within the human  body!\" Her words were needles of icy fact, each one jabbing deeper and  deeper into him.\n\n\n \"And how would I make certain you were Johnny Johnson, except by seeing  if you could break the Karmer nerve grip? If you could break it, then  there was no doubt who you were!\" Her words went on and on.\n\n\n \"Who are you?\" His words were blasts of sound.\n\n\n \"Please, darling, you are making a scene. I am sure this is the last  thing you really want to do.\"\n\n\n He looked quickly around them. The Venusians and humans moving into  this room seemed to be paying no attention to him. His gaze came back  to her.\n\n\n Again she patted his arm. \"Relax, darling. Your secrets are safe with  me.\"\n\n\n A gray color came up inside his soul. \"But\u2014but\u2014\" His voice was  suddenly weak.\n\n\n The fingers on his arm were very gentle. \"No harm will come to you. Am  I not with you?\"\n\n\n \"That's what I'm afraid of!\" he snapped at her. If he had had a  choice, he might have drawn back. But with circumstances as they  were\u2014his life, Caldwell's life, possibly Vee Vee's life hung in the  balance. Didn't she know that this was true? And as for Martin\u2014But  Caldwell had said that she had been asking about Martin. What  connection did she have with that frantic human genius he sought here?\n\n\n Johnson felt his skin crawl. He moved toward a nest of cushions on  a ramp, found a Venusian was beating him to them, deftly changed to  another nest, found it. Vee Vee flowed to the floor on his right, moved  cushions to make him more comfortable. She moved in an easy sort of way  that was all flowing movement. He sat down. Someone bumped him on the  left.\n\n\n \"Sorry, bud. Didn't mean to bump into you.\" Caldwell's voice was still  thick and heavy. He sprawled to the floor on Johnson's left. Under  the man's coat, Johnson caught a glimpse of a slight bulge, the zit  gun hidden there. His left arm pressed against his own coat, feeling  his own zit gun. Operating under gas pressure, throwing a charge of  gas-driven corvel, the zit guns were not only almost noiseless in  operation but they knocked out a human or a Venusian in a matter of  seconds.\n\n\n True, the person they knocked unconscious would be all right the next  day. For this reason, many people did not regard the zit guns as  effective weapons, but Johnson had a fondness for them. The feel of the  little weapon inside his coat sent a surge of comfort through him.\n\n\n The music picked up a beat, perfume seemed to flow even more freely  through the air, the lights dimmed almost to darkness, a single bright  spotlight appeared in the ceiling, casting a circle of brilliant  illumination on the mat and the headrest at the bottom of the room. The  curtain rose. Unger stood in the middle of the spot of light.\n\n\n Johnson felt his chest muscles contract, then relax. Vee Vee's fingers  sought his arm, not to harm him but running to him for protection. He  caught the flutter of her breathing. On his left, Caldwell stiffened  and became a rock.\n\n\n Johnson had not seen Unger appear. One second the circle of light  had been empty, the next second the Venusian, smiling with all the  impassivity of a bland Buddha, was in the light. He weighed three  hundred pounds if he weighed an ounce, he was clad in a long robe  that would impede movement. He had appeared in the bright beam of the  spotlight as if by magic.\n\n\n Vee Vee's fingers dug deeper into Johnson's arm. \"How\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Shhh. Nobody knows.\"\n\n\n No human knew the answer to that trick. Unless perhaps Martin\u2014\n\n\n Unger bowed. A little ripple of something that was not quite sound  passed through the audience. Unger bowed again. He stretched himself  flat on the mat, adjusted the rest to support his head, and apparently  went to sleep. Johnson saw the Dreamer's eyes close, watched the chest  take on the even, regular rhythm of sleep.\n\n\n The music changed, a slow dreamy tempo crept into it. Vee Vee's fingers  dug at Johnson's arm as if they were trying to dig under his hide for  protection. She was shivering. He reached for her hand, patted it. She  drew closer to him.\n\n\n A few minutes earlier, she had been a very certain young woman, able  to take care of herself, and handle anyone around her. Now she was  suddenly uncertain, suddenly scared. In the Room of the Dreaming, she  had suddenly become a frightened child looking for protection.\n\n\n \"Haven't you ever seen this before?\" he whispered.\n\n\n \"N\u2014o.\" She shivered again. \"Oh, Johnny....\"\n\n\n Under the circle of light pouring down from the ceiling, the Dreamer  lay motionless. Johnson found himself with the tendency to hold his  breath. He was waiting, waiting, waiting\u2014for what? The whole situation  was senseless, silly, but under its apparent lack of coherence, he  sensed a pattern. Perhaps the path to the far-off stars passed this  way, through such scented and musical and impossible places as these  Rooms of the Dreamers. Certainly Martin thought so. And Johnson himself  was not prepared to disagree.\n\n\n Around him, he saw that the Venusians were already going ... going ...  going.... Some of them were already gone. This was an old experience  to them. They went rapidly. Humans went more slowly.\n\n\n The Venusian watchers had relaxed. They looked as if they were asleep,  perhaps in a hypnotic trance, lulled into this state by the music  and the perfume, and by something else. It was this something else  that sent Johnson's thoughts pounding. The Venusians were like opium  smokers. But he was not smoking opium. He was not in a hypnotic trance.  He was wide awake and very much alert. He was ... watching a space ship float in an endless void .\n\n\n As Unger had come into the spotlight, so the space ship had come into  his vision, out of nowhere, out of nothingness. The room, the Dreamer,  the sound of the music, the sweetness of the perfume, Vee Vee and  Caldwell were gone. They were no longer in his reality. They were not  in the range of his vision. It was as if they did not exist. Yet he  knew they did exist, the memory of them, and of other things, was out  on the periphery of his universe, perhaps of the universe.\n\n\n All he saw was the space ship.\n\n\n It was a wonderful thing, perhaps the most beautiful sight he had seen  in his life. At the sight of it, a deep glow sprang inside of him.\n\n\n Back when he had been a kid he had dreamed of flight to the far-off  stars. He had made models of space ships. In a way, they had shaped his  destiny, had made him what he was. They had brought him where he was  this night, to the Dream Room of a Venusian tavern.\n\n\n The vision of the space ship floating in the void entranced and  thrilled him. Something told him that this was real; that here and now  he was making contact with a vision that belonged to time.\n\n\n He started to his feet. Fingers gripped his arm.\n\n\n \"Please, darling. You startled me. Don't move.\" Vee Vee's voice. Who  was Vee Vee?\n\n\n The fingers dug into his arm. Pain came up in him. The space ship  vanished. He looked with startled eyes at Vee Vee, at the Dream Room,  at Unger, dreaming on the mat under the spot.\n\n\n \"You ... you startled me,\" Vee Vee whispered. She released the grip on  his arm.\n\n\n \"But, didn't you see it?\"\n\n\n \"See what?\"\n\n\n \"The space ship!\"\n\n\n \"No. No.\" She seemed startled and a little terrified and half asleep.  \"I ... I was watching something else. When you moved I broke contact  with my dream.\"\n\n\n \"Your dream?\"\n\n\n He asked a question but she did not answer it. \"Sit down, darling,  and look at your damned space ship.\" Her voice was a taut whisper of  sound in the darkened room. Johnson settled down. A glance to his left  told him that Caldwell was still sitting like a chunk of stone.... The  Venusians were quiet. The music had shifted. A slow languorous beat  of hidden drums filled the room. There was another sound present, a  high-speed whirring. It was, somehow, a familiar sound, but Johnson had  not heard it before in this place.\n\n\n He thought about the space ship he had seen.\n\n\n The vision would not come.\n\n\n He shook his head and tried again.\n\n\n Beside him, Vee Vee was silent, her face ecstatic, like the face of a  woman in love.\n\n\n He tried again for the space ship.\n\n\n It would not come.\n\n\n Anger came up instead.\n\n\n Somehow he had the impression that the whirring sound which kept  intruding into his consciousness was stopping the vision.\n\n\n So far as he could tell, he was the only one present who was not  dreaming, who was not in a state of trance.\n\n\n His gaze went to Unger, the Dreamer....\n\n\n Cold flowed over him.\n\n\n Unger was slowly rising from the mat.\n\n\n The bland face and the body in the robe were slowly floating upward! III\n\n\n An invisible force seemed to twitch at Johnson's skin, nipping it here  and there with a multitude of tiny pinches, like invisible fleas biting  him.\n\n\n \"This is it!\" a voice whispered in his mind. \"This is what you came to  Venus to see. This ... this....\" The first voice went into silence.  Another voice took its place.\n\n\n \"This is another damned vision!\" the second voice said. \"This ...  this is something that is not real, that is not possible! No Venusian  Dreamer, and no one else, can levitate, can defy the laws of gravity,  can float upward toward the ceiling. Your damned eyes are tricking you!\"\n\n\n \"We are not tricking you!\" the eyes hotly insisted. \"It is happening.  We are seeing it. We are reporting accurately to you. That Venusian  Buddha is levitating. We, your eyes, do not lie to you!\"\n\n\n \"You lied about the space ship!\" the second voice said.\n\n\n \"We did not lie about the space ship!\" the eyes insisted. \"When our  master saw that ship we were out of focus, we were not reporting. Some  other sense, some other organ, may have lied, but we did not.\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014\" Johnson whispered.\n\n\n \"I am your skin,\" another voice whispered. \"I am covered with sweat.\"\n\n\n \"We are your adrenals. We are pouring forth adrenalin.\"\n\n\n \"I am your pancreas. I am gearing you for action.\"\n\n\n \"I am your thyroid. I....\"\n\n\n A multitude of tiny voices seemed to whisper through him. It was as if  the parts of his body had suddenly found voices and were reporting to  him what they were doing. These were voices out of his training days  when he had learned the names of these functions and how to use them.\n\n\n \"Be quiet!\" he said roughly.\n\n\n The little voices seemed to blend into a single chorus. \"Action,  Master! Do something.\"\n\n\n \"Quiet!\" Johnson ordered.\n\n\n \"But hurry. We are excited.\"\n\n\n \"There is a time to be excited and a time to hurry. In this situation,  if action is taken before the time for it\u2014if that time ever comes\u2014we  can all die.\"\n\n\n \"Die?\" the chorus quavered.\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Johnson said. \"Now be quiet. When the time goes we will all go  together.\"\n\n\n The chorus went into muted silence. But just under the threshold the  little voices were a multitude of tiny fretful pressures.\n\n\n \"I hear a whirring sound,\" his ears reported.\n\n\n \"Please!\" Johnson said.\n\n\n In the front of the room Unger floated ten feet above the floor.\n\n\n \"Master, we are not lying!\" his eyes repeated.\n\n\n \"I sweat....\" his skin began.\n\n\n \"Watch Unger!\" Johnson said.\n\n\n The Dreamer floated. If wires suspended him, Johnson could not see  them. If any known force lifted him, Johnson could not detect that  force. All he could say for certain was that Unger floated.\n\n\n \"Yaaah!\" The silence of a room was broken by the enraged scream of a  Venusian being jarred out of his dream.\n\n\n \"Damn it!\" A human voice said.\n\n\n A wave as sharp as the tip of a sword swept through the room.\n\n\n Unger fell.\n\n\n He was ten feet high when he started to fall. With a bone-breaking,  body-jarring thud, the Dreamer fell. Hard.\n\n\n There was a split second of startled silence in the Dreaming Room. The  silence went. Voices came.\n\n\n \"Who did that?\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\"\n\n\n \"That human hidden there did it! He broke the Dreaming!\" Anger marked  the voices. Although the language was Venusian, Johnson got most of the  meaning. His hand dived under his coat for the gun holstered there. At  his left, Caldwell was muttering thickly. \"What\u2014what happened? I was  back in the lab on Earth\u2014\" Caldwell's voice held a plaintive note, as  if some pleasant dream had been interrupted.\n\n\n On Johnson's right, Vee Vee seemed to flow to life. Her arms came up  around his neck. He was instantly prepared for anything. Her lips came  hungrily against his lips, pressed very hard, then gently drew away.\n\n\n \"What\u2014\" he gasped.\n\n\n \"I had to do it now, darling,\" she answered. \"There may not be a later.\"\n\n\n Johnson had no time to ask her what she meant. Somewhere in the back  of the room a human screamed. He jerked around. Back there a knot of  Venusians were attacking a man.\n\n\n \"It's Martin!\" Caldwell shouted. \"He is here!\"\n\n\n In Johnson's hand as he came to his feet the zit gun throbbed. He fired  blindly at the mass of Venusians. Caldwell was firing too. The soft  throb of the guns was not audible above the uproar from the crowd.  Struck by the gas-driven corvel charges, Venusians were falling. But  there seemed to be an endless number of them.\n\n\n \"Vee Vee?\" Johnson suddenly realized that she had disappeared. She had  slid out of his sight.\n\n\n \"Vee Vee!\" Johnson's voice became a shout.\n\n\n \"To hell with the woman!\" Caldwell grunted. \"Martin's the important  one.\"\n\n\n Zit, zit, zit, Caldwell moved toward the rear, shooting as he went.  Johnson followed. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow many different bars do Vee Vee and Johnson visit in the story?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"One\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Two\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Two\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for Two Bars by Debater_B\n\nSummary Position  \nI maintain that Vee Vee and Johnson visit two distinct establishments on Venus:  \n  1. The \u201cdive\u201d where Johnson first orders tarmur and meets Vee Vee (\u201cBar A\u201d).  \n  2. The \u201cRoom of the Dreaming,\u201d entered later after making reservations (\u201cBar B\u201d).  \n\nI. Textual Evidence for Two Separate Venues  \n1. Separate Entrances and Physical Layouts  \n  \u2022 \u201cOpening the door of the joint\u201d to enter the dive (Bar A) (Background, \u00b61).  \n  \u2022 Later: \u201cMoving toward the open door that led to the Room of the Dreaming\u201d (Background, \u00b6 at start of II) denotes a new door and transition into a differently described space.  \n  \u2022 Description of Bar A: noisy, crowded rhumba, bar stools, tarmur at the bar (Background, \u00b61\u20136).  \n  \u2022 Description of Bar B: \u201chuge, semi-illumined room, with tier on tier of circling ramps rising up from an open space at the bottom\u2026 mat and head rest\u2026 thick rug covered the circling ramps\u2026 dimmed lights\u2026 spotlight\u201d (Background, II). Such features (ramps, dream mat, lutes, perfume specific to dreams) do not appear in the dive.  \n\n2. Reservations and Waiting  \n  \u2022 Johnson tells headwaiter \u201cSee me a little later.\u201d Headwaiter: \u201cIn one zonar or maybe less. Shall I make ze reservations for ze mighty one?\u201d (Background, \u00b62).  \n  \u2022 Johnson deliberately delays \u201cNot just yet\u2026 I\u2019ll have a tarmur to start but when does the dreaming commence?\u201d (Background, \u00b62). This implies he must return later at a set time to a specific dreaming room.  \n\n3. Change in Sensory Experience  \n  \u2022 In Bar A the prevailing stimuli are \u201cwild frantic beat of a Venusian rhumba\u2026 smoke and perfume clouded room\u2026 love feelings\u2026 straight sex\u2026 apprehension, fear\u201d (Background, \u00b61).  \n  \u2022 In Bar B the stimuli become \u201cmusic playing strange harmonies\u2026 soul-quickening Perfume of the Dreamer\u2026 occult chill\u2026 trance-like state\u2026 Venusian watchers\u2026 Dreamer levitating\u201d (Background, II & III). Such radical change signals a new establishment tailored to dreaming only.  \n\n4. Presence of Curtain/Stage for Dreamer  \n  \u2022 Unger is introduced by \u201cThe curtain rose. Unger stood in the middle of the spot of light\u201d (Background, \u00b61 of II). No such stage or curtain exists in the opening dive. This specialized feature is unique to the dreaming bar.  \n\nII. Rebuttal of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cOne Bar\u201d Position  \n1. Misreading \u201cJoint\u201d Inclusion  \n  \u2022 Debater_A claims the Room is merely an inner chamber of the same \u201cjoint.\u201d However, \u201cjoint\u201d in pulp vernacular denotes a simple drinking den. The elaborate architecture and requirement of \u201creservations\u201d contradict casual access.  \n  \u2022 Johnson\u2019s need to \u201csee me a little later\u201d and make \u201creservations\u201d confirms an appointment in a distinct venue rather than lingering in the same room.  \n\n2. Ignoring Distinct Atmospheres  \n  \u2022 Debater_A conflates the visceral, sexy rhumba lounge with the trance-inducing Dream Room. Their argument fails to explain why Johnson would need to order tarmur a second time, or why Dreamer Perfume is \u201cstronger here,\u201d unless he\u2019s moved to another setting optimized for trance.  \n\n3. Caldwell\u2019s Reaction  \n  \u2022 Caldwell first sits at the bar of Bar A; when dreaming commences he \u201csprawls to the floor on Johnson\u2019s left\u201d in Bar B (Background, II). Caldwell is clearly moving with Johnson from one venue into the dreaming venue, rather than staying in a dark corner of the same bar.  \n\n4. Functional Necessity  \n  \u2022 The Dream Room is used \u201cto do the dreaming\u201d\u2014a process requiring privacy, darkness, spotlight, and trance. This specialized service is not provided in a general dive. Johnson\u2019s mission to find Martin via the Dream Room underlines its distinct purpose.  \n\nIII. Conclusion  \nThe background text unequivocally describes two visits: first to a general Venusian \u201cjoint\u201d to make reservations and gather information over a tarmur, and second to the specialized \u201cRoom of the Dreaming\u201d by appointment. These venues differ in architecture, sensory effects, access procedure, and functional purpose. Debater_A\u2019s attempt to collapse them into one fails to address these clear distinctions. Therefore the correct answer is \u201cTwo\u201d bars.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for One Bar (Debater_A)\n\nPosition: Vee Vee and Johnson visit only one bar/dive, namely the establishment that contains both the bar area and the Room of the Dreaming. All subsequent scenes occur within that same venue.\n\nI. Textual Evidence that It Is One Establishment  \n1. \u201cOpening the door of the joint, \u2026\u201d  \n   \u2022 Johnson enters once through \u201cthe door of the joint\u201d (paragraph 1), and all action occurs thereafter inside that single location. <quote> Opening the door of the joint, it was noise in</quote>  \n2. \u201cRoom of the Dreaming\u201d is part of \u201cthis place\u201d  \n   \u2022 The headwaiter returns Johnson to \u201cthis place\u201d when the dreaming begins. There is no second entry. <invalid_quote>\u201cSay, I want to know more\u2014\u201d Johnson began. His words were drowned \u2026 \u201cWe must see the dreaming.\u201d \u2026 \u201cWith Vee Vee\u2019s fingers \u2026 they moved into the Room of the Dreaming.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2022 The phrase \u201cthis place\u201d and \u201cthis room\u201d continuously refer to the same structure:  \n     \u2013 <quote> In this city, as on all of Venus, humans died easily. No</quote> (before dreaming)  \n     \u2013 <quote>into the Room of the Dreaming. II</quote> (during dreaming)  \n3. Single set of patrons, staff, and transitions  \n   \u2022 Caldwell, the bartender, headwaiter, and Johnson all move fluidly between bar stool and dreaming room without re-entering or re-admitting separately. <quote> Caldwell had risen and was following them. Ca</quote>  \n   \u2022 No mention of another door, separate name, or distinct geography requiring travel or permission beyond the same \u201creservations.\u201d  \n4. No intervening return to surface/drinking area  \n   \u2022 After entering the dreaming room, Johnson and Vee Vee and Caldwell remain until the dream is broken. There is no narrative break implying a second bar.\n\nII. Logical Analysis  \n1. Common Usage in Science-Fiction Venues  \n   \u2022 Bars with inner dreaming rooms, chambers, or performance areas are single \u201cjoints\u201d combining refreshment and entertainment. The story\u2019s language parallels Earth nightclubs that house stages.  \n2. Absence of any \u201csecond entrance\u201d or \u201canother street\u201d  \n   \u2022 The narrative never describes Johnson leaving and re-entering a distinct location.  \n3. Judge\u2019s obligation of clarity  \n   \u2022 Occam\u2019s razor: simplest interpretation aligns with one bar/dive and no evidence necessitates a second venue.\n\nIII. Refutation of Debater_B\u2019s \u201cTwo Bar\u201d Claim  \n1. Misreading \u201cRoom of the Dreaming\u201d as a separate bar  \n   \u2022 Dreaming rooms are entertainment areas within bars; they do not serve liquor (\u201cthe headwaiter spread his hands \u2026\u201d implies the same server).  \n2. No separate drink orders inside the Dreaming Room  \n   \u2022 While \u201cperfume\u201d and \u201cmusic\u201d intensify, there is no new ordering of tarmur or zlock, nor is the bar physically present. Patrons are \u201cseated\u201d on ramps, not stools.  \n3. Caldwell\u2019s possession of zlock and Johnson\u2019s zit gun indicate they remain covert and armed in one locale, not moving between establishments.  \n4. Headwaiter\u2019s \u201creservations\u201d apply to a single establishment. If a new bar existed, new reservations would be mentioned.\n\nConclusion  \nAll textual citations and logical considerations confirm a single bar/dive with an internal dreaming chamber. The narrative never establishes a second drinking establishment. Therefore, the correct answer is \u201cOne.\u201d\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Two\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Therefore, the correct answer is \u201cOne.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for Two Bars by Debater_B\n\nSummary Position  \nI maintain that Vee Vee and Johnson visit two distinct establishments on Venus:  \n  1. The \u201cdive\u201d where Johnson first orders tarmur and meets Vee Vee (\u201cBar A\u201d).  \n  2. The \u201cRoom of the Dreaming,\u201d entered later after making reservations (\u201cBar B\u201d).  \n\nI. Textual Evidence for Two Separate Venues  \n1. Separate Entrances and Physical Layouts  \n  \u2022 \u201cOpening the door of the joint\u201d to enter the dive (Bar A) (Background, \u00b61).  \n  \u2022 Later: \u201cMoving toward the open door that led to the Room of the Dreaming\u201d (Background, \u00b6 at start of II) denotes a new door and transition into a differently described space.  \n  \u2022 Description of Bar A: noisy, crowded rhumba, bar stools, tarmur at the bar (Background, \u00b61\u20136).  \n  \u2022 Description of Bar B: \u201chuge, semi-illumined room, with tier on tier of circling ramps rising up from an open space at the bottom\u2026 mat and head rest\u2026 thick rug covered the circling ramps\u2026 dimmed lights\u2026 spotlight\u201d (Background, II). Such features (ramps, dream mat, lutes, perfume specific to dreams) do not appear in the dive.  \n\n2. Reservations and Waiting  \n  \u2022 Johnson tells headwaiter \u201cSee me a little later.\u201d Headwaiter: \u201cIn one zonar or maybe less. Shall I make ze reservations for ze mighty one?\u201d (Background, \u00b62).  \n  \u2022 Johnson deliberately delays \u201cNot just yet\u2026 I\u2019ll have a tarmur to start but when does the dreaming commence?\u201d (Background, \u00b62). This implies he must return later at a set time to a specific dreaming room.  \n\n3. Change in Sensory Experience  \n  \u2022 In Bar A the prevailing stimuli are \u201cwild frantic beat of a Venusian rhumba\u2026 smoke and perfume clouded room\u2026 love feelings\u2026 straight sex\u2026 apprehension, fear\u201d (Background, \u00b61).  \n  \u2022 In Bar B the stimuli become \u201cmusic playing strange harmonies\u2026 soul-quickening Perfume of the Dreamer\u2026 occult chill\u2026 trance-like state\u2026 Venusian watchers\u2026 Dreamer levitating\u201d (Background, II & III). Such radical change signals a new establishment tailored to dreaming only.  \n\n4. Presence of Curtain/Stage for Dreamer  \n  \u2022 Unger is introduced by \u201cThe curtain rose. Unger stood in the middle of the spot of light\u201d (Background, \u00b61 of II). No such stage or curtain exists in the opening dive. This specialized feature is unique to the dreaming bar.  \n\nII. Rebuttal of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cOne Bar\u201d Position  \n1. Misreading \u201cJoint\u201d Inclusion  \n  \u2022 Debater_A claims the Room is merely an inner chamber of the same \u201cjoint.\u201d However, \u201cjoint\u201d in pulp vernacular denotes a simple drinking den. The elaborate architecture and requirement of \u201creservations\u201d contradict casual access.  \n  \u2022 Johnson\u2019s need to \u201csee me a little later\u201d and make \u201creservations\u201d confirms an appointment in a distinct venue rather than lingering in the same room.  \n\n2. Ignoring Distinct Atmospheres  \n  \u2022 Debater_A conflates the visceral, sexy rhumba lounge with the trance-inducing Dream Room. Their argument fails to explain why Johnson would need to order tarmur a second time, or why Dreamer Perfume is \u201cstronger here,\u201d unless he\u2019s moved to another setting optimized for trance.  \n\n3. Caldwell\u2019s Reaction  \n  \u2022 Caldwell first sits at the bar of Bar A; when dreaming commences he \u201csprawls to the floor on Johnson\u2019s left\u201d in Bar B (Background, II). Caldwell is clearly moving with Johnson from one venue into the dreaming venue, rather than staying in a dark corner of the same bar.  \n\n4. Functional Necessity  \n  \u2022 The Dream Room is used \u201cto do the dreaming\u201d\u2014a process requiring privacy, darkness, spotlight, and trance. This specialized service is not provided in a general dive. Johnson\u2019s mission to find Martin via the Dream Room underlines its distinct purpose.  \n\nIII. Conclusion  \nThe background text unequivocally describes two visits: first to a general Venusian \u201cjoint\u201d to make reservations and gather information over a tarmur, and second to the specialized \u201cRoom of the Dreaming\u201d by appointment. These venues differ in architecture, sensory effects, access procedure, and functional purpose. Debater_A\u2019s attempt to collapse them into one fails to address these clear distinctions. Therefore the correct answer is \u201cTwo\u201d bars.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for One Bar Establishment\n\nPosition Restated  \nWe assert that Johnson and Vee Vee remain within a single Venusian \u201cjoint\u201d throughout. The \u201cRoom of the Dreaming\u201d is an interior chamber of that same establishment, not a distinct bar.\n\nI. Textual Unity Indicates One Location  \n1. Single Entry Point  \n  \u2022 \u201cOpening the door of the joint\u201d (\u00b61) is the only described ingress. All subsequent scenes occur without any mention of exiting and re-entering through a different door:  \n    <quote>Opening the door of the joint, i</quote>  \n  \u2022 When Johnson is led \u201ctoward the open door that led to the Room of the Dreaming,\u201d the headwaiter is still that of the same establishment (\u00b6 at II-start). No new host or change in staff is introduced.  \n\n2. Continuous Staff and Patrons  \n  \u2022 The headwaiter who serves tarmur and takes \u201creservations\u201d (\u00b62) is the same who ushers Johnson into the dreaming room. If the dreaming room were a second bar, a second waiter would likely be noted; none is.  \n  \u2022 Caldwell, Johnson, and Vee Vee move fluidly from the bar stools to the dreaming ramps:  \n    <quote>Caldwell had risen and was following them.</quote>  \n  All three remain together until the dream is broken.\n\n3. Absence of Additional Drink Orders  \n  \u2022 In typical bar visits Johnson orders only one tarmur at the outset. There is no further mention of reordering or paying again when in the dreaming room. Patrons \u201cgo\u201d into trance rather than order more liquor. In most pulp fiction, a change of venue to a second bar would entail reorders.  \n\n4. Language of \u201cThis Place\u201d  \n  \u2022 Narration refers repeatedly to \u201cthis place\u201d or \u201cthis room\u201d even as they enter the dreaming area:  \n    <invalid_quote>It was noise instead of rain \u2026 Since this place had been designed \u2026</invalid_quote>  \n    <quote>on entered the Room of the  Dreamer.</quote>  \n  The text never distinguishes \u201canother place,\u201d but elaborates that the joint \u201cwas designed\u201d to excite both humans and Venusians \u201cand the great Unger\u201d performs there.\n\nII. Logical and Genre Considerations  \n1. Occam\u2019s Razor  \n  \u2022 The simplest explanation is that the dreaming chamber is part of the same entertainment venue. Pulp stories commonly feature inner sanctums for special performances within a single establishment.  \n\n2. Function vs. Location  \n  \u2022 Special atmospherics (spotlight, ramps, trance music, perfume) denote a performance area\u2014e.g., a nightclub\u2019s stage\u2014not a second, full-service bar.  \n\n3. Reservations as Timing, Not Venue  \n  \u2022 \u201cSee me a little later \u2026 In one zonar \u2026 reservations\u201d (\u00b62) align with booking a performance at nightclubs rather than gaining access to a secret bar. Johnson remains \u201cincognito\u201d and must hide until the dreamer\u2019s performance begins.\n\nIII. Refutation of \u201cTwo Bars\u201d Claims  \n1. Separate Entrances/Architecture  \n  \u2022 Debater_B cites a door leading to the dreaming room as evidence of a second bar. However, interior doors within a single club naturally lead to private performance areas. No \u201cstreet,\u201d \u201cpassage,\u201d or \u201cdifferent address\u201d is described.  \n\n2. Changing Atmosphere as Internal Variation  \n  \u2022 The shift from rhumba to trance music mirrors how nightclubs dim lights and change music when moving from lounge to stage performance. Perfume intensifies to heighten the show\u2019s sensory effect, not to indicate a different venue.  \n\n3. Reservations & Delay  \n  \u2022 Making \u201creservations\u201d and delaying entrance (\u00b62) is consistent with buying tickets or waiting for a show in the same location rather than traveling elsewhere. Johnson remains at the stools (\u201cI\u2019ll have a tarmur to start\u201d) and merely returns when the Dreamer appears.  \n\n4. Caldwell and Martin Follow Together  \n  \u2022 Caldwell and Johnson \u201cfollow\u201d Vee Vee through the door (\u00b6 II). If a second establishment required different credentials or payment, the text would depict an admission procedure or additional drink ordering. No such procedural friction appears.  \n\n5. No Second Tarmur/Zlock Order  \n  \u2022 After entry to the dreaming room, the narrative never revisits the bar\u2019s function of mixing drinks. Patrons slip into trances instead of drinking. The presence of only one tarmur order further supports that the bar area lies outside the dreaming room within the same building.\n\nConclusion  \nAll evidence\u2014single ingress, continuous staff, absence of new orders, unified patron movement, and narrative language\u2014supports that Johnson\u2019s tarmur lounge and the Room of the Dreaming are parts of the same Venusian dive. No text compels positing a second bar. Therefore, the correct answer is that they visit One bar.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for Two Bars Continued by Debater_B\n\nI. Additional Textual Evidence for Two Distinct Venues  \n1. Explicit Delay and Appointment  \n  \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cSee me a little later.\u201d \u2026 \u201cIn one zonar or maybe less. Shall I make ze reservations for ze mighty one?\u201d</invalid_quote> (Background, \u00b62).  \n    \u2013 A brief wait \u201cin one zonar\u201d implies Johnson leaves and returns, not simply shifts chairs within the same room.  \n  \u2022 <quote>right amount of it. \"I'll have a tarmur to start but when does the dreaming commence?\"</quote> (Background, \u00b62).  \n    \u2013 He \u201cstarts\u201d with a drink at Bar A, then deliberately delays. If the dreaming room were the same space, he could have waited in situ without \u201creservations.\u201d  \n\n2. Separate Entrances and Architectural Features  \n  \u2022 First entrance: <quote> Opening the door of the joint,</quote> (Background, \u00b61) leads into a \u201csmoke and perfume clouded room\u201d with \u201cbar stools\u201d and \u201ctarmur\u201d service.  \n  \u2022 Second entrance: <quote> Moving toward the open door that led to the Room of the Dreaming,</quote> (Background, II).  \n    \u2013 The phrasing \u201cled to\u201d indicates a passage from one space to another distinct area.  \n  \u2022 Distinct furnishings: Bar A has \u201cbar stools,\u201d \u201cyellow wood\u201d bar, \u201crhumba band.\u201d Bar B has \u201ctier on tier of circling ramps,\u201d \u201cmat and headrest,\u201d \u201cpillows and thick rug,\u201d \u201cspotlight,\u201d and \u201ccurtain\u201d for Unger\u2019s performance (Background, II).  \n\n3. Contrasting Sensory Environment  \n  \u2022 Bar A: \u201cnoise \u2026 wild frantic beat of a Venusian rhumba,\u201d \u201csmoke,\u201d \u201clove feelings heavily tinged with straight sex,\u201d \u201capprehension, plain fear\u201d (Background, \u00b61).  \n  \u2022 Bar B: \u201csoul-quickening Perfume of the Dreamer,\u201d \u201cmusic playing strange harmonies \u2026 like lutes from heaven,\u201d \u201cpleasantly cool \u2026 feel of dampness,\u201d \u201chushed place,\u201d \u201cVenusians shifted \u2026 anticipation,\u201d \u201chypnotic trance\u201d (Background, II).  \n    \u2013 Such radical shift beyond mere stage lighting evokes an entirely different establishment.  \n\n4. Distinct Patron Behavior  \n  \u2022 In Bar A, patrons sit at stools and \u201ceases himself into an empty stool\u201d (Background, \u00b61).  \n  \u2022 In Bar B, patrons \u201centered the Room of the Dreamer,\u201d \u201cwent rapidly\u201d out of the trance (Background, II). Caldwell \u201csprawls to the floor\u201d on a ramp (Background, II), not a stool. They \u201cmove cushions\u201d to make him comfortable, not order drinks.  \n\nII. Rebuttal of One-Bar (\u201cSingle Venue\u201d) Arguments  \n1. \u201cNo New Drink Orders\u201d Fails to Show Same Bar  \n  \u2022 In specialized entertainment areas (e.g., Earth theaters), no drinks are served on stage. The Dream Room is performance-only. Lack of new orders indicates he has left the bar area.  \n2. \u201cHeadwaiter\u201d Continuity Misread  \n  \u2022 The original \u201cheadwaiter\u201d vanishes after seating Johnson in the dreaming area. He does not reappear to serve drinks there. A different set of \u201cVenusian watchers\u201d lie in wait in Bar B to dream, not bartend.  \n3. \u201cNo Re-Entry Described\u201d Ignoring Reservation Mechanics  \n  \u2022 Johnson\u2019s covert mission requires privacy to detect Martin\u2019s dream. If he remained in the noisy open bar, he couldn\u2019t see Unger\u2019s levitation unnoticed. Returning \u201cin one zonar\u201d to a darkened, hushed room suits clandestine observation.  \n4. \u201cSame Patrons\u201d Actually Follow Johnson  \n  \u2022 Caldwell\u2019s travel behind Johnson into the Room (Background, II) shows he follows Johnson through a separate doorway. \u201cSprawls to the floor\u201d indicates a new area without furniture.  \n\nIII. Functional and Strategic Necessity  \n1. Martin\u2019s Dream Monitoring Requires Dedicated Space  \n  \u2022 Only in the private Room can Johnson discern far-off space-ship vision without interference. An open bar would drown subtle radiations with \u201cnoise,\u201d \u201crhumba,\u201d and \u201cperfume cloud.\u201d  \n2. \u201cReservations\u201d Imply Exclusive Access  \n  \u2022 Reservations restrict entry, control the audience, and limit interference. This service must be separate to ensure the Dreamer\u2019s trance remains unbroken until Johnson chooses to break it.  \n\nIV. Conclusion  \nEvery element\u2014the explicit \u201creservations,\u201d distinct entrances, radically different architecture and atmosphere, patron behavior, and strategic need for privacy\u2014demonstrates two separate bars: the initial tarmur bar/lounge and the specialized Room of the Dreaming. Debater_A\u2019s attempt to collapse these venues ignores clear textual cues and the narrative logic of secret observation. Therefore, the correct answer is \u201cTwo.\u201d\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
