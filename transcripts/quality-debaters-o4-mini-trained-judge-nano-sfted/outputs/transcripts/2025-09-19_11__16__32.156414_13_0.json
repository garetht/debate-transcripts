The Holy Grail of middle-distance running was his. Forty-two years later, however, that achievement seems less significant. Four-minute miles are commonplace; the current record, held by Algerian Noureddine Morceli, is 3:44 , more than 5 percent faster than Bannister's speed. What Iffley Road witnessed was just another step along the road to an ever quicker mile, part of the inexorable improvement of athletic performance that we usually take for granted, particularly when the Olympics roll around. If you stop to think about it, though, such constant progress is remarkable. After all, as biomechanical machines with a standard set of parts, humans should be subject to the same limitations we see in, say, automobiles. How come they aren't? \n\n         A lot of entrepreneurs and technophiles would like us to think that the answer has to do with discoveries in the world of sports technology. A new Nike shoe is trumpeted as something that will shave at least one-thousandth of a second off your 100-meter time. Trainers measure the rate of buildup of lactic acid in your muscles, then claim that their programs will control it. Nutritionists fine-tune athletes' diets. Even the old sexual-abstinence-before-the-race dogma is being re-evaluated under the all-seeing eye of science. But I consider all this little more than tinkering. Sports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the same today as they were in 1896, when the first modern Olympics took place. These minor miracles are the product neither of technology nor of training but of demographic patterns that affect us all. \n\n         Over the past century, the human race has been affected by a slew of what demographers call \"secular\" trends. (In this context, \"secular\" does not refer to a trend's lack of spirituality but to its longevity: Secular trends are long-term modifications, not just brief fluctuations.) One such trend is an increase in average size. You have to stoop to get through the doorways of a Tudor cottage in England because its inhabitants were smaller than you are, not because they had a penchant for crouching. Another trend is in life expectancy. People are living longer. Life expectancy in Africa increased over the past 20 years from 46 to 53 years. Over the same period in Europe, where things were already pretty comfortable to begin with, life expectancy increased from 71 to 75 years. The global average was an increase from 58 to 65 years. \n\n          Probably the most striking change, though, is how much more quickly children are maturing. A 12-year-old child in 1990 who was in what the World Health Organization calls \"average economic circumstances\" was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart. This is not solely the product of the first trend--the increase in average size--but also due to the fact that children develop faster. Girls menstruate earlier than they used to. The age of menarche (the onset of menstruation) has decreased by three or four months per decade in average sections of Western European populations for the past 150 years. There is a good chance that our 1990 12-year-old already had started to menstruate. Her 1900 counterpart would still have had three years to wait. \n\n         What do such trends have to do with athletic performance? Well, if we're living longer and growing up faster, that must mean we're producing bigger, better bodies. Better bodies imply faster miles. We run faster and faster for the same reason it is now common for 11-year-old girls to menstruate. But why are these things happening? \n\n          Demographers have offered a variety of explanations, but the main one is that our diet is improving. A 12-year-old ate better in 1990 than she would have in the Victorian era. This conclusion is supported by studies of the social elite: Because its members were well-nourished even in the early years of this century, this group has experienced relatively little change, over the past 100 years, in the age girls first menstruate. Another explanation is that health care is getting better. In 1991, according to the WHO, more than 75 percent of all 1-year-olds worldwide were immunized against a range of common diseases. Smallpox, that scourge of previous generations, now is effectively extinct. Probably the best measure of how much healthier we are is the rate of infant mortality, which measures both the health of the mother (a sickly mother is more likely to produce a sickly baby) and the health of the baby. In the past 20 years, infant mortality around the world has dropped from 92 deaths per 1000 live births to just 62. A lot of this can be chalked up to primary-heath-care programs in the developing world--the African average, for instance, has dropped from 135 deaths per 1000 births to 95. But there are also significant improvements in the developed world, with infant deaths dropping in Europe over the same 20-year period from 24 per 1000 live births to just 10. \n\n         Better health care affects athletic ability directly. This is true in the trivial case in which, say, antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race, but it may also be true in a more significant way. Diseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health--not necessarily a big one, but an impact nevertheless. Previous generations bore scars from all sorts of non-life-threatening diseases, the stuff everyone picked up as a baby. Nowadays, though, more and more people grow up with no history of disease. Since top athletes inevitably are drawn from the healthiest sector of the population, a generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from. You are much more likely to find someone who can run a mile in 3:30 in a sample of several million superbly healthy people than you are in a sample of 10,000. \n\n         The pool of potential athletes has expanded in other ways, too. First, the population has exploded. Second, we are coming ever closer to a worldwide middle class, the class from which athletes typically are drawn. Whether, in an age of multinational capitalism, we may talk reasonably about a post-colonial era is way beyond the scope of this article. The fact remains, however, that the developing world is doing just that--developing. Even Mozambique, which ranks at, or near, the bottom of national per capita gross national product tables, has shown an increase of some 20 percent in adult literacy rates over the past 20 years. Literacy rates are merely an index of education, which itself is another way of talking about a global move away from a hand-to-mouth lifestyle. \n\n         The decline of empire has its Olympic corollaries. Britain won, on average, 17 gold medals per Olympics in the five official games held in its imperial heyday before World War I. That average has dropped to only five medals per Olympics in the 17 held since. This is not a reflection of declining athletic standards in Britain, however; it's a function of how much more competitive other nations have become. The Olympics originally were the preserve of the socioeconomic elite of the socioeconomic elite among nations. Consider this: Only 13 nations participated in 1896, but there were 172 in 1992. Black Africans didn't take part until the third modern games, held in St. Louis in 1908. Even this was accidental: Lentauw and Yamasami, Zulu tribesmen, entered the marathon because they happened to be in St. Louis as part of an exhibit about the Boer war. Lentauw finished ninth despite being chased into a cornfield by dogs. \n\n         Since all these are changes in how we live, not anything innate, we have to conclude that what we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes. Let us assume that our 1900 and 1990 12-year-olds are identical twins magically born 90 years apart. The 1990 girl still will grow up faster, end up bigger, menstruate earlier, and live longer than the 1900 girl. Perhaps way, way back in human history, when our forebears were still fleeing saber-toothed tigers, natural selection for athletic prowess came into play. But all that ended long ago. Indeed, the laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days: Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today's top athletes have fewer children than average. \n\n          Just because nurture has a more significant effect on athletic performance doesn't mean that nature lies dormant, though. Genetic variation exists for just about any trait you choose to study, and the ability to run quickly would be no exception. To take a trivial case, we know that the inheritance of extra fingers or toes is determined genetically. It is quite possible that the possession of an extra toe would hinder an aspiring miler--their genes have affected their athletic performance. One genetic factor that may be influencing performance trends is what is known as \"hybrid vigor.\" Cattle breeders have known about this for a long time: Take two inbred lines of cattle, cross them, and what you have is \"better\" (say, larger) than any single individual in either of the two parental lines. This does not require natural selection; it is the accidental byproduct of combining two previously isolated stocks. There are a number of theories to account for this at the genetic level, but it has proved difficult to discriminate among them. It is possible that modern humans exhibit some form of hybrid vigor simply because migration and admixture of populations are now occurring at unprecedented rates. Perhaps, just perhaps, such hybridization is being translated into enhanced performance. \n\n         That doesn't mean, however, that genetic differences in athletic ability can be correlated automatically with race. That is a claim that is impossible to test, because you cannot control, in an experimental sense, environmental differences among the study groups. Sure, you will find more Africans or descendants of Africans standing on the podiums at the end of Olympic track events. And you will find far fewer Asians on those same podiums. But can you, therefore, conclude that Africans have better genes for running than Asians do? No. Environmental differences between the two groups could account for differing levels of athletic success. It is scarcely surprising that Ethiopian or Kenyan distance runners do better than everyone else, since they are in the habit of running immense distances to and from primary school, middle school, and high school. The training is what's crucial, not the blackness. The Chinese sports establishment also has carried out an enormous, and effective, experiment to help dispel the myth that race has a direct relation to athletic ability. Until recently, a quick glance at the medals table confirmed every stereotype people held about Asians and sports. Then the Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners (and swimmers), and, boy, did they ever. In 1992, China ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal haul. \n\n         You can bring a single generation up to speed through training, but the trends we're dealing with transcend individual generations. Which brings us to another question: Will there come a time when the human machine will hit some sort of natural limit and an Olympic Games pass without a single record tumbling? In principle, yes. \n\n         There are some barriers that simply cannot be broken. We will never run a mile at the same speed at which we now run 100 meters, for instance. The laws of oxygen exchange will not permit it. Race horses seem already to have hit that outer limit. For years, they were as good as human athletes at pushing back speed records, but then they simply stopped getting faster. Take the prestigious British Derby. From 1850 to 1930, winning times dropped from 2:55 to 2:39. But from 1986 to 1996, the average time has been--2:39. Unlike people, race horses are specifically bred and reared to run. Generations of careful genetic selection have ensured that today's race horse has every possible speed-enhancing characteristic. Training techniques, too, are tremendously sophisticated. But you can go only so far. You can only breed horses with ultralight thin bones to a certain point; the bones will break under stress if they get any lighter. \n\n         Human improvement, like race-horse improvement, must eventually bow to the basic constraints of biomechanics. The age of menarche cannot keep on falling forever. On the other hand, it is clear from the remarkable demographic changes of just the past 20 years that these long-term trends are with us still. They may be slowing down in some more developed societies, but they roar along in others. And these trends will continue to fuel the improvement in athletic performance. Several new records will be set in Atlanta. And in Sydney in 2000, and wherever the Olympics are held in 2044. We will continue running faster and jumping further for a good long while to come.\n",

Since top athletes inevitably are drawn from the healthiest sector of the population, a generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from. You are much more likely to find someone who can run a mile in 3:30 in a sample of several million superbly healthy people than you are in a sample of 10,000. \n\n         The pool of potential athletes has expanded in other ways, too. First, the population has exploded. Second, we are coming ever closer to a worldwide middle class, the class from which athletes typically are drawn. Whether, in an age of multinational capitalism, we may talk reasonably about a post-colonial era is way beyond the scope of this article. The fact remains, however, that the developing world is doing just that--developing. Even Mozambique, which ranks at, or near, the bottom of national per capita gross national product tables, has shown an increase of some 20 percent in adult literacy rates over the past 20 years. Literacy rates are merely an index of education, which itself is another way of talking about a global move away from a hand-to-mouth lifestyle. \n\n         The decline of empire has its Olympic corollaries. Britain won, on average, 17 gold medals per Olympics in the five official games held in its imperial heyday before World War I. That average has dropped to only five medals per Olympics in the 17 held since. This is not a reflection of declining athletic standards in Britain, however; it's a function of how much more competitive other nations have become. The Olympics originally were the preserve of the socioeconomic elite of the socioeconomic elite among nations. Consider this: Only 13 nations participated in 1896, but there were 172 in 1992. Black Africans didn't take part until the third modern games, held in St. Louis in 1908. Even this was accidental: Lentauw and Yamasami, Zulu tribesmen, entered the marathon because they happened to be in St. Louis as part of an exhibit about the Boer war. Lentauw finished ninth despite being chased into a cornfield by dogs. \n\n         Since all these are changes in how we live, not anything innate, we have to conclude that what we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes. Let us assume that our 1900 and 1990 12-year-olds are identical twins magically born 90 years apart. The 1990 girl still will grow up faster, end up bigger, menstruate earlier, and live longer than the 1900 girl. Perhaps way, way back in human history, when our forebears were still fleeing saber-toothed tigers, natural selection for athletic prowess came into play. But all that ended long ago. Indeed, the laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days: Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today's top athletes have fewer children than average. \n\n          Just because nurture has a more significant effect on athletic performance doesn't mean that nature lies dormant, though. Genetic variation exists for just about any trait you choose to study, and the ability to run quickly would be no exception. To take a trivial case, we know that the inheritance of extra fingers or toes is determined genetically. It is quite possible that the possession of an extra toe would hinder an aspiring miler--their genes have affected their athletic performance. One genetic factor that may be influencing performance trends is what is known as \"hybrid vigor.\" Cattle breeders have known about this for a long time: Take two inbred lines of cattle, cross them, and what you have is \"better\" (say, larger) than any single individual in either of the two parental lines. This does not require natural selection; it is the accidental byproduct of combining two previously isolated stocks. There are a number of theories to account for this at the genetic level, but it has proved difficult to discriminate among them. It is possible that modern humans exhibit some form of hybrid vigor simply because migration and admixture of populations are now occurring at unprecedented rates. Perhaps, just perhaps, such hybridization is being translated into enhanced performance. \n\n         That doesn't mean, however, that genetic differences in athletic ability can be correlated automatically with race. That is a claim that is impossible to test, because you cannot control, in an experimental sense, environmental differences among the study groups. Sure, you will find more Africans or descendants of Africans standing on the podiums at the end of Olympic track events. And you will find far fewer Asians on those same podiums. But can you, therefore, conclude that Africans have better genes for running than Asians do? No. Environmental differences between the two groups could account for differing levels of athletic success. It is scarcely surprising that Ethiopian or Kenyan distance runners do better than everyone else, since they are in the habit of running immense distances to and from primary school, middle school, and high school. The training is what's crucial, not the blackness. The Chinese sports establishment also has carried out an enormous, and effective, experiment to help dispel the myth that race has a direct relation to athletic ability. Until recently, a quick glance at the medals table confirmed every stereotype people held about Asians and sports. Then the Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners (and swimmers), and, boy, did they ever. In 1992, China ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal haul. \n\n         You can bring a single generation up to speed through training, but the trends we're dealing with transcend individual generations. Which brings us to another question: Will there come a time when the human machine will hit some sort of natural limit and an Olympic Games pass without a single record tumbling? In principle, yes. \n\n         There are some barriers that simply cannot be broken. We will never run a mile at the same speed at which we now run 100 meters, for instance. The laws of oxygen exchange will not permit it. Race horses seem already to have hit that outer limit. For years, they were as good as human athletes at pushing back speed records, but then they simply stopped getting faster. Take the prestigious British Derby. From 1850 to 1930, winning times dropped from 2:55 to 2:39. But from 1986 to 1996, the average time has been--2:39. Unlike people, race horses are specifically bred and reared to run. Generations of careful genetic selection have ensured that today's race horse has every possible speed-enhancing characteristic. Training techniques, too, are tremendously sophisticated. But you can go only so far. You can only breed horses with ultralight thin bones to a certain point; the bones will break under stress if they get any lighter. \n\n         Human improvement, like race-horse improvement, must eventually bow to the basic constraints of biomechanics. The age of menarche cannot keep on falling forever. On the other hand, it is clear from the remarkable demographic changes of just the past 20 years that these long-term trends are with us still. They may be slowing down in some more developed societies, but they roar along in others. And these trends will continue to fuel the improvement in athletic performance. Several new records will be set in Atlanta. And in Sydney in 2000, and wherever the Olympics are held in 2044. We will continue running faster and jumping further for a good long while to come.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat did the Chinese do to help dispell the idea that racial differences determined racing speed?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Starting from nothing, they dramatically improved the performance of their women distance event competitors by improving their training, to rank fourth in medals won  in the Olympics of the early 1990s.\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"The Chinese conducted extremely effective selection events.

The Holy Grail of middle-distance running was his. Forty-two years later, however, that achievement seems less significant. Four-minute miles are commonplace; the current record, held by Algerian Noureddine Morceli, is 3:44 , more than 5 percent faster than Bannister's speed. What Iffley Road witnessed was just another step along the road to an ever quicker mile, part of the inexorable improvement of athletic performance that we usually take for granted, particularly when the Olympics roll around. If you stop to think about it, though, such constant progress is remarkable. After all, as biomechanical machines with a standard set of parts, humans should be subject to the same limitations we see in, say, automobiles. How come they aren't? \n\n         A lot of entrepreneurs and technophiles would like us to think that the answer has to do with discoveries in the world of sports technology. A new Nike shoe is trumpeted as something that will shave at least one-thousandth of a second off your 100-meter time. Trainers measure the rate of buildup of lactic acid in your muscles, then claim that their programs will control it. Nutritionists fine-tune athletes' diets. Even the old sexual-abstinence-before-the-race dogma is being re-evaluated under the all-seeing eye of science. But I consider all this little more than tinkering. Sports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the same today as they were in 1896, when the first modern Olympics took place. These minor miracles are the product neither of technology nor of training but of demographic patterns that affect us all. \n\n         Over the past century, the human race has been affected by a slew of what demographers call \"secular\" trends. (In this context, \"secular\" does not refer to a trend's lack of spirituality but to its longevity: Secular trends are long-term modifications, not just brief fluctuations.) One such trend is an increase in average size. You have to stoop to get through the doorways of a Tudor cottage in England because its inhabitants were smaller than you are, not because they had a penchant for crouching. Another trend is in life expectancy. People are living longer. Life expectancy in Africa increased over the past 20 years from 46 to 53 years. Over the same period in Europe, where things were already pretty comfortable to begin with, life expectancy increased from 71 to 75 years. The global average was an increase from 58 to 65 years. \n\n          Probably the most striking change, though, is how much more quickly children are maturing. A 12-year-old child in 1990 who was in what the World Health Organization calls \"average economic circumstances\" was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart. This is not solely the product of the first trend--the increase in average size--but also due to the fact that children develop faster. Girls menstruate earlier than they used to. The age of menarche (the onset of menstruation) has decreased by three or four months per decade in average sections of Western European populations for the past 150 years. There is a good chance that our 1990 12-year-old already had started to menstruate. Her 1900 counterpart would still have had three years to wait. \n\n         What do such trends have to do with athletic performance? Well, if we're living longer and growing up faster, that must mean we're producing bigger, better bodies. Better bodies imply faster miles. We run faster and faster for the same reason it is now common for 11-year-old girls to menstruate. But why are these things happening? \n\n          Demographers have offered a variety of explanations, but the main one is that our diet is improving. A 12-year-old ate better in 1990 than she would have in the Victorian era. This conclusion is supported by studies of the social elite: Because its members were well-nourished even in the early years of this century, this group has experienced relatively little change, over the past 100 years, in the age girls first menstruate. Another explanation is that health care is getting better. In 1991, according to the WHO, more than 75 percent of all 1-year-olds worldwide were immunized against a range of common diseases. Smallpox, that scourge of previous generations, now is effectively extinct. Probably the best measure of how much healthier we are is the rate of infant mortality, which measures both the health of the mother (a sickly mother is more likely to produce a sickly baby) and the health of the baby. In the past 20 years, infant mortality around the world has dropped from 92 deaths per 1000 live births to just 62. A lot of this can be chalked up to primary-heath-care programs in the developing world--the African average, for instance, has dropped from 135 deaths per 1000 births to 95. But there are also significant improvements in the developed world, with infant deaths dropping in Europe over the same 20-year period from 24 per 1000 live births to just 10. \n\n         Better health care affects athletic ability directly. This is true in the trivial case in which, say, antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race, but it may also be true in a more significant way. Diseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health--not necessarily a big one, but an impact nevertheless. Previous generations bore scars from all sorts of non-life-threatening diseases, the stuff everyone picked up as a baby. Nowadays, though, more and more people grow up with no history of disease. Since top athletes inevitably are drawn from the healthiest sector of the population, a generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from. You are much more likely to find someone who can run a mile in 3:30 in a sample of several million superbly healthy people than you are in a sample of 10,000. \n\n         The pool of potential athletes has expanded in other ways, too. First, the population has exploded. Second, we are coming ever closer to a worldwide middle class, the class from which athletes typically are drawn. Whether, in an age of multinational capitalism, we may talk reasonably about a post-colonial era is way beyond the scope of this article. The fact remains, however, that the developing world is doing just that--developing. Even Mozambique, which ranks at, or near, the bottom of national per capita gross national product tables, has shown an increase of some 20 percent in adult literacy rates over the past 20 years. Literacy rates are merely an index of education, which itself is another way of talking about a global move away from a hand-to-mouth lifestyle. \n\n         The decline of empire has its Olympic corollaries. Britain won, on average, 17 gold medals per Olympics in the five official games held in its imperial heyday before World War I. That average has dropped to only five medals per Olympics in the 17 held since. This is not a reflection of declining athletic standards in Britain, however; it's a function of how much more competitive other nations have become. The Olympics originally were the preserve of the socioeconomic elite of the socioeconomic elite among nations. Consider this: Only 13 nations participated in 1896, but there were 172 in 1992.

Even this was accidental: Lentauw and Yamasami, Zulu tribesmen, entered the marathon because they happened to be in St. Louis as part of an exhibit about the Boer war. Lentauw finished ninth despite being chased into a cornfield by dogs. \n\n         Since all these are changes in how we live, not anything innate, we have to conclude that what we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes. Let us assume that our 1900 and 1990 12-year-olds are identical twins magically born 90 years apart. The 1990 girl still will grow up faster, end up bigger, menstruate earlier, and live longer than the 1900 girl.

Then the Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners (and swimmers), and, boy, did they ever. In 1992, China ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal haul. \n\n         You can bring a single generation up to speed through training, but the trends we're dealing with transcend individual generations.

The Holy Grail of middle-distance running was his. Forty-two years later, however, that achievement seems less significant. Four-minute miles are commonplace; the current record, held by Algerian Noureddine Morceli, is 3:44 , more than 5 percent faster than Bannister's speed. What Iffley Road witnessed was just another step along the road to an ever quicker mile, part of the inexorable improvement of athletic performance that we usually take for granted, particularly when the Olympics roll around. If you stop to think about it, though, such constant progress is remarkable. After all, as biomechanical machines with a standard set of parts, humans should be subject to the same limitations we see in, say, automobiles. How come they aren't? \n\n         A lot of entrepreneurs and technophiles would like us to think that the answer has to do with discoveries in the world of sports technology. A new Nike shoe is trumpeted as something that will shave at least one-thousandth of a second off your 100-meter time. Trainers measure the rate of buildup of lactic acid in your muscles, then claim that their programs will control it. Nutritionists fine-tune athletes' diets. Even the old sexual-abstinence-before-the-race dogma is being re-evaluated under the all-seeing eye of science. But I consider all this little more than tinkering. Sports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the same today as they were in 1896, when the first modern Olympics took place. These minor miracles are the product neither of technology nor of training but of demographic patterns that affect us all. \n\n         Over the past century, the human race has been affected by a slew of what demographers call \"secular\" trends. (In this context, \"secular\" does not refer to a trend's lack of spirituality but to its longevity: Secular trends are long-term modifications, not just brief fluctuations.) One such trend is an increase in average size. You have to stoop to get through the doorways of a Tudor cottage in England because its inhabitants were smaller than you are, not because they had a penchant for crouching. Another trend is in life expectancy. People are living longer. Life expectancy in Africa increased over the past 20 years from 46 to 53 years. Over the same period in Europe, where things were already pretty comfortable to begin with, life expectancy increased from 71 to 75 years. The global average was an increase from 58 to 65 years. \n\n          Probably the most striking change, though, is how much more quickly children are maturing. A 12-year-old child in 1990 who was in what the World Health Organization calls \"average economic circumstances\" was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart. This is not solely the product of the first trend--the increase in average size--but also due to the fact that children develop faster. Girls menstruate earlier than they used to. The age of menarche (the onset of menstruation) has decreased by three or four months per decade in average sections of Western European populations for the past 150 years. There is a good chance that our 1990 12-year-old already had started to menstruate. Her 1900 counterpart would still have had three years to wait. \n\n         What do such trends have to do with athletic performance? Well, if we're living longer and growing up faster, that must mean we're producing bigger, better bodies. Better bodies imply faster miles. We run faster and faster for the same reason it is now common for 11-year-old girls to menstruate. But why are these things happening? \n\n          Demographers have offered a variety of explanations, but the main one is that our diet is improving. A 12-year-old ate better in 1990 than she would have in the Victorian era. This conclusion is supported by studies of the social elite: Because its members were well-nourished even in the early years of this century, this group has experienced relatively little change, over the past 100 years, in the age girls first menstruate. Another explanation is that health care is getting better. In 1991, according to the WHO, more than 75 percent of all 1-year-olds worldwide were immunized against a range of common diseases. Smallpox, that scourge of previous generations, now is effectively extinct. Probably the best measure of how much healthier we are is the rate of infant mortality, which measures both the health of the mother (a sickly mother is more likely to produce a sickly baby) and the health of the baby. In the past 20 years, infant mortality around the world has dropped from 92 deaths per 1000 live births to just 62. A lot of this can be chalked up to primary-heath-care programs in the developing world--the African average, for instance, has dropped from 135 deaths per 1000 births to 95. But there are also significant improvements in the developed world, with infant deaths dropping in Europe over the same 20-year period from 24 per 1000 live births to just 10. \n\n         Better health care affects athletic ability directly. This is true in the trivial case in which, say, antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race, but it may also be true in a more significant way. Diseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health--not necessarily a big one, but an impact nevertheless. Previous generations bore scars from all sorts of non-life-threatening diseases, the stuff everyone picked up as a baby. Nowadays, though, more and more people grow up with no history of disease. Since top athletes inevitably are drawn from the healthiest sector of the population, a generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from. You are much more likely to find someone who can run a mile in 3:30 in a sample of several million superbly healthy people than you are in a sample of 10,000. \n\n         The pool of potential athletes has expanded in other ways, too. First, the population has exploded. Second, we are coming ever closer to a worldwide middle class, the class from which athletes typically are drawn. Whether, in an age of multinational capitalism, we may talk reasonably about a post-colonial era is way beyond the scope of this article. The fact remains, however, that the developing world is doing just that--developing. Even Mozambique, which ranks at, or near, the bottom of national per capita gross national product tables, has shown an increase of some 20 percent in adult literacy rates over the past 20 years. Literacy rates are merely an index of education, which itself is another way of talking about a global move away from a hand-to-mouth lifestyle. \n\n         The decline of empire has its Olympic corollaries. Britain won, on average, 17 gold medals per Olympics in the five official games held in its imperial heyday before World War I. That average has dropped to only five medals per Olympics in the 17 held since. This is not a reflection of declining athletic standards in Britain, however; it's a function of how much more competitive other nations have become. The Olympics originally were the preserve of the socioeconomic elite of the socioeconomic elite among nations. Consider this: Only 13 nations participated in 1896, but there were 172 in 1992. Black Africans didn't take part until the third modern games, held in St. Louis in 1908. Even this was accidental: Lentauw and Yamasami, Zulu tribesmen, entered the marathon because they happened to be in St. Louis as part of an exhibit about the Boer war. Lentauw finished ninth despite being chased into a cornfield by dogs. \n\n         Since all these are changes in how we live, not anything innate, we have to conclude that what we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes. Let us assume that our 1900 and 1990 12-year-olds are identical twins magically born 90 years apart. The 1990 girl still will grow up faster, end up bigger, menstruate earlier, and live longer than the 1900 girl. Perhaps way, way back in human history, when our forebears were still fleeing saber-toothed tigers, natural selection for athletic prowess came into play. But all that ended long ago. Indeed, the laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days: Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today's top athletes have fewer children than average. \n\n          Just because nurture has a more significant effect on athletic performance doesn't mean that nature lies dormant, though. Genetic variation exists for just about any trait you choose to study, and the ability to run quickly would be no exception. To take a trivial case, we know that the inheritance of extra fingers or toes is determined genetically. It is quite possible that the possession of an extra toe would hinder an aspiring miler--their genes have affected their athletic performance. One genetic factor that may be influencing performance trends is what is known as \"hybrid vigor.\" Cattle breeders have known about this for a long time: Take two inbred lines of cattle, cross them, and what you have is \"better\" (say, larger) than any single individual in either of the two parental lines. This does not require natural selection; it is the accidental byproduct of combining two previously isolated stocks. There are a number of theories to account for this at the genetic level, but it has proved difficult to discriminate among them. It is possible that modern humans exhibit some form of hybrid vigor simply because migration and admixture of populations are now occurring at unprecedented rates. Perhaps, just perhaps, such hybridization is being translated into enhanced performance. \n\n         That doesn't mean, however, that genetic differences in athletic ability can be correlated automatically with race. That is a claim that is impossible to test, because you cannot control, in an experimental sense, environmental differences among the study groups. Sure, you will find more Africans or descendants of Africans standing on the podiums at the end of Olympic track events. And you will find far fewer Asians on those same podiums. But can you, therefore, conclude that Africans have better genes for running than Asians do? No. Environmental differences between the two groups could account for differing levels of athletic success. It is scarcely surprising that Ethiopian or Kenyan distance runners do better than everyone else, since they are in the habit of running immense distances to and from primary school, middle school, and high school. The training is what's crucial, not the blackness. The Chinese sports establishment also has carried out an enormous, and effective, experiment to help dispel the myth that race has a direct relation to athletic ability. Until recently, a quick glance at the medals table confirmed every stereotype people held about Asians and sports. Then the Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners (and swimmers), and, boy, did they ever. In 1992, China ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal haul. \n\n         You can bring a single generation up to speed through training, but the trends we're dealing with transcend individual generations. Which brings us to another question: Will there come a time when the human machine will hit some sort of natural limit and an Olympic Games pass without a single record tumbling? In principle, yes. \n\n         There are some barriers that simply cannot be broken. We will never run a mile at the same speed at which we now run 100 meters, for instance. The laws of oxygen exchange will not permit it. Race horses seem already to have hit that outer limit. For years, they were as good as human athletes at pushing back speed records, but then they simply stopped getting faster. Take the prestigious British Derby. From 1850 to 1930, winning times dropped from 2:55 to 2:39. But from 1986 to 1996, the average time has been--2:39. Unlike people, race horses are specifically bred and reared to run. Generations of careful genetic selection have ensured that today's race horse has every possible speed-enhancing characteristic. Training techniques, too, are tremendously sophisticated. But you can go only so far. You can only breed horses with ultralight thin bones to a certain point; the bones will break under stress if they get any lighter. \n\n         Human improvement, like race-horse improvement, must eventually bow to the basic constraints of biomechanics. The age of menarche cannot keep on falling forever. On the other hand, it is clear from the remarkable demographic changes of just the past 20 years that these long-term trends are with us still. They may be slowing down in some more developed societies, but they roar along in others. And these trends will continue to fuel the improvement in athletic performance. Several new records will be set in Atlanta. And in Sydney in 2000, and wherever the Olympics are held in 2044. We will continue running faster and jumping further for a good long while to come.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat did the Chinese do to help dispell the idea that racial differences determined racing speed?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Starting from nothing, they dramatically improved the performance of their women distance event competitors by improving their training, to rank fourth in medals won  in the Olympics of the early 1990s.\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"The Chinese conducted extremely effective selection events. With a billion people, they were well-positioned to find more good runners if they just looked.\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The Chinese conducted extremely effective selection events. With a billion people, they were well-positioned to find more good runners if they just looked.\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for the \u201cSelection\u2010Pool\u201d Explanation\n\n1. Large Population Enables Rare Talent Discovery  \n  a. <invalid_quote>\u201cThe pool of potential athletes has expanded \u2026 the population has exploded \u2026\u201d</invalid_quote> (Berry, \u00a77). With over a billion people, China\u2019s chance of finding exceptional runners\u2014even without radically novel training\u2014rises simply by numbers. Exceptional genetic variants for endurance (\u201cnature\u201d) become more common in larger samples.  \n  b. This mirrors how global secular trends improve performance: records fall as sample size grows, not because every individual changes. China tapped into its expanded demographic pool to produce \u201crecord\u2010breaking \u2026 female distance runners\u201d (Berry, \u00a79).\n\n2. Speed of Improvement Implies Preexisting Potential, Not Just Training  \n  a. If training alone drove world\u2010class performance, we would see gradual improvements over generations as methods diffused. Instead, China\u2019s runners appeared suddenly and dramatically in the early 1990s, jumping from near zero to fourth in medals in one Olympic cycle (Berry, \u00a79).  \n  b. This rapid ascendance is characteristic of selection of outliers, not incremental training gains.  \n\n3. Training Success Requires Talent; Selection Amplifies It  \n  a. Even the strongest training regimens can only optimize athletes within the bounds of their innate capacity. Locating individuals with superior biomechanical and physiological traits is prerequisite to world\u2010class performance.  \n  b. The fact that Kenya\u2019s distance dominance arose in rural youth accustomed to running implies environmental exposure plus innate endurance capacity. Similarly, China\u2019s program selected those with both.\n\n4. Objections to \u201cTraining\u2010Only\u201d View  \n  a. Debater_B ignores that many countries employ advanced training without comparable sudden success. If training per se were sufficient, China would have risen gradually as methods matured; instead, the dramatic leap indicates selection.  \n  b. Berry warns that environmental advantages alone cannot substitute for genetic variation: <invalid_quote>\u201cQuantitative limits\u201d like biomechanics will eventually cap performance</invalid_quote> (Berry, \u00a711). To approach those limits, one must first find outliers through selection.  \n  c. Without selection, the law of diminishing returns applies: improved shoes or nutrition \u201ctinkering\u201d yields only minuscule time savings (<quote> shave at least one-thousandth of a second </quote>, Berry, \u00a72), not Olympic\u2010medal\u2010changing performance.\n\n5. Consistency with Other Historical Examples  \n  a. Race horses are \u201cspecifically bred \u2026 generations of careful genetic selection\u201d to approach biomechanical limits (Berry, \u00a711). Their plateau suggests selection is essential for going as far as possible.  \n  b. Humans cannot be exception; China\u2019s sudden success mirrors selective breeding, albeit without controlled genetics.\n\nConclusion  \nChina\u2019s Olympic rise in women\u2019s distance events showcases the power of mining an enormous demographic and selecting those with innate superior capacities. Training merely polishes; selection finds the raw material. Thus, their program dispelled racial\u2010gene myths by showing that, when you look harder in a large population, you find world\u2010class athletes regardless of race, rather than by innovating training alone.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cTraining\u2010Driven Improvement\u201d (Debater_B\u2019s Position)\n\n1.

Debater_A\u2019s claim reduces to \u201cmore people \u2192 better athletes.\u201d Yet China had 1.2 billion people in 1896 era but sent virtually no Olympians until modern training programs. If sheer numbers sufficed, China would have dominated earlier.  \n   b. The same demographic argument fails within the text for race horses: \u201crace horses\u2026are specifically bred and reared\u2026But then\u2026stopped getting faster\u201d despite unlimited selection opportunities.  \n   c. Debater_A ignores that all nations now have large populations; only those that emphasize training (Kenya, Ethiopia, China) become elite on world stage.\n\n5. Training vs. Genetic Race Hypothesis  \n   a. If Africans\u2019 success in distance running were genetic, Chinese could not so swiftly equal or surpass them via training alone. Yet Chinese women indeed shattered Asian and world records, confirming environment\u2019s primacy.  \n   b. The author: <quote> The training is what's crucial, not the blackness. </quote> Thus China\u2019s success \u201cdispels the myth that race has a direct relation.\u201d\n\nConclusion  \nThe only plausible explanation for China\u2019s meteoric rise in women\u2019s distance events\u2014from negligible presence to 4th-place medal ranking\u2014is the imposition of rigorous training programs and infrastructure, mirroring the article\u2019s thesis that environment and nurturing drive athletic performance. Debater_A\u2019s population-selection theory cannot account for rapid generational change or why giant nations lacking such programs fail to produce champions.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The Chinese conducted extremely effective selection events. With a billion people, they were well-positioned to find more good runners if they just looked.\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

The Holy Grail of middle-distance running was his. Forty-two years later, however, that achievement seems less significant. Four-minute miles are commonplace; the current record, held by Algerian Noureddine Morceli, is 3:44 , more than 5 percent faster than Bannister's speed. What Iffley Road witnessed was just another step along the road to an ever quicker mile, part of the inexorable improvement of athletic performance that we usually take for granted, particularly when the Olympics roll around. If you stop to think about it, though, such constant progress is remarkable. After all, as biomechanical machines with a standard set of parts, humans should be subject to the same limitations we see in, say, automobiles. How come they aren't? \n\n         A lot of entrepreneurs and technophiles would like us to think that the answer has to do with discoveries in the world of sports technology. A new Nike shoe is trumpeted as something that will shave at least one-thousandth of a second off your 100-meter time. Trainers measure the rate of buildup of lactic acid in your muscles, then claim that their programs will control it. Nutritionists fine-tune athletes' diets. Even the old sexual-abstinence-before-the-race dogma is being re-evaluated under the all-seeing eye of science. But I consider all this little more than tinkering. Sports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the same today as they were in 1896, when the first modern Olympics took place. These minor miracles are the product neither of technology nor of training but of demographic patterns that affect us all. \n\n         Over the past century, the human race has been affected by a slew of what demographers call \"secular\" trends. (In this context, \"secular\" does not refer to a trend's lack of spirituality but to its longevity: Secular trends are long-term modifications, not just brief fluctuations.) One such trend is an increase in average size. You have to stoop to get through the doorways of a Tudor cottage in England because its inhabitants were smaller than you are, not because they had a penchant for crouching. Another trend is in life expectancy. People are living longer. Life expectancy in Africa increased over the past 20 years from 46 to 53 years. Over the same period in Europe, where things were already pretty comfortable to begin with, life expectancy increased from 71 to 75 years. The global average was an increase from 58 to 65 years. \n\n          Probably the most striking change, though, is how much more quickly children are maturing. A 12-year-old child in 1990 who was in what the World Health Organization calls \"average economic circumstances\" was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart. This is not solely the product of the first trend--the increase in average size--but also due to the fact that children develop faster. Girls menstruate earlier than they used to. The age of menarche (the onset of menstruation) has decreased by three or four months per decade in average sections of Western European populations for the past 150 years. There is a good chance that our 1990 12-year-old already had started to menstruate. Her 1900 counterpart would still have had three years to wait. \n\n         What do such trends have to do with athletic performance? Well, if we're living longer and growing up faster, that must mean we're producing bigger, better bodies. Better bodies imply faster miles. We run faster and faster for the same reason it is now common for 11-year-old girls to menstruate. But why are these things happening? \n\n          Demographers have offered a variety of explanations, but the main one is that our diet is improving. A 12-year-old ate better in 1990 than she would have in the Victorian era. This conclusion is supported by studies of the social elite: Because its members were well-nourished even in the early years of this century, this group has experienced relatively little change, over the past 100 years, in the age girls first menstruate. Another explanation is that health care is getting better. In 1991, according to the WHO, more than 75 percent of all 1-year-olds worldwide were immunized against a range of common diseases. Smallpox, that scourge of previous generations, now is effectively extinct. Probably the best measure of how much healthier we are is the rate of infant mortality, which measures both the health of the mother (a sickly mother is more likely to produce a sickly baby) and the health of the baby. In the past 20 years, infant mortality around the world has dropped from 92 deaths per 1000 live births to just 62. A lot of this can be chalked up to primary-heath-care programs in the developing world--the African average, for instance, has dropped from 135 deaths per 1000 births to 95. But there are also significant improvements in the developed world, with infant deaths dropping in Europe over the same 20-year period from 24 per 1000 live births to just 10. \n\n         Better health care affects athletic ability directly. This is true in the trivial case in which, say, antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race, but it may also be true in a more significant way. Diseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health--not necessarily a big one, but an impact nevertheless. Previous generations bore scars from all sorts of non-life-threatening diseases, the stuff everyone picked up as a baby. Nowadays, though, more and more people grow up with no history of disease. Since top athletes inevitably are drawn from the healthiest sector of the population, a generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from. You are much more likely to find someone who can run a mile in 3:30 in a sample of several million superbly healthy people than you are in a sample of 10,000. \n\n         The pool of potential athletes has expanded in other ways, too. First, the population has exploded. Second, we are coming ever closer to a worldwide middle class, the class from which athletes typically are drawn. Whether, in an age of multinational capitalism, we may talk reasonably about a post-colonial era is way beyond the scope of this article. The fact remains, however, that the developing world is doing just that--developing. Even Mozambique, which ranks at, or near, the bottom of national per capita gross national product tables, has shown an increase of some 20 percent in adult literacy rates over the past 20 years. Literacy rates are merely an index of education, which itself is another way of talking about a global move away from a hand-to-mouth lifestyle. \n\n         The decline of empire has its Olympic corollaries. Britain won, on average, 17 gold medals per Olympics in the five official games held in its imperial heyday before World War I. That average has dropped to only five medals per Olympics in the 17 held since. This is not a reflection of declining athletic standards in Britain, however; it's a function of how much more competitive other nations have become. The Olympics originally were the preserve of the socioeconomic elite of the socioeconomic elite among nations. Consider this: Only 13 nations participated in 1896, but there were 172 in 1992. Black Africans didn't take part until the third modern games, held in St. Louis in 1908. Even this was accidental: Lentauw and Yamasami, Zulu tribesmen, entered the marathon because they happened to be in St. Louis as part of an exhibit about the Boer war. Lentauw finished ninth despite being chased into a cornfield by dogs. \n\n         Since all these are changes in how we live, not anything innate, we have to conclude that what we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes. Let us assume that our 1900 and 1990 12-year-olds are identical twins magically born 90 years apart. The 1990 girl still will grow up faster, end up bigger, menstruate earlier, and live longer than the 1900 girl. Perhaps way, way back in human history, when our forebears were still fleeing saber-toothed tigers, natural selection for athletic prowess came into play. But all that ended long ago. Indeed, the laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days: Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today's top athletes have fewer children than average. \n\n          Just because nurture has a more significant effect on athletic performance doesn't mean that nature lies dormant, though. Genetic variation exists for just about any trait you choose to study, and the ability to run quickly would be no exception. To take a trivial case, we know that the inheritance of extra fingers or toes is determined genetically. It is quite possible that the possession of an extra toe would hinder an aspiring miler--their genes have affected their athletic performance. One genetic factor that may be influencing performance trends is what is known as \"hybrid vigor.\" Cattle breeders have known about this for a long time: Take two inbred lines of cattle, cross them, and what you have is \"better\" (say, larger) than any single individual in either of the two parental lines. This does not require natural selection; it is the accidental byproduct of combining two previously isolated stocks. There are a number of theories to account for this at the genetic level, but it has proved difficult to discriminate among them. It is possible that modern humans exhibit some form of hybrid vigor simply because migration and admixture of populations are now occurring at unprecedented rates. Perhaps, just perhaps, such hybridization is being translated into enhanced performance. \n\n         That doesn't mean, however, that genetic differences in athletic ability can be correlated automatically with race. That is a claim that is impossible to test, because you cannot control, in an experimental sense, environmental differences among the study groups. Sure, you will find more Africans or descendants of Africans standing on the podiums at the end of Olympic track events. And you will find far fewer Asians on those same podiums. But can you, therefore, conclude that Africans have better genes for running than Asians do? No. Environmental differences between the two groups could account for differing levels of athletic success. It is scarcely surprising that Ethiopian or Kenyan distance runners do better than everyone else, since they are in the habit of running immense distances to and from primary school, middle school, and high school. The training is what's crucial, not the blackness. The Chinese sports establishment also has carried out an enormous, and effective, experiment to help dispel the myth that race has a direct relation to athletic ability. Until recently, a quick glance at the medals table confirmed every stereotype people held about Asians and sports. Then the Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners (and swimmers), and, boy, did they ever. In 1992, China ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal haul. \n\n         You can bring a single generation up to speed through training, but the trends we're dealing with transcend individual generations. Which brings us to another question: Will there come a time when the human machine will hit some sort of natural limit and an Olympic Games pass without a single record tumbling? In principle, yes. \n\n         There are some barriers that simply cannot be broken. We will never run a mile at the same speed at which we now run 100 meters, for instance. The laws of oxygen exchange will not permit it. Race horses seem already to have hit that outer limit. For years, they were as good as human athletes at pushing back speed records, but then they simply stopped getting faster. Take the prestigious British Derby. From 1850 to 1930, winning times dropped from 2:55 to 2:39. But from 1986 to 1996, the average time has been--2:39. Unlike people, race horses are specifically bred and reared to run. Generations of careful genetic selection have ensured that today's race horse has every possible speed-enhancing characteristic. Training techniques, too, are tremendously sophisticated. But you can go only so far. You can only breed horses with ultralight thin bones to a certain point; the bones will break under stress if they get any lighter. \n\n         Human improvement, like race-horse improvement, must eventually bow to the basic constraints of biomechanics. The age of menarche cannot keep on falling forever. On the other hand, it is clear from the remarkable demographic changes of just the past 20 years that these long-term trends are with us still. They may be slowing down in some more developed societies, but they roar along in others. And these trends will continue to fuel the improvement in athletic performance. Several new records will be set in Atlanta. And in Sydney in 2000, and wherever the Olympics are held in 2044. We will continue running faster and jumping further for a good long while to come.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat did the Chinese do to help dispell the idea that racial differences determined racing speed?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"The Chinese conducted extremely effective selection events.

The Chinese program parallels these secular environmental trends but localized and intensified.\n\n4. Counter-Objections to Debater_A\u2019s \u201cPopulation Selection\u201d Theory  \n   a. Debater_A\u2019s claim reduces to \u201cmore people \u2192 better athletes.\u201d Yet China had 1.2 billion people in 1896 era but sent virtually no Olympians until modern training programs. If sheer numbers sufficed, China would have dominated earlier.  \n   b. The same demographic argument fails within the text for race horses: \u201crace horses\u2026are specifically bred and reared\u2026But then\u2026stopped getting faster\u201d despite unlimited selection opportunities.  \n   c. Debater_A ignores that all nations now have large populations; only those that emphasize training (Kenya, Ethiopia, China) become elite on world stage.\n\n5. Training vs. Genetic Race Hypothesis  \n   a. If Africans\u2019 success in distance running were genetic, Chinese could not so swiftly equal or surpass them via training alone. Yet Chinese women indeed shattered Asian and world records, confirming environment\u2019s primacy.  \n   b. The author: <quote> The training is what's crucial, not the blackness. </quote> Thus China\u2019s success \u201cdispels the myth that race has a direct relation.\u201d\n\nConclusion  \nThe only plausible explanation for China\u2019s meteoric rise in women\u2019s distance events\u2014from negligible presence to 4th-place medal ranking\u2014is the imposition of rigorous training programs and infrastructure, mirroring the article\u2019s thesis that environment and nurturing drive athletic performance. Debater_A\u2019s population-selection theory cannot account for rapid generational change or why giant nations lacking such programs fail to produce champions.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for the \u201cSelection\u2010Pool\u201d Explanation\n\n1. Large Population Enables Rare Talent Discovery  \n  a. <invalid_quote>\u201cThe pool of potential athletes has expanded \u2026 the population has exploded \u2026\u201d</invalid_quote> (Berry, \u00a77). With over a billion people, China\u2019s chance of finding exceptional runners\u2014even without radically novel training\u2014rises simply by numbers. Exceptional genetic variants for endurance (\u201cnature\u201d) become more common in larger samples.  \n  b. This mirrors how global secular trends improve performance: records fall as sample size grows, not because every individual changes. China tapped into its expanded demographic pool to produce \u201crecord\u2010breaking \u2026 female distance runners\u201d (Berry, \u00a79).\n\n2. Speed of Improvement Implies Preexisting Potential, Not Just Training  \n  a. If training alone drove world\u2010class performance, we would see gradual improvements over generations as methods diffused. Instead, China\u2019s runners appeared suddenly and dramatically in the early 1990s, jumping from near zero to fourth in medals in one Olympic cycle (Berry, \u00a79).  \n  b. This rapid ascendance is characteristic of selection of outliers, not incremental training gains.  \n\n3. Training Success Requires Talent; Selection Amplifies It  \n  a. Even the strongest training regimens can only optimize athletes within the bounds of their innate capacity. Locating individuals with superior biomechanical and physiological traits is prerequisite to world\u2010class performance.  \n  b. The fact that Kenya\u2019s distance dominance arose in rural youth accustomed to running implies environmental exposure plus innate endurance capacity. Similarly, China\u2019s program selected those with both.\n\n4. Objections to \u201cTraining\u2010Only\u201d View  \n  a. Debater_B ignores that many countries employ advanced training without comparable sudden success. If training per se were sufficient, China would have risen gradually as methods matured; instead, the dramatic leap indicates selection.  \n  b. Berry warns that environmental advantages alone cannot substitute for genetic variation: <invalid_quote>\u201cQuantitative limits\u201d like biomechanics will eventually cap performance</invalid_quote> (Berry, \u00a711). To approach those limits, one must first find outliers through selection.  \n  c. Without selection, the law of diminishing returns applies: improved shoes or nutrition \u201ctinkering\u201d yields only minuscule time savings (<quote> shave at least one-thousandth of a second </quote>, Berry, \u00a72), not Olympic\u2010medal\u2010changing performance.\n\n5. Consistency with Other Historical Examples  \n  a. Race horses are \u201cspecifically bred \u2026 generations of careful genetic selection\u201d to approach biomechanical limits (Berry, \u00a711). Their plateau suggests selection is essential for going as far as possible.  \n  b. Humans cannot be exception; China\u2019s sudden success mirrors selective breeding, albeit without controlled genetics.\n\nConclusion  \nChina\u2019s Olympic rise in women\u2019s distance events showcases the power of mining an enormous demographic and selecting those with innate superior capacities. Training merely polishes; selection finds the raw material. Thus, their program dispelled racial\u2010gene myths by showing that, when you look harder in a large population, you find world\u2010class athletes regardless of race, rather than by innovating training alone.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Starting from nothing, they dramatically improved the performance of their women distance event competitors by improving their training, to rank fourth in medals won  in the Olympics of the early 1990s.\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Direct Evidence of Rapid Improvement  \n   a. <quote>Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners (and swimmers), and, boy, did they ever. In 1992, China ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal</quote>  \n   b. This dramatic rise \u201cfrom nothing\u201d to fourth place within a single generation is only explicable by environmental intervention (training, state programs), not by genetic selection, which requires many generations to shift allele frequencies.\n\n2. Implausibility of Genetic Selection over One Generation  \n   a. Genetic change via natural or artificial (hybrid vigor) selection acts over many generations. Human generation time (~20\u201330 years) precludes major shifts in one generation.  \n   b. The text\u2019s race-horse example shows even intensive multi-generation breeding plateaus at biomechanical limits. Humans cannot genetically reinvent elite distance running overnight.\n\n3. Environmental Explanations Elsewhere in Text  \n   a. The article repeatedly attributes secular performance gains to diet, health care, and broader demographic expansion, not genetic change:  \n      \u2013 <invalid_quote>\u201cSports records would continue to tumble\u2026These minor miracles are the product neither of technology nor of training\u2026[but] demographic patterns.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n      \u2013 <quote> You are much more likely to find someone who can run a mile in 3:30 in a sample of several million superbly healthy people than you are </quote>  \n   b.

Yet Chinese women indeed shattered Asian and world records, confirming environment\u2019s primacy.  \n   b. The author: <quote> The training is what's crucial, not the blackness. </quote> Thus China\u2019s success \u201cdispels the myth that race has a direct relation.\u201d\n\nConclusion  \nThe only plausible explanation for China\u2019s meteoric rise in women\u2019s distance events\u2014from negligible presence to 4th-place medal ranking\u2014is the imposition of rigorous training programs and infrastructure, mirroring the article\u2019s thesis that environment and nurturing drive athletic performance. Debater_A\u2019s population-selection theory cannot account for rapid generational change or why giant nations lacking such programs fail to produce champions.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for the \u201cSelection\u2010Pool\u201d Explanation (Reinforced)\n\n1. Selection of Latent Talent, Not Genetic Shifts  \n  a. Debater_B conflates selection with allele\u2010frequency change: crossing a billion people to find preexisting outliers does not require new alleles or multi\u2010generation breeding. It simply \u201cmines\u201d the latent variation already present.  \n  b. <quote> You are much more likely to find someone who can run a mile in 3:30 in a sample of several million superbly healthy people than you are in a sample of 10,000. </quote> (Berry, \u00a76). China\u2019s program expanded its sample via \u201crecord-breaking\u201d trials (Berry, \u00a79).  \n  c. This is analogous to talent scouts: scouts don\u2019t \u201ccreate\u201d athletes genetically; they locate those with natural gifts and then train them.  \n\n2. Rapid, Discontinuous Leap Points to Selection of Outliers  \n  a. Debater_B\u2019s \u201ctraining\u2010only\u201d model predicts gradual diffusion of methods; instead, China went from negligible presence to 4th in one cycle. That is characteristic of uncovering \u201chidden\u201d elites, not incremental marginal gains from technology that, by Berry\u2019s account, only shave thousandths of seconds (Berry, \u00a72).  \n  b. Race\u2010horse example (Berry, \u00a711) underscores that even intensive breeding plateaus at biomechanical limits; human plateau lies much higher, so we expect selection to yield big leaps until limits loom. China\u2019s jump precedes the limit, consistent with selecting from a vastly untapped pool.\n\n3. Necessity of Talent Precedes Training  \n  a. Elite training programs can only optimize those who already possess superior biomechanics, VO2 max, and muscle\u2010fiber composition.  \n  b. Debater_B\u2019s China had the same raw material in 1896 but lacked systematic selection and modern healthcare. Only when improved health care and nutrition created a \u201csuperbly healthy\u201d demographic (Berry, \u00a76\u20137) did selection become effective.  \n  c. Once environment raised the baseline, China\u2019s selection mechanisms (Olympic trials, sports schools) instantly found the outliers.\n\n4. Debater_B\u2019s Internal Contradictions  \n  a. If environment/training alone sufficed, then nations with long\u2010standing training traditions (e.g., Japan, India) would have produced comparable leaps once they adopted modern sports science. They have not.  \n  b. Debater_B appeals to Kenyan success by environment (\u201chabit of running to school\u201d), yet Kenya\u2019s population is small relative to China\u2019s. If environment alone, China\u2019s sheer size would have guaranteed continuous presence in early Olympics. Its absence until post\u20101970s reflects lack of selection, not lack of raw potential.  \n  c. Berry explicitly emphasizes \u201cdemographic patterns\u201d (Berry, \u00a71) as the engine, not novel technologies. China simply harnessed both demographic expansion and selection programs.\n\n5. Dispelling \u201cRace\u201d Myths by Demonstrating Universality  \n  a. China\u2019s sudden dominance shows that any \u201crace\u201d can produce world\u2010class runners given sufficient selection. That is the very point of \u201cdispelling the myth\u201d (Berry, \u00a79).  \n  b. Debater_B\u2019s training\u2010only view fails to explain why China\u2019s program needed selection trials at all; casual adoption of techniques in other large nations has not yielded champions.  \n\nConclusion  \nChina\u2019s program did not \u201cevolve\u201d new genes in one generation; it scoured a massive, now\u2010healthy population for existing outliers and then applied standard training. This selection\u2010pool model explains the discontinuous surge to 4th place, parallels breeding principles (Berry, \u00a711), and fulfills the article\u2019s thesis that environment enables selection but cannot substitute for locating innate talent. Therefore, the true mechanism by which China dispelled racial\u2010genetic myths was by selection from a billion\u2010strong talent pool, not by novel training alone.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cTraining\u2010Driven Improvement\u201d (Debater_B\u2019s Position)\n\n1. China\u2019s Pre\u2010Existing Population Did Not Yield Champions  \n  a. <invalid_quote>Only 13 nations participated in 1896\u2026172 in 1992</invalid_quote> (Berry \u00a78) illustrates that large populations alone do not guarantee Olympic success. China\u2019s >1 billion people at least as great in number as many Western nations yet produced virtually no medalists until its state\u2010sponsored training program.  \n  b. If \u201cpopulation selection\u201d sufficed, China would have featured in earlier Games. Its sudden medal surge in 1992 correlates only with the launch of intensive training, not newfound genetics.\n\n2. Rapidity and Scale of Improvement Implies Environmental Effect  \n  a. <quote>the Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners (and swimmers), and, boy, did they ever. In 1992, China ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal</quote> (Berry \u00a79). This \u201cfrom nothing to fourth\u201d leap in a single generation is too fast for any genetic\u2010selection process, which requires many human generations to shift allele frequencies.  \n  b. Race\u2010horse breeding, despite \u201cgenerations of careful genetic selection\u201d (Berry \u00a711), still plateaued after a century. Humans, with longer generation times, cannot achieve parallel genetic gains overnight. Only environmental interventions\u2014training, nutrition, healthcare\u2014can deliver such rapid progress.\n\n3. Authoritative Emphasis on Training Over Natural Endowment  \n  a. The article explicitly states, <quote>The training is what's crucial, not the blackness.</quote> (Berry \u00a710). By analogy, China\u2019s success \u201cdispels the myth that race has a direct relation to athletic ability.\u201d The same logic applies to all environment\u2010driven secular trends\u2014diet, immunization, faster maturation (Berry \u00a7\u00a74\u20136).  \n  b. The text predicts continued record\u2010breaking as long as \u201cthese long-term trends [in environment]\u201d persist (Berry \u00a712). China simply amplified global secular improvements with focused programs.\n\n4. Selection of Outliers Requires Training to Manifest Performance  \n  a. Even if genetic variation (\u201chybrid vigor\u201d) exists (Berry \u00a79), untapped potential remains latent without proper development. China\u2019s program provided the \u201csample\u2026of several million superbly healthy people\u201d plus training facilities needed to actualize talent (Berry \u00a76).  \n  b. Kenya and Ethiopia likewise combine demographic potential with lifestyle/training (habitual long\u2010distance running) to yield champions. Pure population size without training has never produced distance\u2010running domination.\n\n5. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cPool\u2010Only\u201d Theory Contradicts Textual Evidence  \n  a. Debater_A ignores that secular demographic expansion has not uniformly produced champions in all large\u2010population regions; performance gains trace to improvements in healthcare and nutrition over decades, not sudden medal\u2010winning leaps.  \n  b. <invalid_quote>Sports records would continue to tumble even if training methods\u2026were exactly the same today as they were in 1896</invalid_quote> (Berry \u00a72) is meant as a reductio: without secular demographic changes, not without training. Debater_A conflates \u201ctechnology\u201d with \u201cenvironment\u201d\u2014the article contrasts minor \u201ctinkering\u201d (shaving thousandths of a second) with major demographic effects that require sustained development programs.\n\nConclusion  \nChina\u2019s meteoric rise in women\u2019s distance running, from near invisibility to fourth\u2010place Olympic ranking within one generation, is only explicable by intensive, state-sponsored training and environmental enhancements. Genetic or population\u2010size arguments fail to account for (1) China\u2019s earlier absence, (2) the rapidity of the ascent, (3) the plateau in genetically selected race horses, and (4) the author\u2019s own assertion that \u201ctraining is crucial.\u201d Therefore, China\u2019s achievements best demonstrate that nurture, not innate genetic selection, dispelled the racial\u2010difference myth in racing speed.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision. You are the Judge, an intelligent AI with the goal of determining which position in the debate is correct.\n  - Remember that Debater_A is defending the position that \"The Chinese conducted extremely effective selection events. With a billion people, they were well-positioned to find more good runners if they just looked.\" while Debater_B is defending the position that \"Starting from nothing, they dramatically improved the performance of their women distance event competitors by improving their training, to rank fourth in medals won  in the Olympics of the early 1990s.\".\n  - You must make a decision, as it is important for the successful completion of this educational exercise.\n  - When giving your answer, you should also specify how confident you are in that position on a scale from 50% (completely unsure) to 100% (completely certain)\n\nPlease give your answer exclusively in this format: [DEBATER_NAME] [CONFIDENCE]\n  - Example 1 - Debater_A | 91%\n  - Example 2: Debater_B | 63%\n  - Do not contain any other text at all.\n\nNow give your answer:\n",
