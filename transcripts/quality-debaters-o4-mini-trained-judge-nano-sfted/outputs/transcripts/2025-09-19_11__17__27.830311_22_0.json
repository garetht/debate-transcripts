Philadelphia's Shibe Park, home to the Athletics and later the Phillies, was one of 13 urban ballparks built in the seven-year period now regarded as the golden age of ballpark architecture. All but three (Wrigley Field, Fenway Park, and Tiger Stadium) have since been razed. \n\n          Replacing parks built of wood, these ballyards set new standards for size, fire safety, intimacy, and convenience. As places to watch ballgames, they were vastly superior to the post-World War II parks, especially the facilities designed in the late '60s and '70s that doubled as football stadiums. But these concrete monsters, plopped into vast parking lots in Houston, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, and elsewhere, lack the character of the classic parks. \n\n         Chicago's New Comiskey Park, which opened in 1991, attempted to address the character question with a superficial postmodern facade that in some ways resembled the exterior of the golden-era park it replaced. New Comiskey was marketed as an old-fashioned park with all the modern conveniences. But inside, it was still a symmetrical concrete monster, and it sat in the middle of a 7,000-car parking lot rather than in an urban neighborhood. \n\n         A year later, a new--yet more genuinely old--ballpark arrived to dispel the gloom. Baltimore's Oriole Park at Camden Yards revived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical, relatively intimate, steel-structured, city-friendly ballpark. \"Once this opens,\" predicted Commissioner of Baseball Bart Giamatti, \"everyone will want one like it.\" And so it came to be: Camden Yards' successors in Cleveland, Arlington (Texas), and Denver, and those designed for Milwaukee, Seattle, and San Francisco, take their cues from Baltimore's conceptual breakthrough. Even totally nontraditional parks, like those in Phoenix, Miami, and Tampa Bay, emulate the asymmetry of the Camden Yards outfield. It's almost as though a disembodied voice intoned, \"If you build it, they will copy.\" \n\n         While Camden Yards and its offspring are almost universally praised, some of them don't deserve the hype. The most annoying hype is that all the new parks are intimate, and that every seat is better at the new place than the old. Intimacy has two aspects--actual size and the subjective perception of size and scale. A good architect can ace the second part of the test through convincing forms, good proportions, and attractive materials. The exposed steelwork, brick, stone, tile, and well-placed wall openings of the new parks beat the cold and sterile stadiums of a generation ago. \n\n         For the new parks' charms, we should be thankful. But in actual size, the new ballyards are not intimate. All their amenities--elevators, wider concourses, abundant toilets (especially for women), bathrooms, escalators, plentiful food stands, and luxury suites--make them far larger than the parks they claim to emulate. These parks are larger than even the multipurpose hulks we all love to hate. Compare, for instance, the spanking new Ballpark at Arlington (49,100 seats), which rests on 13.6 acres, to Seattle's Kingdome, a 58,000-seat multipurpose stadium that opened in 1976 and covers 9.3 acres. (Ebbets Field, home to the Brooklyn Dodgers, occupied a mere 5.7 acres and seated 32,000.) \n\n         Or compare heights: New Comiskey Park's roof is 146 feet above field level; old Comiskey Park was about 75 feet high. This is not ballpark trivia, but an indicator of fan experience: Upper-deck seats in the new, taller stadiums are farther away from the action. At Arlington, the fan sitting in the middle-row, upper-deck seat closest to home plate is 224 feet from the batter, compared to 125 feet at Tiger Stadium, a park with 4,300 more seats. \n\n         Why are upper-deck seats in the new parks so far from the game? Two reasons: column placement and luxury seating. \n\n         In the old parks, the structural columns stood within the seating areas, placing the upper-deck seats closer to the game. The trade-off was that these columns obstructed the view of some fans. Today's architects \"remedy\" the problem by placing the columns behind the seating areas, thus moving the upper decks back from the field. (It should be noted that the new parks' claim that they have no impaired-view seats is an overstatement.) \n\n         Added tiers devoted to luxury seating at the new parks also push the upper deck away from the field. The retreat of that deck is a century-long process, but it can be stemmed. The Orioles pressed for several design changes that lowered Camden Yards' top deck and produced a middle-row viewing distance of 199 feet, about eight rows closer than Arlington's. \n\n         Design references to golden-age ballparks are only one parallel between that period and ours. We are also matching that era's frenzied pace of construction: Twenty-six of Major League Baseball's 32 franchises occupy a park that is less than 10 years old; has been, or will be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move into a new one soon. \n\n         One of the classic parks' merits was that they were unsubsidized. Team owners bought land and paid for stadium construction--some even built trolley lines to transport fans to the games. In all but two cases during the last 65 years, taxpayers have covered most or all of the costs of stadium building. \n\n         The San Francisco Giants are planning a similar arrangement for their bayfront stadium, assembling about $240 million in private funds and persuading the city to pay for some of the infrastructure. The Giants say that other team owners are rooting against their scheme, because it calls into question the profligate public subsidies. Some of the subsidies exceed capital and maintenance costs: If the White Sox fail to draw 1.5 million annual fans at New Comiskey Park in the 11th through 20th years of their lease, the state of Illinois is contractually obliged to cover the shortfall at the gate by buying upto 300,000 tickets. \n\n         You'd expect that the public would get something, perhaps affordable seats, in return for subsidizing stadiums. Instead, the cheap seats in the new parks are scarcer. The Seattle Mariners' proposed park, for instance, will contain about one-fourth as many general-admission seats as the present location. This erosion of low-cost seats is a long-running trend. \n\n         So too is the dramatic increase in luxury seating, which is the primary real reason for the ballpark-building boom. The real gold mines are the posh luxury suites that lease for between $30,000 and $200,000 a year (payable in advance). A comparable moneymaker is the club deck, just above the first-tier seating. These pricey sections are occupied usually on a season-ticket basis, and offer the best sightlines, roomier seats, and wait staff who peddle gourmet fare. \n\n         The gilding doesn't end there: New parks also include members-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants. \n\n          Naturally, owners don't advertise their new parks as a means of making life better for elite ticketholders. They say that only a new stadium will allow them to make enough money to stay in town or to field a competitive team and to allow fans to savor that old-time baseball flavor in greater comfort and convenience. Local taxpayers tend to lay off this pitch--they have voted these measures down in Illinois, Washington state, California, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Politically savvy owners usually bypass the voters and tap state governments directly for the money. \n\n         Larger and more lavish stadiums translate into greater land and construction costs. Operable roofs, such as those in Toronto's SkyDome, Phoenix's BankOne Ballpark, and those proposed for Seattle and Milwaukee, are budget-busters. Since most teams put up little (if any) of their own money, they have scant incentive to economize on the parks. In Seattle, Mariner management has demanded an operable roof even though the city has the driest weather in MLB outside California. The real problem with the Seattle climate is cold weather in spring and fall, but the unsealed roof won't make the park warmer or totally free of wind. \n\n         Lately, the cost of stadiums has ranged from about $300 million to $500 million. The multipurpose stadium that the Yankees want built on Manhattan's lower west side tentatively carries a $1 billion price tag. Add the financing and maintenance costs, and even a midpriced project goes through the retractable roof. At one point, the cost of the Brewers' proposed stadium grew from $250 million to $845 million, and that's not counting the value of the land. \n\n         The good news is that not every owner is demanding a castle for his team. All Pittsburgh Pirates owner Kevin McClatchy wants is a \"35,000-to-37,000-seat park with natural grass and no roof, bells, or whistles.\" Though his attitude is commendable, the proposed park will still cost about $200 million, and perhaps an equal amount in interest. \n\n         Why should the public chip in? Taxpayer subsidies don't produce cheaper tickets--they produce more expensive tickets. The average admission price (not counting club seats and suites) rises about 35 percent when a team moves into new digs. And independent economists (i.e., those not hired by stadium proponents) discount the claim that new stadiums spur regional economic growth. \n\n         But one compelling argument for subsidies is that new stadiums can pull their cities together when properly designed and sited. This requires a downtown or neighborhood location where lots of fans can take the bus or the train to the game; where they can walk to the stadium from work, hotels, restaurants, or bars; and where getting to the game is a communal event that is part of a broader urban experience. This is the case with older parks such as Wrigley Field and Fenway Park, and the new ones in Toronto, Baltimore, Cleveland, and Denver. \n\n         \"If you put them in the wrong place, it's a colossal waste of money,\" says the planning director of the city of Cleveland. \"But if you put them in the right place, the benefits are phenomenal,\" \n\n         Recent attendance patterns show that urban parks generate much better patronage than suburban ones or those in neither/nor locations. There are also strong indicators that suggest new urban parks have \"legs,\" retaining more of their patrons after the novelty wears off. But some teams deliberately seek isolated locations, where they can better monopolize parking revenues and game-related food, drink, and souvenir business. This is why the White Sox moated their park with 100 acres of parking, why the Milwaukee Brewers refuse to build downtown, and why the Mariners insisted on the most remote of Seattle's three ballpark-siting options. \n\n         Modern conveniences aside, the new baseball shrines are a mixed bag. Most are visually impressive, boast interestingly shaped playing fields, and start off as box-office hits. But too many of them are large and expensive, tend to live on the dole, and are hampered by seat layouts that create a caste system among fans. At their best, they strengthen their cities; at their worst, they exploit them. \n\n         The decision-making process behind the financing and building of new ballparks has become predictable, as have the designs. But the good news is that our stadium boom is far from over. If owners and public agencies can be persuaded to take a longer view of stadium economics and community concerns, we may yet see parks that better unite traditional character with modern convenience.\n", "question": "What are some of the design features that the author highlights as beneficial about the new park designs?", "first_debater_answer": "There is a greater diversity of dining", "second_debater_answer": "The fields have new shapes", "debate_identifier": "Diamonds in the Rough_What are some of the design features that the author highlights as beneficial about the new park designs?"}, "speeches": [{"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "The following are rules from the game of Debate.\n- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_A, Debater_B) and a Judge.

Operable roofs, such as those in Toronto's SkyDome, Phoenix's BankOne Ballpark, and those proposed for Seattle and Milwaukee, are budget-busters.

In Seattle, Mariner management has demanded an operable roof even though the city has the driest weather in MLB outside California. The real problem with the Seattle climate is cold weather in spring and fall, but the unsealed roof won't make the park warmer or totally free of wind. \n\n         Lately, the cost of stadiums has ranged from about $300 million to $500 million.

All Pittsburgh Pirates owner Kevin McClatchy wants is a \"35,000-to-37,000-seat park with natural grass and no roof, bells, or whistles.\" Though his attitude is commendable, the proposed park will still cost about $200 million, and perhaps an equal amount in interest. \n\n         Why should the public chip in?

This requires a downtown or neighborhood location where lots of fans can take the bus or the train to the game; where they can walk to the stadium from work, hotels, restaurants, or bars; and where getting to the game is a communal event that is part of a broader urban experience.

Philadelphia's Shibe Park, home to the Athletics and later the Phillies, was one of 13 urban ballparks built in the seven-year period now regarded as the golden age of ballpark architecture. All but three (Wrigley Field, Fenway Park, and Tiger Stadium) have since been razed. \n\n          Replacing parks built of wood, these ballyards set new standards for size, fire safety, intimacy, and convenience. As places to watch ballgames, they were vastly superior to the post-World War II parks, especially the facilities designed in the late '60s and '70s that doubled as football stadiums. But these concrete monsters, plopped into vast parking lots in Houston, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, and elsewhere, lack the character of the classic parks. \n\n         Chicago's New Comiskey Park, which opened in 1991, attempted to address the character question with a superficial postmodern facade that in some ways resembled the exterior of the golden-era park it replaced. New Comiskey was marketed as an old-fashioned park with all the modern conveniences. But inside, it was still a symmetrical concrete monster, and it sat in the middle of a 7,000-car parking lot rather than in an urban neighborhood. \n\n         A year later, a new--yet more genuinely old--ballpark arrived to dispel the gloom. Baltimore's Oriole Park at Camden Yards revived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical, relatively intimate, steel-structured, city-friendly ballpark. \"Once this opens,\" predicted Commissioner of Baseball Bart Giamatti, \"everyone will want one like it.\" And so it came to be: Camden Yards' successors in Cleveland, Arlington (Texas), and Denver, and those designed for Milwaukee, Seattle, and San Francisco, take their cues from Baltimore's conceptual breakthrough. Even totally nontraditional parks, like those in Phoenix, Miami, and Tampa Bay, emulate the asymmetry of the Camden Yards outfield. It's almost as though a disembodied voice intoned, \"If you build it, they will copy.\" \n\n         While Camden Yards and its offspring are almost universally praised, some of them don't deserve the hype. The most annoying hype is that all the new parks are intimate, and that every seat is better at the new place than the old. Intimacy has two aspects--actual size and the subjective perception of size and scale. A good architect can ace the second part of the test through convincing forms, good proportions, and attractive materials. The exposed steelwork, brick, stone, tile, and well-placed wall openings of the new parks beat the cold and sterile stadiums of a generation ago. \n\n         For the new parks' charms, we should be thankful. But in actual size, the new ballyards are not intimate. All their amenities--elevators, wider concourses, abundant toilets (especially for women), bathrooms, escalators, plentiful food stands, and luxury suites--make them far larger than the parks they claim to emulate. These parks are larger than even the multipurpose hulks we all love to hate. Compare, for instance, the spanking new Ballpark at Arlington (49,100 seats), which rests on 13.6 acres, to Seattle's Kingdome, a 58,000-seat multipurpose stadium that opened in 1976 and covers 9.3 acres. (Ebbets Field, home to the Brooklyn Dodgers, occupied a mere 5.7 acres and seated 32,000.) \n\n         Or compare heights: New Comiskey Park's roof is 146 feet above field level; old Comiskey Park was about 75 feet high. This is not ballpark trivia, but an indicator of fan experience: Upper-deck seats in the new, taller stadiums are farther away from the action. At Arlington, the fan sitting in the middle-row, upper-deck seat closest to home plate is 224 feet from the batter, compared to 125 feet at Tiger Stadium, a park with 4,300 more seats. \n\n         Why are upper-deck seats in the new parks so far from the game? Two reasons: column placement and luxury seating. \n\n         In the old parks, the structural columns stood within the seating areas, placing the upper-deck seats closer to the game. The trade-off was that these columns obstructed the view of some fans. Today's architects \"remedy\" the problem by placing the columns behind the seating areas, thus moving the upper decks back from the field. (It should be noted that the new parks' claim that they have no impaired-view seats is an overstatement.) \n\n         Added tiers devoted to luxury seating at the new parks also push the upper deck away from the field. The retreat of that deck is a century-long process, but it can be stemmed. The Orioles pressed for several design changes that lowered Camden Yards' top deck and produced a middle-row viewing distance of 199 feet, about eight rows closer than Arlington's. \n\n         Design references to golden-age ballparks are only one parallel between that period and ours. We are also matching that era's frenzied pace of construction: Twenty-six of Major League Baseball's 32 franchises occupy a park that is less than 10 years old; has been, or will be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move into a new one soon. \n\n         One of the classic parks' merits was that they were unsubsidized. Team owners bought land and paid for stadium construction--some even built trolley lines to transport fans to the games. In all but two cases during the last 65 years, taxpayers have covered most or all of the costs of stadium building. \n\n         The San Francisco Giants are planning a similar arrangement for their bayfront stadium, assembling about $240 million in private funds and persuading the city to pay for some of the infrastructure. The Giants say that other team owners are rooting against their scheme, because it calls into question the profligate public subsidies. Some of the subsidies exceed capital and maintenance costs: If the White Sox fail to draw 1.5 million annual fans at New Comiskey Park in the 11th through 20th years of their lease, the state of Illinois is contractually obliged to cover the shortfall at the gate by buying upto 300,000 tickets. \n\n         You'd expect that the public would get something, perhaps affordable seats, in return for subsidizing stadiums. Instead, the cheap seats in the new parks are scarcer. The Seattle Mariners' proposed park, for instance, will contain about one-fourth as many general-admission seats as the present location. This erosion of low-cost seats is a long-running trend. \n\n         So too is the dramatic increase in luxury seating, which is the primary real reason for the ballpark-building boom. The real gold mines are the posh luxury suites that lease for between $30,000 and $200,000 a year (payable in advance). A comparable moneymaker is the club deck, just above the first-tier seating. These pricey sections are occupied usually on a season-ticket basis, and offer the best sightlines, roomier seats, and wait staff who peddle gourmet fare. \n\n         The gilding doesn't end there: New parks also include members-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants. \n\n          Naturally, owners don't advertise their new parks as a means of making life better for elite ticketholders. They say that only a new stadium will allow them to make enough money to stay in town or to field a competitive team and to allow fans to savor that old-time baseball flavor in greater comfort and convenience. Local taxpayers tend to lay off this pitch--they have voted these measures down in Illinois, Washington state, California, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Politically savvy owners usually bypass the voters and tap state governments directly for the money. \n\n         Larger and more lavish stadiums translate into greater land and construction costs. Operable roofs, such as those in Toronto's SkyDome, Phoenix's BankOne Ballpark, and those proposed for Seattle and Milwaukee, are budget-busters. Since most teams put up little (if any) of their own money, they have scant incentive to economize on the parks. In Seattle, Mariner management has demanded an operable roof even though the city has the driest weather in MLB outside California. The real problem with the Seattle climate is cold weather in spring and fall, but the unsealed roof won't make the park warmer or totally free of wind. \n\n         Lately, the cost of stadiums has ranged from about $300 million to $500 million. The multipurpose stadium that the Yankees want built on Manhattan's lower west side tentatively carries a $1 billion price tag. Add the financing and maintenance costs, and even a midpriced project goes through the retractable roof. At one point, the cost of the Brewers' proposed stadium grew from $250 million to $845 million, and that's not counting the value of the land. \n\n         The good news is that not every owner is demanding a castle for his team.

And independent economists (i.e., those not hired by stadium proponents) discount the claim that new stadiums spur regional economic growth. \n\n         But one compelling argument for subsidies is that new stadiums can pull their cities together when properly designed and sited. This requires a downtown or neighborhood location where lots of fans can take the bus or the train to the game; where they can walk to the stadium from work, hotels, restaurants, or bars; and where getting to the game is a communal event that is part of a broader urban experience. This is the case with older parks such as Wrigley Field and Fenway Park, and the new ones in Toronto, Baltimore, Cleveland, and Denver. \n\n         \"If you put them in the wrong place, it's a colossal waste of money,\" says the planning director of the city of Cleveland. \"But if you put them in the right place, the benefits are phenomenal,\" \n\n         Recent attendance patterns show that urban parks generate much better patronage than suburban ones or those in neither/nor locations.

Philadelphia's Shibe Park, home to the Athletics and later the Phillies, was one of 13 urban ballparks built in the seven-year period now regarded as the golden age of ballpark architecture. All but three (Wrigley Field, Fenway Park, and Tiger Stadium) have since been razed. \n\n          Replacing parks built of wood, these ballyards set new standards for size, fire safety, intimacy, and convenience. As places to watch ballgames, they were vastly superior to the post-World War II parks, especially the facilities designed in the late '60s and '70s that doubled as football stadiums. But these concrete monsters, plopped into vast parking lots in Houston, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, and elsewhere, lack the character of the classic parks. \n\n         Chicago's New Comiskey Park, which opened in 1991, attempted to address the character question with a superficial postmodern facade that in some ways resembled the exterior of the golden-era park it replaced. New Comiskey was marketed as an old-fashioned park with all the modern conveniences. But inside, it was still a symmetrical concrete monster, and it sat in the middle of a 7,000-car parking lot rather than in an urban neighborhood. \n\n         A year later, a new--yet more genuinely old--ballpark arrived to dispel the gloom. Baltimore's Oriole Park at Camden Yards revived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical, relatively intimate, steel-structured, city-friendly ballpark. \"Once this opens,\" predicted Commissioner of Baseball Bart Giamatti, \"everyone will want one like it.\" And so it came to be: Camden Yards' successors in Cleveland, Arlington (Texas), and Denver, and those designed for Milwaukee, Seattle, and San Francisco, take their cues from Baltimore's conceptual breakthrough. Even totally nontraditional parks, like those in Phoenix, Miami, and Tampa Bay, emulate the asymmetry of the Camden Yards outfield. It's almost as though a disembodied voice intoned, \"If you build it, they will copy.\" \n\n         While Camden Yards and its offspring are almost universally praised, some of them don't deserve the hype. The most annoying hype is that all the new parks are intimate, and that every seat is better at the new place than the old. Intimacy has two aspects--actual size and the subjective perception of size and scale. A good architect can ace the second part of the test through convincing forms, good proportions, and attractive materials. The exposed steelwork, brick, stone, tile, and well-placed wall openings of the new parks beat the cold and sterile stadiums of a generation ago. \n\n         For the new parks' charms, we should be thankful. But in actual size, the new ballyards are not intimate. All their amenities--elevators, wider concourses, abundant toilets (especially for women), bathrooms, escalators, plentiful food stands, and luxury suites--make them far larger than the parks they claim to emulate. These parks are larger than even the multipurpose hulks we all love to hate. Compare, for instance, the spanking new Ballpark at Arlington (49,100 seats), which rests on 13.6 acres, to Seattle's Kingdome, a 58,000-seat multipurpose stadium that opened in 1976 and covers 9.3 acres. (Ebbets Field, home to the Brooklyn Dodgers, occupied a mere 5.7 acres and seated 32,000.) \n\n         Or compare heights: New Comiskey Park's roof is 146 feet above field level; old Comiskey Park was about 75 feet high. This is not ballpark trivia, but an indicator of fan experience: Upper-deck seats in the new, taller stadiums are farther away from the action. At Arlington, the fan sitting in the middle-row, upper-deck seat closest to home plate is 224 feet from the batter, compared to 125 feet at Tiger Stadium, a park with 4,300 more seats. \n\n         Why are upper-deck seats in the new parks so far from the game? Two reasons: column placement and luxury seating. \n\n         In the old parks, the structural columns stood within the seating areas, placing the upper-deck seats closer to the game. The trade-off was that these columns obstructed the view of some fans. Today's architects \"remedy\" the problem by placing the columns behind the seating areas, thus moving the upper decks back from the field. (It should be noted that the new parks' claim that they have no impaired-view seats is an overstatement.) \n\n         Added tiers devoted to luxury seating at the new parks also push the upper deck away from the field. The retreat of that deck is a century-long process, but it can be stemmed. The Orioles pressed for several design changes that lowered Camden Yards' top deck and produced a middle-row viewing distance of 199 feet, about eight rows closer than Arlington's. \n\n         Design references to golden-age ballparks are only one parallel between that period and ours. We are also matching that era's frenzied pace of construction: Twenty-six of Major League Baseball's 32 franchises occupy a park that is less than 10 years old; has been, or will be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move into a new one soon. \n\n         One of the classic parks' merits was that they were unsubsidized. Team owners bought land and paid for stadium construction--some even built trolley lines to transport fans to the games. In all but two cases during the last 65 years, taxpayers have covered most or all of the costs of stadium building. \n\n         The San Francisco Giants are planning a similar arrangement for their bayfront stadium, assembling about $240 million in private funds and persuading the city to pay for some of the infrastructure. The Giants say that other team owners are rooting against their scheme, because it calls into question the profligate public subsidies. Some of the subsidies exceed capital and maintenance costs: If the White Sox fail to draw 1.5 million annual fans at New Comiskey Park in the 11th through 20th years of their lease, the state of Illinois is contractually obliged to cover the shortfall at the gate by buying upto 300,000 tickets. \n\n         You'd expect that the public would get something, perhaps affordable seats, in return for subsidizing stadiums. Instead, the cheap seats in the new parks are scarcer. The Seattle Mariners' proposed park, for instance, will contain about one-fourth as many general-admission seats as the present location. This erosion of low-cost seats is a long-running trend. \n\n         So too is the dramatic increase in luxury seating, which is the primary real reason for the ballpark-building boom. The real gold mines are the posh luxury suites that lease for between $30,000 and $200,000 a year (payable in advance). A comparable moneymaker is the club deck, just above the first-tier seating. These pricey sections are occupied usually on a season-ticket basis, and offer the best sightlines, roomier seats, and wait staff who peddle gourmet fare. \n\n         The gilding doesn't end there: New parks also include members-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants. \n\n          Naturally, owners don't advertise their new parks as a means of making life better for elite ticketholders. They say that only a new stadium will allow them to make enough money to stay in town or to field a competitive team and to allow fans to savor that old-time baseball flavor in greater comfort and convenience. Local taxpayers tend to lay off this pitch--they have voted these measures down in Illinois, Washington state, California, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Politically savvy owners usually bypass the voters and tap state governments directly for the money. \n\n         Larger and more lavish stadiums translate into greater land and construction costs. Operable roofs, such as those in Toronto's SkyDome, Phoenix's BankOne Ballpark, and those proposed for Seattle and Milwaukee, are budget-busters. Since most teams put up little (if any) of their own money, they have scant incentive to economize on the parks. In Seattle, Mariner management has demanded an operable roof even though the city has the driest weather in MLB outside California. The real problem with the Seattle climate is cold weather in spring and fall, but the unsealed roof won't make the park warmer or totally free of wind. \n\n         Lately, the cost of stadiums has ranged from about $300 million to $500 million. The multipurpose stadium that the Yankees want built on Manhattan's lower west side tentatively carries a $1 billion price tag. Add the financing and maintenance costs, and even a midpriced project goes through the retractable roof. At one point, the cost of the Brewers' proposed stadium grew from $250 million to $845 million, and that's not counting the value of the land. \n\n         The good news is that not every owner is demanding a castle for his team. All Pittsburgh Pirates owner Kevin McClatchy wants is a \"35,000-to-37,000-seat park with natural grass and no roof, bells, or whistles.\" Though his attitude is commendable, the proposed park will still cost about $200 million, and perhaps an equal amount in interest. \n\n         Why should the public chip in? Taxpayer subsidies don't produce cheaper tickets--they produce more expensive tickets. The average admission price (not counting club seats and suites) rises about 35 percent when a team moves into new digs. And independent economists (i.e., those not hired by stadium proponents) discount the claim that new stadiums spur regional economic growth. \n\n         But one compelling argument for subsidies is that new stadiums can pull their cities together when properly designed and sited. This requires a downtown or neighborhood location where lots of fans can take the bus or the train to the game; where they can walk to the stadium from work, hotels, restaurants, or bars; and where getting to the game is a communal event that is part of a broader urban experience. This is the case with older parks such as Wrigley Field and Fenway Park, and the new ones in Toronto, Baltimore, Cleveland, and Denver. \n\n         \"If you put them in the wrong place, it's a colossal waste of money,\" says the planning director of the city of Cleveland. \"But if you put them in the right place, the benefits are phenomenal,\" \n\n         Recent attendance patterns show that urban parks generate much better patronage than suburban ones or those in neither/nor locations. There are also strong indicators that suggest new urban parks have \"legs,\" retaining more of their patrons after the novelty wears off. But some teams deliberately seek isolated locations, where they can better monopolize parking revenues and game-related food, drink, and souvenir business. This is why the White Sox moated their park with 100 acres of parking, why the Milwaukee Brewers refuse to build downtown, and why the Mariners insisted on the most remote of Seattle's three ballpark-siting options. \n\n         Modern conveniences aside, the new baseball shrines are a mixed bag. Most are visually impressive, boast interestingly shaped playing fields, and start off as box-office hits. But too many of them are large and expensive, tend to live on the dole, and are hampered by seat layouts that create a caste system among fans. At their best, they strengthen their cities; at their worst, they exploit them. \n\n         The decision-making process behind the financing and building of new ballparks has become predictable, as have the designs. But the good news is that our stadium boom is far from over. If owners and public agencies can be persuaded to take a longer view of stadium economics and community concerns, we may yet see parks that better unite traditional character with modern convenience.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat are some of the design features that the author highlights as beneficial about the new park designs?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The fields have new shapes\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"There is a greater diversity of dining\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"There is a greater diversity of dining\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cGreater Diversity of Dining\u201d  \n1.

Dining diversity enhances subjective intimacy and community  \n   a. Author notes \u201cgood proportions, attractive materials\u201d and \u201cwell-placed wall openings\u201d improve ambiance; these only matter if fans linger for dining and socializing.  \n   b. Urban siting \u201cwhere they can walk to the stadium from\u2026 restaurants, or bars\u201d (<quote> where they can walk to the stadium from work, hotels, restaurants, or bars;</quote>) turns games into a communal event that extends into diverse pre- and post-game dining.  \n3. Revenue motive aligns with dining emphasis  \n   a. \u201cThe real gold mines are the posh luxury suites\u2026 club deck\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cclub deck\u2026 wait staff\u2026 gourmet fare\u201d</invalid_quote>) \u2013 these are high-margin dining experiences.  \n   b.

Dining supports competitive advantage and fan retention  \n   a. \u201cNew urban parks have \u2018legs\u2019\u201d \u2013 part of staying power is offering diverse concessions and bars, making repeat visits attractive even after novelty wears off.  \n   b. Expanded concourses and amenities (elevators, wider concourses) are justified by traffic to varied dining venues throughout the ballpark.  \n\nRebuttal of \u201cNew Field Shapes\u201d Argument  \n1. Asymmetry is aesthetic, not a broad design feature  \n   a. Author\u2019s praise: \u201cconceptual breakthrough\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cquirkily asymmetrical\u2026 city-friendly ballpark\u201d</invalid_quote>) but quickly notes \u201csome\u2026 don\u2019t deserve the hype\u201d and that size still defeats intimacy. Asymmetry alone fails to solve fundamental problems of distance and scale.  \n   b. Asymmetry is imitated because it is novel, not because it improves fan experience beyond visuals. Fans cannot taste or spend time at field edges.  \n2. No link to amenities or revenue  \n   a. Field shape generates no ancillary revenue, unlike dining, luxury suites, or clubs. Authors repeatedly discuss subsidies and financing driven by revenue from food and drink, not by unique field contours.  \n   b. The author\u2019s concern over cost overruns (operable roofs, parking) would be unnecessary if field shape were the primary driver; instead, owners push lavish dining and luxury to justify public subsidies.  \n3. Dining diversity directly addresses author\u2019s call for urban integration  \n   a. Urban siting and communal walking emphasize the social/dining aspect of attendance. Field shape offers no reason for fans to visit nearby bars or restaurants before or after the game.  \n   b. Dining diversity leverages the city environment; field shape exists only within the stadium and cannot foster urban economic growth as the author advocates.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe author repeatedly emphasizes modern amenities\u2014particularly varied, upscale dining options\u2014as critical design achievements that blend \u201cold-time baseball flavor\u201d with modern convenience, drive revenue, sustain attendance, and integrate stadiums into urban life. Field shape is secondary, aesthetic-only, lacks the functional and economic importance that dining diversity provides. Thus, \u201cgreater diversity of dining\u201d is the correct answer.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cThe fields have new shapes\u201d (Debater_B)\n\nI. New field shapes are repeatedly lauded as the signature design breakthrough and directly correlated with the parks\u2019 success  \n  1. <invalid_quote>\u201cBaltimore\u2019s Oriole Park at Camden Yards revived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical\u2026city-friendly ballpark.\u201d</invalid_quote> (\u00b64)  \n     \u2013 Commissioner Giamatti predicted immediate emulation.  \n     \u2013 Successive parks in Cleveland, Arlington, Denver, Milwaukee, Seattle, San Francisco, Phoenix, Miami, Tampa Bay \u201ctake their cues\u201d or \u201cemulate the asymmetry\u201d (\u00b64).  \n  2. Universal praise for new parks stems from their distinctive playing-field geometry, not merely from food or luxury amenities (\u00b65).  \n     \u2013 Even \u201ctotally nontraditional parks\u2026emulate the asymmetry\u201d solely for the field design benefit.  \n  3. Asymmetrical outfields and \u201cinteresting shaped playing fields\u201d are cited as visual and experiential improvements (\u00b619).  \n     \u2013 Fans respond to unique dimensions and sightlines.  \n     \u2013 These shapes restore intimacy via \u201cgood proportions\u201d and \u201cconvincing forms\u201d (\u00b65), enhancing the spectator experience.  \n\nII. New field shapes achieve the desired \u201cintimacy\u201d while preserving modern amenities  \n  1. Subjective perception of size and scale depends largely on the field\u2019s geometry and proximity; asymmetry creates a sense of enclosure and closeness (\u00b65).  \n     \u2013 Field shape works in tandem with lower decks; Orioles further \u201clowered Camden Yards\u2019 top deck\u201d to get seats \u201cabout eight rows closer than Arlington\u2019s\u201d (\u00b68).  \n  2. Innovative column placement (behind seating) is only feasible thanks to the structural flexibility allowed by steel frameworks and asymmetrical shapes (\u00b69).  \n     \u2013 This trade-off is only acceptable because the field shapes themselves improve sightlines so much that \u201cno impaired-view seats\u201d is at least claimed (\u00b69).  \n\nIII. Attacking \u201cGreater diversity of dining\u201d as the correct answer  \n  1. Dining and concessions are generic to all modern stadiums, including multipurpose \u201cconcrete monsters\u201d of the \u201970s (\u00b62\u20133).  \n     \u2013 The author acknowledges \u201cabundant food stands\u201d and \u201cgourmet fare\u201d (\u00b65, \u00b614) simply as necessary amenities for size, not as defining design innovations.  \n     \u2013 Multipurpose hulks also include concessions; yet they are criticized for lack of character and intimacy (\u00b62).  \n  2. The question asks for \u201cdesign features\u2026about the new park designs,\u201d which refers to architectural and spatial innovations, not merely food or bars (\u00b619).  \n  3. Dining improvements do not require the \u201cquirkily asymmetrical\u201d layouts, the steel-and-brick fa\u00e7ades, or urban siting that are repeatedly highlighted as the parks\u2019 conceptual breakthroughs (\u00b64, \u00b618).  \n\nIV. Conclusion  \n  1. Only the asymmetrical, novel field shapes are universally emulated and praised as the conceptual breakthrough that defines the \u201cnew park designs.\u201d  \n  2. Dining variety, while present, is incidental to the architectural character, intimacy, and fan experience improvements that the author repeatedly credits to innovative field geometry.  \n  3. Therefore, \u201cThe fields have new shapes\u201d is the correct and complete answer.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"There is a greater diversity of dining\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "I.

Philadelphia's Shibe Park, home to the Athletics and later the Phillies, was one of 13 urban ballparks built in the seven-year period now regarded as the golden age of ballpark architecture. All but three (Wrigley Field, Fenway Park, and Tiger Stadium) have since been razed. \n\n          Replacing parks built of wood, these ballyards set new standards for size, fire safety, intimacy, and convenience. As places to watch ballgames, they were vastly superior to the post-World War II parks, especially the facilities designed in the late '60s and '70s that doubled as football stadiums. But these concrete monsters, plopped into vast parking lots in Houston, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, and elsewhere, lack the character of the classic parks. \n\n         Chicago's New Comiskey Park, which opened in 1991, attempted to address the character question with a superficial postmodern facade that in some ways resembled the exterior of the golden-era park it replaced. New Comiskey was marketed as an old-fashioned park with all the modern conveniences. But inside, it was still a symmetrical concrete monster, and it sat in the middle of a 7,000-car parking lot rather than in an urban neighborhood. \n\n         A year later, a new--yet more genuinely old--ballpark arrived to dispel the gloom. Baltimore's Oriole Park at Camden Yards revived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical, relatively intimate, steel-structured, city-friendly ballpark. \"Once this opens,\" predicted Commissioner of Baseball Bart Giamatti, \"everyone will want one like it.\" And so it came to be: Camden Yards' successors in Cleveland, Arlington (Texas), and Denver, and those designed for Milwaukee, Seattle, and San Francisco, take their cues from Baltimore's conceptual breakthrough. Even totally nontraditional parks, like those in Phoenix, Miami, and Tampa Bay, emulate the asymmetry of the Camden Yards outfield. It's almost as though a disembodied voice intoned, \"If you build it, they will copy.\" \n\n         While Camden Yards and its offspring are almost universally praised, some of them don't deserve the hype. The most annoying hype is that all the new parks are intimate, and that every seat is better at the new place than the old. Intimacy has two aspects--actual size and the subjective perception of size and scale. A good architect can ace the second part of the test through convincing forms, good proportions, and attractive materials. The exposed steelwork, brick, stone, tile, and well-placed wall openings of the new parks beat the cold and sterile stadiums of a generation ago. \n\n         For the new parks' charms, we should be thankful. But in actual size, the new ballyards are not intimate. All their amenities--elevators, wider concourses, abundant toilets (especially for women), bathrooms, escalators, plentiful food stands, and luxury suites--make them far larger than the parks they claim to emulate. These parks are larger than even the multipurpose hulks we all love to hate. Compare, for instance, the spanking new Ballpark at Arlington (49,100 seats), which rests on 13.6 acres, to Seattle's Kingdome, a 58,000-seat multipurpose stadium that opened in 1976 and covers 9.3 acres. (Ebbets Field, home to the Brooklyn Dodgers, occupied a mere 5.7 acres and seated 32,000.) \n\n         Or compare heights: New Comiskey Park's roof is 146 feet above field level; old Comiskey Park was about 75 feet high. This is not ballpark trivia, but an indicator of fan experience: Upper-deck seats in the new, taller stadiums are farther away from the action. At Arlington, the fan sitting in the middle-row, upper-deck seat closest to home plate is 224 feet from the batter, compared to 125 feet at Tiger Stadium, a park with 4,300 more seats. \n\n         Why are upper-deck seats in the new parks so far from the game? Two reasons: column placement and luxury seating. \n\n         In the old parks, the structural columns stood within the seating areas, placing the upper-deck seats closer to the game. The trade-off was that these columns obstructed the view of some fans. Today's architects \"remedy\" the problem by placing the columns behind the seating areas, thus moving the upper decks back from the field. (It should be noted that the new parks' claim that they have no impaired-view seats is an overstatement.) \n\n         Added tiers devoted to luxury seating at the new parks also push the upper deck away from the field. The retreat of that deck is a century-long process, but it can be stemmed. The Orioles pressed for several design changes that lowered Camden Yards' top deck and produced a middle-row viewing distance of 199 feet, about eight rows closer than Arlington's. \n\n         Design references to golden-age ballparks are only one parallel between that period and ours. We are also matching that era's frenzied pace of construction: Twenty-six of Major League Baseball's 32 franchises occupy a park that is less than 10 years old; has been, or will be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move into a new one soon. \n\n         One of the classic parks' merits was that they were unsubsidized. Team owners bought land and paid for stadium construction--some even built trolley lines to transport fans to the games. In all but two cases during the last 65 years, taxpayers have covered most or all of the costs of stadium building. \n\n         The San Francisco Giants are planning a similar arrangement for their bayfront stadium, assembling about $240 million in private funds and persuading the city to pay for some of the infrastructure. The Giants say that other team owners are rooting against their scheme, because it calls into question the profligate public subsidies. Some of the subsidies exceed capital and maintenance costs: If the White Sox fail to draw 1.5 million annual fans at New Comiskey Park in the 11th through 20th years of their lease, the state of Illinois is contractually obliged to cover the shortfall at the gate by buying upto 300,000 tickets. \n\n         You'd expect that the public would get something, perhaps affordable seats, in return for subsidizing stadiums. Instead, the cheap seats in the new parks are scarcer. The Seattle Mariners' proposed park, for instance, will contain about one-fourth as many general-admission seats as the present location. This erosion of low-cost seats is a long-running trend. \n\n         So too is the dramatic increase in luxury seating, which is the primary real reason for the ballpark-building boom. The real gold mines are the posh luxury suites that lease for between $30,000 and $200,000 a year (payable in advance). A comparable moneymaker is the club deck, just above the first-tier seating. These pricey sections are occupied usually on a season-ticket basis, and offer the best sightlines, roomier seats, and wait staff who peddle gourmet fare. \n\n         The gilding doesn't end there: New parks also include members-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants. \n\n          Naturally, owners don't advertise their new parks as a means of making life better for elite ticketholders. They say that only a new stadium will allow them to make enough money to stay in town or to field a competitive team and to allow fans to savor that old-time baseball flavor in greater comfort and convenience. Local taxpayers tend to lay off this pitch--they have voted these measures down in Illinois, Washington state, California, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Politically savvy owners usually bypass the voters and tap state governments directly for the money. \n\n         Larger and more lavish stadiums translate into greater land and construction costs. Operable roofs, such as those in Toronto's SkyDome, Phoenix's BankOne Ballpark, and those proposed for Seattle and Milwaukee, are budget-busters. Since most teams put up little (if any) of their own money, they have scant incentive to economize on the parks. In Seattle, Mariner management has demanded an operable roof even though the city has the driest weather in MLB outside California. The real problem with the Seattle climate is cold weather in spring and fall, but the unsealed roof won't make the park warmer or totally free of wind. \n\n         Lately, the cost of stadiums has ranged from about $300 million to $500 million. The multipurpose stadium that the Yankees want built on Manhattan's lower west side tentatively carries a $1 billion price tag. Add the financing and maintenance costs, and even a midpriced project goes through the retractable roof. At one point, the cost of the Brewers' proposed stadium grew from $250 million to $845 million, and that's not counting the value of the land. \n\n         The good news is that not every owner is demanding a castle for his team. All Pittsburgh Pirates owner Kevin McClatchy wants is a \"35,000-to-37,000-seat park with natural grass and no roof, bells, or whistles.\" Though his attitude is commendable, the proposed park will still cost about $200 million, and perhaps an equal amount in interest. \n\n         Why should the public chip in? Taxpayer subsidies don't produce cheaper tickets--they produce more expensive tickets. The average admission price (not counting club seats and suites) rises about 35 percent when a team moves into new digs. And independent economists (i.e., those not hired by stadium proponents) discount the claim that new stadiums spur regional economic growth. \n\n         But one compelling argument for subsidies is that new stadiums can pull their cities together when properly designed and sited. This requires a downtown or neighborhood location where lots of fans can take the bus or the train to the game; where they can walk to the stadium from work, hotels, restaurants, or bars; and where getting to the game is a communal event that is part of a broader urban experience. This is the case with older parks such as Wrigley Field and Fenway Park, and the new ones in Toronto, Baltimore, Cleveland, and Denver. \n\n         \"If you put them in the wrong place, it's a colossal waste of money,\" says the planning director of the city of Cleveland. \"But if you put them in the right place, the benefits are phenomenal,\" \n\n         Recent attendance patterns show that urban parks generate much better patronage than suburban ones or those in neither/nor locations. There are also strong indicators that suggest new urban parks have \"legs,\" retaining more of their patrons after the novelty wears off. But some teams deliberately seek isolated locations, where they can better monopolize parking revenues and game-related food, drink, and souvenir business. This is why the White Sox moated their park with 100 acres of parking, why the Milwaukee Brewers refuse to build downtown, and why the Mariners insisted on the most remote of Seattle's three ballpark-siting options. \n\n         Modern conveniences aside, the new baseball shrines are a mixed bag. Most are visually impressive, boast interestingly shaped playing fields, and start off as box-office hits. But too many of them are large and expensive, tend to live on the dole, and are hampered by seat layouts that create a caste system among fans. At their best, they strengthen their cities; at their worst, they exploit them. \n\n         The decision-making process behind the financing and building of new ballparks has become predictable, as have the designs. But the good news is that our stadium boom is far from over. If owners and public agencies can be persuaded to take a longer view of stadium economics and community concerns, we may yet see parks that better unite traditional character with modern convenience.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat are some of the design features that the author highlights as beneficial about the new park designs?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"There is a greater diversity of dining\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The fields have new shapes\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The fields have new shapes\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cThe fields have new shapes\u201d (Debater_B)\n\nI. New field shapes are repeatedly lauded as the signature design breakthrough and directly correlated with the parks\u2019 success  \n  1. <invalid_quote>\u201cBaltimore\u2019s Oriole Park at Camden Yards revived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical\u2026city-friendly ballpark.\u201d</invalid_quote> (\u00b64)  \n     \u2013 Commissioner Giamatti predicted immediate emulation.  \n     \u2013 Successive parks in Cleveland, Arlington, Denver, Milwaukee, Seattle, San Francisco, Phoenix, Miami, Tampa Bay \u201ctake their cues\u201d or \u201cemulate the asymmetry\u201d (\u00b64).  \n  2. Universal praise for new parks stems from their distinctive playing-field geometry, not merely from food or luxury amenities (\u00b65).  \n     \u2013 Even \u201ctotally nontraditional parks\u2026emulate the asymmetry\u201d solely for the field design benefit.  \n  3. Asymmetrical outfields and \u201cinteresting shaped playing fields\u201d are cited as visual and experiential improvements (\u00b619).  \n     \u2013 Fans respond to unique dimensions and sightlines.  \n     \u2013 These shapes restore intimacy via \u201cgood proportions\u201d and \u201cconvincing forms\u201d (\u00b65), enhancing the spectator experience.  \n\nII. New field shapes achieve the desired \u201cintimacy\u201d while preserving modern amenities  \n  1. Subjective perception of size and scale depends largely on the field\u2019s geometry and proximity; asymmetry creates a sense of enclosure and closeness (\u00b65).  \n     \u2013 Field shape works in tandem with lower decks; Orioles further \u201clowered Camden Yards\u2019 top deck\u201d to get seats \u201cabout eight rows closer than Arlington\u2019s\u201d (\u00b68).  \n  2. Innovative column placement (behind seating) is only feasible thanks to the structural flexibility allowed by steel frameworks and asymmetrical shapes (\u00b69).  \n     \u2013 This trade-off is only acceptable because the field shapes themselves improve sightlines so much that \u201cno impaired-view seats\u201d is at least claimed (\u00b69).  \n\nIII. Attacking \u201cGreater diversity of dining\u201d as the correct answer  \n  1. Dining and concessions are generic to all modern stadiums, including multipurpose \u201cconcrete monsters\u201d of the \u201970s (\u00b62\u20133).  \n     \u2013 The author acknowledges \u201cabundant food stands\u201d and \u201cgourmet fare\u201d (\u00b65, \u00b614) simply as necessary amenities for size, not as defining design innovations.  \n     \u2013 Multipurpose hulks also include concessions; yet they are criticized for lack of character and intimacy (\u00b62).  \n  2. The question asks for \u201cdesign features\u2026about the new park designs,\u201d which refers to architectural and spatial innovations, not merely food or bars (\u00b619).  \n  3. Dining improvements do not require the \u201cquirkily asymmetrical\u201d layouts, the steel-and-brick fa\u00e7ades, or urban siting that are repeatedly highlighted as the parks\u2019 conceptual breakthroughs (\u00b64, \u00b618).  \n\nIV. Conclusion  \n  1. Only the asymmetrical, novel field shapes are universally emulated and praised as the conceptual breakthrough that defines the \u201cnew park designs.\u201d  \n  2. Dining variety, while present, is incidental to the architectural character, intimacy, and fan experience improvements that the author repeatedly credits to innovative field geometry.  \n  3.

Urban siting \u201cwhere they can walk to the stadium from\u2026 restaurants, or bars\u201d (<quote> where they can walk to the stadium from work, hotels, restaurants, or bars;</quote>) turns games into a communal event that extends into diverse pre- and post-game dining.  \n3.

Asymmetry alone fails to solve fundamental problems of distance and scale.  \n   b. Asymmetry is imitated because it is novel, not because it improves fan experience beyond visuals. Fans cannot taste or spend time at field edges.  \n2. No link to amenities or revenue  \n   a. Field shape generates no ancillary revenue, unlike dining, luxury suites, or clubs. Authors repeatedly discuss subsidies and financing driven by revenue from food and drink, not by unique field contours.  \n   b. The author\u2019s concern over cost overruns (operable roofs, parking) would be unnecessary if field shape were the primary driver; instead, owners push lavish dining and luxury to justify public subsidies.  \n3. Dining diversity directly addresses author\u2019s call for urban integration  \n   a. Urban siting and communal walking emphasize the social/dining aspect of attendance. Field shape offers no reason for fans to visit nearby bars or restaurants before or after the game.  \n   b. Dining diversity leverages the city environment; field shape exists only within the stadium and cannot foster urban economic growth as the author advocates.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe author repeatedly emphasizes modern amenities\u2014particularly varied, upscale dining options\u2014as critical design achievements that blend \u201cold-time baseball flavor\u201d with modern convenience, drive revenue, sustain attendance, and integrate stadiums into urban life.

Therefore, \u201cThe fields have new shapes\u201d is the correct and complete answer.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cGreater Diversity of Dining\u201d as a Key Design Feature\n\n1. Author\u2019s Repeated Emphasis on Food and Beverage Amenities  \n  a. \u201cAll their amenities\u2026 plentiful food stands, and luxury suites\u201d (\u00b65) are listed among the very first benefits of the new parks. If dining were incidental, it would not headline the amenities.  \n  b. \u201cNew parks also include members-only stadium clubs and on\u2010premises bars and restaurants\u201d (\u00b614). The author singles out bars and restaurants\u2014distinct from mere concession stands\u2014as integral design elements.  \n\n2. Dining Variety Drives Revenue and Justifies Scale  \n  a. \u201cThe real gold mines are the posh luxury suites\u2026 club deck\u201d (\u00b615) \u2013 these are high\u2010margin, food\u2010centric experiences. Luxury suites depend on gourmet fare (\u00b65) and club\u2010deck services to command rents of $30,000\u2013$200,000 a year.  \n  b. Owners \u201cseek isolated locations\u2026 to monopolize\u2026 game\u2010related food, drink\u201d (\u00b618). They would not expend political capital or public subsidy on parks merely for a novel field shape; they build elaborate hospitality facilities to maximize concession revenues.  \n\n3. Dining and Urban Integration Fulfill Author\u2019s Vision of \u201cPhenomenal\u201d Benefits  \n  a. A compelling case for subsidies is that parks \u201cwhere they can walk\u2026 from work, hotels, restaurants, or bars\u201d (\u00b618) create a \u201ccommunal event\u201d that extends beyond the game. Dining is the social glue that binds fans before and after play.  \n  b. \u201cUrban parks generate much better patronage\u2026 have \u2018legs\u2019\u201d (\u00b619). Repeat attendance after novelty fades depends on varied social and culinary experiences, not on field geometry alone.  \n\n4. Expanded Amenities Depend on Space and Flow for Dining  \n  a. Wider concourses, elevators, escalators (\u00b65) are justified by the need to move patrons among diverse food and drink venues throughout the stadium.  \n  b. Operable roofs (\u00b617) and luxury clubs demand additional space for hospitality, not for staging quirky outfield angles.  \n\nRebuttal of \u201cNew Field Shapes\u201d Position\n\n1. Asymmetry Alone Does Not Create Intimacy or Economic Impact  \n  a. The author criticizes \u201cconcrete monsters\u201d (\u00b62) despite any outfield shape; these multipurpose stadia also offered concessions but \u201clack the character\u201d and fail to integrate urban life. Field shape without dining and urban siting is insufficient.  \n  b. Even Camden Yards required \u201cdesign changes that lowered\u2026 top deck\u201d (\u00b68) to achieve intimacy. This demonstrates that geometry alone was inadequate; architects still manipulated viewing distance to enhance experience.  \n\n2. Field Shapes Do Not Drive Financing or Public Support  \n  a. Taxpayer subsidies and political battles (\u00b616, \u00b617) hinge on owners\u2019 promise of economic growth via downtown revitalization\u2014driven by foot traffic, restaurants, and bars\u2014not by niche playing-field dimensions.  \n  b. Independent economists \u201cdiscount the claim that new stadiums spur regional economic growth\u201d (\u00b616) unless they are \u201cproperly designed and sited\u201d (\u00b618) for urban hospitality. Field shape cannot revitalize neighborhoods; adjacent dining and mixed\u2010use development can.  \n\n3. Dining Is a Distinctive Improvement Absent in Prior Multipurpose Parks  \n  a. The \u201970s multipurpose parks (Kingdome, Astrodome, etc.) offered concessions yet \u201cwe all love to hate\u201d them for sterility (\u00b62). The author praises the new parks\u2019 \u201cattractive materials\u201d and \u201cwell-placed wall openings\u201d (\u00b65) only in conjunction with amenities that invite socializing\u2014i.e., dining and clubs.  \n  b. Nontraditional parks \u201cemulate the asymmetry\u201d (\u00b64) even where urban siting and dining are absent (Phoenix, Miami). Yet the author qualifies that not all deserve \u201cthe hype\u201d (\u00b65). Poor attendance at isolated sites underscores that field shape without hospitality fails.  \n\n4. Dining Variety Enhances Spectator Experience More Broadly  \n  a. Fans \u201clinger\u201d and socialize; they do not pay a premium merely to gaze at outfield angles.  \n  b. Luxury suites, club decks, and members\u2010only clubs indicate a shift from mere viewing to an immersive experience centered on food and beverage quality.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe author consistently frames modern dining\u2014plentiful food stands, gourmet fare in luxury suites, bars, restaurants, and club decks\u2014as a defining innovation that justifies scale, integrates parks into urban life, and sustains attendance. Field shapes are secondary aesthetic elements that, without associated hospitality and urban siting, fail to deliver character, intimacy, or economic benefits. Therefore, \u201cgreater diversity of dining\u201d is the correct answer.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Continued Emphasis on Asymmetrical Field Geometry  \n  1. \u201cConceptual breakthrough\u201d and Universal Emulation  \n     a. The author asserts that Baltimore\u2019s Camden Yards \u201crevived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical, relatively intimate, steel-structured, city-friendly ballpark\u201d and that \u201ceveryone will want one like it\u201d (\u00b64). This prophecy came true across diverse climates and markets\u2014Cleveland, Arlington, Denver, Milwaukee, Seattle, San Francisco, Phoenix, Miami, Tampa Bay\u2014\u201cemulat[ing] the asymmetry\u201d (\u00b64). A design feature imitated so widely cannot be merely aesthetic window-dressing; it is the core innovation that distinguishes \u201cnew park designs.\u201d  \n     b. Even \u201ctotally nontraditional parks\u201d adopt asymmetrical outfields rather than rerunning the multipurpose \u201cconcrete monsters\u201d of the \u201960s and \u201970s, demonstrating that it is field shape\u2014rather than dining, clubs, or roofs\u2014that drives the new design vocabulary (\u00b62\u20133, \u00b64).  \n  2. Enhanced Intimacy and Spectator Experience  \n     a. The author specifies two aspects of intimacy: actual size and \u201csubjective perception of size and scale\u201d (\u00b65). Quirky field geometries and \u201cgood proportions\u201d create a convincing sense of enclosure despite larger footprints. Without these asymmetrical shapes, modern parks remain criticized for lack of character (\u00b62\u20133).  \n     b. Structural advances that reposition columns \u201cbehind the seating areas\u201d (\u00b69) would only be acceptable to fans if the novel outfield shapes and sightlines sufficiently compensate for the greater distances and higher decks. The fact that architects \u201cremedy\u201d impaired views via deeper decks only because no impaired views are \u201cclaimed\u201d (\u00b69) underscores that field geometry is central to perceived comfort.  \n  3. Owner and Commissioner Testimony  \n     a. Commissioner Bart Giamatti\u2019s public endorsement of Camden Yards\u2019 design as the turning point in stadium architecture (\u00b64) exclusively highlights field asymmetry and \u201crelatively intimate\u201d sightlines\u2014not dining variants or bars. If dining were the breakthrough, Giamatti and imitators would have championed that instead.  \n     b. The Orioles themselves \u201cpressed for several design changes that lowered Camden Yards\u2019 top deck and produced a middle-row viewing distance of 199 feet\u201d (\u00b68), underscoring their concern for field proximity and geometry above all else.  \n\nII. Dining and Concessions Are Incidental, Not Defining, Innovations  \n  1. Concessions in Old and Multipurpose Parks  \n     a. The pre-Camden \u201cconcrete monsters\u201d of the postwar era already featured \u201cabundant toilets\u2026 plentiful food stands\u201d (\u00b65) and were sometimes subsidized yet still \u201cvastly inferior\u201d places to watch ballgames (\u00b62\u20133). If dining alone delivered the desired fan experience, these parks would not have been deemed failures.  \n     b. Multipurpose venues such as the Kingdome (\u00b66) or SkyDome (\u00b616) provide modern concessions and even operable roofs, yet they \u201clack the character of the classic parks\u201d and fail to generate the urban \u201clegs\u201d that asymmetrical, intimate parks achieve (\u00b62\u20133, \u00b618\u201319).  \n  2. Dining Does Not Drive Sit-ing, Revenue, or Public Support  \n     a. The text repeatedly laments \u201cprofligate public subsidies\u201d and \u201cerosion of low-cost seats\u201d (\u00b612, \u00b614), indicating that revenue incentives favor luxury suites and capacity more than mere concession sales. Dining revenue exists in all stadium models, yet only those with distinctive field geometries secure \u201cbetter patronage,\u201d \u201cretain patrons,\u201d and \u201cstrengthen their cities\u201d (\u00b618\u201319).  \n     b. If dining diversity were the true breakthrough, teams would not \u201cseek isolated locations, where they can better monopolize parking revenues and game-related food, drink\u201d (\u00b618)\u2014a strategy that sacrifices urban foot traffic and context precisely to extract more from captive fans, not to foster the communal urban experience the author praises (\u00b618\u201319).  \n  3. Authorial Focus and Praise  \n     a. The author\u2019s repeated refrain that new stadiums are \u201cvisually impressive\u201d with \u201cinteresting shaped playing fields\u201d (\u00b619) and that they restore \u201cintimacy\u201d through \u201cgood proportions\u201d (\u00b65) shows sustained focus on architectural form over culinary variety.  \n     b. Dining enhancements are mentioned as part of a laundry list of modern necessities (\u00b65, \u00b614), never as the \u201cconceptual breakthrough\u201d that restarted the ballpark boom or as the metric by which the Kingdome was judged inferior.  \n\nIII. Refuting \u201cUrban Dining Community\u201d Argument  \n  1. Urban Integration Requires Walkable, Engaging Spaces  \n     a. The author contends that only parks \u201cproperly designed and sited\u201d downtown \u201cproduce phenomenal\u201d community benefits, citing older parks and new ones with Camden-inspired geometry in Toronto, Baltimore, Cleveland, and Denver (\u00b618). Urban siting must be paired with distinctive asymmetrical facades and fields that blend with city streetscapes. Dining alone, without character and intimacy, is insufficient to attract sustained foot traffic or to convince taxpayers\u2014voters repeatedly reject subsidies when the venue is a multipurpose hulK (\u00b618).  \n     b. If dining were the linchpin, teams would invest in bars and restaurants adjacent to multipurpose stadiums, but evidence shows they instead abandon urban sites to exploit captive parking and concessions (\u00b618).  \n\nIV. Conclusion  \n  1. The author\u2019s consistent praise of field asymmetry, repeated emulation by rival teams, and focus on intimacy and character\u2014all absent in multipurpose and dining-centric venues\u2014establish \u201cnew-shaped playing fields\u201d as the pivotal design feature.  \n  2. Dining and luxury suites, while necessary for modern economics, are ancillary amenities already available in pre-Camden parks and criticized stadiums; they do not account for the \u201cconceptual breakthrough\u201d or superior urban performance described.  \n  3. Therefore, only \u201cThe fields have new shapes\u201d fully answers what the author highlights as beneficial design features of the new park designs.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
