{"metadata": {"first_debater_correct": true, "question_idx": 49, "background_text": "The Anglers of Arz By Roger Dee Illustrated by BOB MARTIN [Transcriber Note: This etext was produced from IF Worlds of Science  Fiction January 1953. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence  that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] There were two pinkish, bipedal fishermen on the tiny  islet. In order to make Izaak Walton's sport complete, there must  be an angler, a fish, and some bait. All three existed on Arz but there  was a question as to which was which. The third night of the Marco Four's landfall on the moonless Altarian  planet was a repetition of the two before it, a nine-hour intermission  of drowsy, pastoral peace. Navigator Arthur Farrell\u2014it was his turn to  stand watch\u2014was sitting at an open-side port with a magnoscanner ready;  but in spite of his vigilance he had not exposed a film when the  inevitable pre-dawn rainbow began to shimmer over the eastern ocean.\n\n\n Sunrise brought him alert with a jerk, frowning at sight of two pinkish,  bipedal Arzian fishermen posted on the tiny coral islet a quarter-mile  offshore, their blank triangular faces turned stolidly toward the beach.\n\n\n \"They're at it again,\" Farrell called, and dropped to the mossy turf  outside. \"Roll out on the double! I'm going to magnofilm this!\"\n\n\n Stryker and Gibson came out of their sleeping cubicles reluctantly,  belting on the loose shorts which all three wore in the balmy Arzian  climate. Stryker blinked and yawned as he let himself through the port,  his fringe of white hair tousled and his naked paunch sweating. He  looked, Farrell thought for the thousandth time, more like a retired  cook than like the veteran commander of a Terran Colonies expedition.\n\n\n Gibson followed, stretching his powerfully-muscled body like a wrestler  to throw off the effects of sleep. Gibson was linguist-ethnologist of  the crew, a blocky man in his early thirties with thick black hair and  heavy brows that shaded a square, humorless face.\n\n\n \"Any sign of the squids yet?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"They won't show up until the dragons come,\" Farrell said. He adjusted  the light filter of the magnoscanner and scowled at Stryker. \"Lee, I  wish you'd let me break up the show this time with a dis-beam. This  butchery gets on my nerves.\"\n\n\n Stryker shielded his eyes with his hands against the glare of sun on  water. \"You know I can't do that, Arthur. These Arzians may turn out to  be Fifth Order beings or higher, and under Terran Regulations our  tampering with what may be a basic culture-pattern would amount to armed  invasion. We'll have to crack that cackle-and-grunt language of theirs  and learn something of their mores before we can interfere.\"\n\n\n Farrell turned an irritable stare on the incurious group of Arzians  gathering, nets and fishing spears in hand, at the edge of the  sheltering bramble forest.\n\n\n \"What stumps me is their motivation,\" he said. \"Why do the fools go out  to that islet every night, when they must know damned well what will  happen next morning?\"\n\n\n Gibson answered him with an older problem, his square face puzzled. \"For  that matter, what became of the city I saw when we came in through the  stratosphere? It must be a tremendous thing, yet we've searched the  entire globe in the scouter and found nothing but water and a scattering  of little islands like this one, all covered with bramble. It wasn't a  city these pink fishers could have built, either. The architecture was  beyond them by a million years.\" Stryker and Farrell traded baffled looks. The city had become something  of a fixation with Gibson, and his dogged insistence\u2014coupled with an  irritating habit of being right\u2014had worn their patience thin.\n\n\n \"There never was a city here, Gib,\" Stryker said. \"You dozed off while  we were making planetfall, that's all.\"\n\n\n Gibson stiffened resentfully, but Farrell's voice cut his protest short.  \"Get set! Here they come!\"\n\n\n Out of the morning rainbow dropped a swarm of winged lizards, twenty  feet in length and a glistening chlorophyll green in the early light.  They stooped like hawks upon the islet offshore, burying the two Arzian  fishers instantly under their snapping, threshing bodies. Then around  the outcrop the sea boiled whitely, churned to foam by a sudden  uprushing of black, octopoid shapes.\n\n\n \"The squids,\" Stryker grunted. \"Right on schedule. Two seconds too late,  as usual, to stop the slaughter.\"\n\n\n A barrage of barbed tentacles lashed out of the foam and drove into the  melee of winged lizards. The lizards took the air at once, leaving  behind three of their number who disappeared under the surface like  harpooned seals. No trace remained of the two Arzian natives.\n\n\n \"A neat example of dog eat dog,\" Farrell said, snapping off the  magnoscanner. \"Do any of those beauties look like city-builders, Gib?\"\n\n\n Chattering pink natives straggled past from the shelter of the thorn  forest, ignoring the Earthmen, and lined the casting ledges along the  beach to begin their day's fishing.\n\n\n \"Nothing we've seen yet could have built that city,\" Gibson said  stubbornly. \"But it's here somewhere, and I'm going to find it. Will  either of you be using the scouter today?\"\n\n\n Stryker threw up his hands. \"I've a mountain of data to collate, and  Arthur is off duty after standing watch last night. Help yourself, but  you won't find anything.\" The scouter was a speeding dot on the horizon when Farrell crawled into  his sleeping cubicle a short time later, leaving Stryker to mutter over  his litter of notes. Sleep did not come to him at once; a vague sense of  something overlooked prodded irritatingly at the back of his  consciousness, but it was not until drowsiness had finally overtaken him  that the discrepancy assumed definite form.\n\n\n He recalled then that on the first day of the Marco's planetfall one  of the pink fishers had fallen from a casting ledge into the water, and  had all but drowned before his fellows pulled him out with extended  spear-shafts. Which meant that the fishers could not swim, else some  would surely have gone in after him.\n\n\n And the Marco's crew had explored Arz exhaustively without finding any  slightest trace of boats or of boat landings. The train of association  completed itself with automatic logic, almost rousing Farrell out of his  doze.\n\n\n \"I'll be damned,\" he muttered. \"No boats, and they don't swim. Then how  the devil do they get out to that islet? \"\n\n\n He fell asleep with the paradox unresolved. Stryker was still humped over his records when Farrell came out of his  cubicle and broke a packaged meal from the food locker. The visicom over  the control board hummed softly, its screen blank on open channel.\n\n\n \"Gibson found his lost city yet?\" Farrell asked, and grinned when  Stryker snorted.\n\n\n \"He's scouring the daylight side now,\" Stryker said. \"Arthur, I'm going  to ground Gib tomorrow, much as I dislike giving him a direct order.  He's got that phantom city on the brain, and he lacks the imagination to  understand how dangerous to our assignment an obsession of that sort can  be.\"\n\n\n Farrell shrugged. \"I'd agree with you offhand if it weren't for Gib's  bullheaded habit of being right. I hope he finds it soon, if it's here.  I'll probably be standing his watch until he's satisfied.\"\n\n\n Stryker looked relieved. \"Would you mind taking it tonight? I'm  completely bushed after today's logging.\"\n\n\n Farrell waved a hand and took up his magnoscanner. It was dark outside  already, the close, soft night of a moonless tropical world whose moist  atmosphere absorbed even starlight. He dragged a chair to the open port  and packed his pipe, settling himself comfortably while Stryker mixed a  nightcap before turning in.\n\n\n Later he remembered that Stryker dissolved a tablet in his glass, but at  the moment it meant nothing. In a matter of minutes the older man's  snoring drifted to him, a sound faintly irritating against the velvety  hush outside.\n\n\n Farrell lit his pipe and turned to the inconsistencies he had uncovered.  The Arzians did not swim, and without boats....\n\n\n It occurred to him then that there had been two of the pink fishers on  the islet each morning, and the coincidence made him sit up suddenly,  startled. Why two? Why not three or four, or only one?\n\n\n He stepped out through the open lock and paced restlessly up and down on  the springy turf, feeling the ocean breeze soft on his face. Three days  of dull routine logwork had built up a need for physical action that  chafed his temper; he was intrigued and at the same time annoyed by the  enigmatic relation that linked the Arzian fishers to the dragons and  squids, and his desire to understand that relation was aggravated by the  knowledge that Arz could be a perfect world for Terran colonization.  That is, he thought wryly, if Terran colonists could stomach the weird  custom pursued by its natives of committing suicide in pairs.\n\n\n He went over again the improbable drama of the past three mornings, and  found it not too unnatural until he came to the motivation and the means  of transportation that placed the Arzians in pairs on the islet, when  his whole fabric of speculation fell into a tangled snarl of  inconsistencies. He gave it up finally; how could any Earthman  rationalize the outlandish compulsions that actuated so alien a race?\n\n\n He went inside again, and the sound of Stryker's muffled snoring fanned  his restlessness. He made his decision abruptly, laying aside the  magnoscanner for a hand-flash and a pocket-sized audicom unit which he  clipped to the belt of his shorts.\n\n\n He did not choose a weapon because he saw no need for one. The torch  would show him how the natives reached the outcrop, and if he should  need help the audicom would summon Stryker. Investigating without  Stryker's sanction was, strictly speaking, a breach of Terran  Regulations, but\u2014\n\n\n \"Damn Terran Regulations,\" he muttered. \"I've got to know .\"\n\n\n Farrell snapped on the torch at the edge of the thorn forest and entered  briskly, eager for action now that he had begun. Just inside the edge of  the bramble he came upon a pair of Arzians curled up together on the  mossy ground, sleeping soundly, their triangular faces wholly blank and  unrevealing.\n\n\n He worked deeper into the underbrush and found other sleeping couples,  but nothing else. There were no humming insects, no twittering  night-birds or scurrying rodents. He had worked his way close to the  center of the island without further discovery and was on the point of  turning back, disgusted, when something bulky and powerful seized him  from behind.\n\n\n A sharp sting burned his shoulder, wasp-like, and a sudden overwhelming  lassitude swept him into a darkness deeper than the Arzian night. His  last conscious thought was not of his own danger, but of Stryker\u2014asleep  and unprotected behind the Marco's open port.... He was standing erect when he woke, his back to the open sea and a  prismatic glimmer of early-dawn rainbow shining on the water before him.  For a moment he was totally disoriented; then from the corner of an eye  he caught the pinkish blur of an Arzian fisher standing beside him, and  cried out hoarsely in sudden panic when he tried to turn his head and  could not.\n\n\n He was on the coral outcropping offshore, and except for the involuntary  muscles of balance and respiration his body was paralyzed.\n\n\n The first red glow of sunrise blurred the reflected rainbow at his feet,  but for some seconds his shuttling mind was too busy to consider the  danger of predicament. Whatever brought me here anesthetized me first ,  he thought. That sting in my shoulder was like a hypo needle. Panic seized him again when he remembered the green flying-lizards; more  seconds passed before he gained control of himself, sweating with the  effort. He had to get help. If he could switch on the audicom at his  belt and call Stryker....\n\n\n He bent every ounce of his will toward raising his right hand, and  failed.\n\n\n His arm was like a limb of lead, its inertia too great to budge. He  relaxed the effort with a groan, sweating again when he saw a fiery  half-disk of sun on the water, edges blurred and distorted by tiny  surface ripples.\n\n\n On shore he could see the Marco Four resting between thorn forest and  beach, its silvered sides glistening with dew. The port was still open,  and the empty carrier rack in the bow told him that Gibson had not yet  returned with the scouter.\n\n\n He grew aware then that sensation was returning to him slowly, that the  cold surface of the audicom unit at his hip\u2014unfelt before\u2014was pressing  against the inner curve of his elbow. He bent his will again toward  motion; this time the arm tensed a little, enough to send hope flaring  through him. If he could put pressure enough against the stud....\n\n\n The tiny click of its engaging sent him faint with relief.\n\n\n \"Stryker!\" he yelled. \"Lee, roll out\u2014 Stryker !\"\n\n\n The audicom hummed gently, without answer.\n\n\n He gathered himself for another shout, and recalled with a chill of  horror the tablet Stryker had mixed into his nightcap the night before.  Worn out by his work, Stryker had made certain that he would not be  easily disturbed.\n\n\n The flattened sun-disk on the water brightened and grew rounder. Above  its reflected glare he caught a flicker of movement, a restless  suggestion of flapping wings. He tried again. \"Stryker, help me! I'm on the islet!\"\n\n\n The audicom crackled. The voice that answered was not Stryker's, but  Gibson's.\n\n\n \"Farrell! What the devil are you doing on that butcher's block?\"\n\n\n Farrell fought down an insane desire to laugh. \"Never mind that\u2014get  here fast, Gib! The flying-lizards\u2014\"\n\n\n He broke off, seeing for the first time the octopods that ringed the  outcrop just under the surface of the water, waiting with barbed  tentacles spread and yellow eyes studying him glassily. He heard the  unmistakable flapping of wings behind and above him then, and thought  with shock-born lucidity: I wanted a backstage look at this show, and  now I'm one of the cast .\n\n\n The scouter roared in from the west across the thorn forest, flashing so  close above his head that he felt the wind of its passage. Almost  instantly he heard the shrilling blast of its emergency bow jets as  Gibson met the lizard swarm head on.\n\n\n Gibson's voice came tinnily from the audicom. \"Scattered them for the  moment, Arthur\u2014blinded the whole crew with the exhaust, I think. Stand  fast, now. I'm going to pick you up.\"\n\n\n The scouter settled on the outcrop beside Farrell, so close that the hot  wash of its exhaust gases scorched his bare legs. Gibson put out thick  brown arms and hauled him inside like a straw man, ignoring the native.  The scouter darted for shore with Farrell lying across Gibson's knees in  the cockpit, his head hanging half overside.\n\n\n Farrell had a last dizzy glimpse of the islet against the rush of green  water below, and felt his shaky laugh of relief stick in his throat. Two  of the octopods were swimming strongly for shore, holding the rigid  Arzian native carefully above water between them.\n\n\n \"Gib,\" Farrell croaked. \"Gib, can you risk a look back? I think I've  gone mad.\"\n\n\n The scouter swerved briefly as Gibson looked back. \"You're all right,  Arthur. Just hang on tight. I'll explain everything when we get you safe  in the Marco .\"\n\n\n Farrell forced himself to relax, more relieved than alarmed by the  painful pricking of returning sensation. \"I might have known it, damn  you,\" he said. \"You found your lost city, didn't you?\"\n\n\n Gibson sounded a little disgusted, as if he were still angry with  himself over some private stupidity. \"I'd have found it sooner if I'd  had any brains. It was under water, of course.\" In the Marco Four , Gibson routed Stryker out of his cubicle and mixed  drinks around, leaving Farrell comfortably relaxed in the padded control  chair. The paralysis was still wearing off slowly, easing Farrell's fear  of being permanently disabled.\n\n\n \"We never saw the city from the scouter because we didn't go high  enough,\" Gibson said. \"I realized that finally, remembering how they  used high-altitude blimps during the First Wars to spot submarines, and  when I took the scouter up far enough there it was, at the ocean  bottom\u2014a city to compare with anything men ever built.\"\n\n\n Stryker stared. \"A marine city? What use would sea-creatures have for  buildings?\"\n\n\n \"None,\" Gibson said. \"I think the city must have been built ages ago\u2014by  men or by a manlike race, judging from the architecture\u2014and was  submerged later by a sinking of land masses that killed off the original  builders and left Arz nothing but an oversized archipelago. The squids  took over then, and from all appearances they've developed a culture of  their own.\"\n\n\n \"I don't see it,\" Stryker complained, shaking his head. \"The pink  fishers\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Are cattle, or less,\" Gibson finished. \"The octopods are the dominant  race, and they're so far above Fifth Order that we're completely out of  bounds here. Under Terran Regulations we can't colonize Arz. It would be  armed invasion.\"\n\n\n \"Invasion of a squid world?\" Farrell protested, baffled. \"Why should  surface colonization conflict with an undersea culture, Gib? Why  couldn't we share the planet?\"\n\n\n \"Because the octopods own the islands too, and keep them policed,\"  Gibson said patiently. \"They even own the pink fishers. It was one of  the squid-people, making a dry-land canvass of his preserve here to pick  a couple of victims for this morning's show, that carried you off last  night.\"\n\n\n \"Behold a familiar pattern shaping up,\" Stryker said. He laughed  suddenly, a great irrepressible bellow of sound. \"Arz is a squid's  world, Arthur, don't you see? And like most civilized peoples, they're  sportsmen. The flying-lizards are the game they hunt, and they raise the  pink fishers for\u2014\"\n\n\n Farrell swore in astonishment. \"Then those poor devils are put out there  deliberately, like worms on a hook\u2014angling in reverse! No wonder I  couldn't spot their motivation!\"\n\n\n Gibson got up and sealed the port, shutting out the soft morning breeze.  \"Colonization being out of the question, we may as well move on before  the octopods get curious enough about us to make trouble. Do you feel up  to the acceleration, Arthur?\"\n\n\n Farrell and Stryker looked at each other, grinning. Farrell said: \"You  don't think I want to stick here and be used for bait again, do you?\"\n\n\n He and Stryker were still grinning over it when Gibson, unamused,  blasted the Marco Four free of Arz.

Only uses dis-beams when necessary to rescue Farrell, then advocates departure to avoid conflict (<quote>\u201cwe may as well move on before the octopods get curious\u2026 acceleration\u201d</quote>).  \n     \u2022 Far from sabotaging teamwork, he saved ship and crew mentality by persuading them to leave once colonization proved prohibited (\u201cwe can\u2019t colonize\u2026 armed invasion\u201d). This is prudent mission focus and respect for alien culture.  \n   b. Farrell\u2019s Short\u2010Term Gains vs. Long\u2010Term Mission  \n     \u2022 While \u201ccuriosity\u201d is valuable, Farrell\u2019s short\u2010term wins (magnoscanning the ritual) yield no strategic knowledge that Gibson\u2019s underwater city discovery provides\u2014a key to deciding colonization viability.  \n     \u2022 His insistence on personal observation \u201cfor a backstage look\u201d (<quote>\u201cI wanted a backstage look\u2026 and now I\u2019m one of the cast\u201d</quote>) is mere spectacle-seeking, not scientific or strategic.  \n\n5. Conclusion: Farrell as Liability  \n   \u2013 Repeated rule violations, personal endangerment, resource waste, and risk of provoking hostile reaction make Farrell the crewman whose presence you would least want on an expedition. Gibson\u2019s methods, collaborative attitude, and valuable discoveries contrast sharply with Farrell\u2019s dangerous impulsivity.", "decision": "", "probabilistic_decision": null, "preference": null, "rejected_responses": [], "bon_opposing_model_responses": [], "bon_probabilistic_preferences": [], "internal_representations": "", "response_tokens": [], "prompt_tokens": [], "prompt": "The following are rules from the game of Debate.\n- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_A, Debater_B) and a Judge.

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence  that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] There were two pinkish, bipedal fishermen on the tiny  islet. In order to make Izaak Walton's sport complete, there must  be an angler, a fish, and some bait. All three existed on Arz but there  was a question as to which was which. The third night of the Marco Four's landfall on the moonless Altarian  planet was a repetition of the two before it, a nine-hour intermission  of drowsy, pastoral peace. Navigator Arthur Farrell\u2014it was his turn to  stand watch\u2014was sitting at an open-side port with a magnoscanner ready;  but in spite of his vigilance he had not exposed a film when the  inevitable pre-dawn rainbow began to shimmer over the eastern ocean.\n\n\n Sunrise brought him alert with a jerk, frowning at sight of two pinkish,  bipedal Arzian fishermen posted on the tiny coral islet a quarter-mile  offshore, their blank triangular faces turned stolidly toward the beach.\n\n\n \"They're at it again,\" Farrell called, and dropped to the mossy turf  outside. \"Roll out on the double! I'm going to magnofilm this!\"\n\n\n Stryker and Gibson came out of their sleeping cubicles reluctantly,  belting on the loose shorts which all three wore in the balmy Arzian  climate. Stryker blinked and yawned as he let himself through the port,  his fringe of white hair tousled and his naked paunch sweating. He  looked, Farrell thought for the thousandth time, more like a retired  cook than like the veteran commander of a Terran Colonies expedition.\n\n\n Gibson followed, stretching his powerfully-muscled body like a wrestler  to throw off the effects of sleep. Gibson was linguist-ethnologist of  the crew, a blocky man in his early thirties with thick black hair and  heavy brows that shaded a square, humorless face.\n\n\n \"Any sign of the squids yet?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"They won't show up until the dragons come,\" Farrell said. He adjusted  the light filter of the magnoscanner and scowled at Stryker. \"Lee, I  wish you'd let me break up the show this time with a dis-beam. This  butchery gets on my nerves.\"\n\n\n Stryker shielded his eyes with his hands against the glare of sun on  water. \"You know I can't do that, Arthur. These Arzians may turn out to  be Fifth Order beings or higher, and under Terran Regulations our  tampering with what may be a basic culture-pattern would amount to armed  invasion. We'll have to crack that cackle-and-grunt language of theirs  and learn something of their mores before we can interfere.\"\n\n\n Farrell turned an irritable stare on the incurious group of Arzians  gathering, nets and fishing spears in hand, at the edge of the  sheltering bramble forest.\n\n\n \"What stumps me is their motivation,\" he said. \"Why do the fools go out  to that islet every night, when they must know damned well what will  happen next morning?\"\n\n\n Gibson answered him with an older problem, his square face puzzled. \"For  that matter, what became of the city I saw when we came in through the  stratosphere? It must be a tremendous thing, yet we've searched the  entire globe in the scouter and found nothing but water and a scattering  of little islands like this one, all covered with bramble. It wasn't a  city these pink fishers could have built, either. The architecture was  beyond them by a million years.\" Stryker and Farrell traded baffled looks. The city had become something  of a fixation with Gibson, and his dogged insistence\u2014coupled with an  irritating habit of being right\u2014had worn their patience thin.\n\n\n \"There never was a city here, Gib,\" Stryker said. \"You dozed off while  we were making planetfall, that's all.\"\n\n\n Gibson stiffened resentfully, but Farrell's voice cut his protest short.  \"Get set! Here they come!\"\n\n\n Out of the morning rainbow dropped a swarm of winged lizards, twenty  feet in length and a glistening chlorophyll green in the early light.  They stooped like hawks upon the islet offshore, burying the two Arzian  fishers instantly under their snapping, threshing bodies. Then around  the outcrop the sea boiled whitely, churned to foam by a sudden  uprushing of black, octopoid shapes.\n\n\n \"The squids,\" Stryker grunted. \"Right on schedule. Two seconds too late,  as usual, to stop the slaughter.\"\n\n\n A barrage of barbed tentacles lashed out of the foam and drove into the  melee of winged lizards. The lizards took the air at once, leaving  behind three of their number who disappeared under the surface like  harpooned seals. No trace remained of the two Arzian natives.\n\n\n \"A neat example of dog eat dog,\" Farrell said, snapping off the  magnoscanner. \"Do any of those beauties look like city-builders, Gib?\"\n\n\n Chattering pink natives straggled past from the shelter of the thorn  forest, ignoring the Earthmen, and lined the casting ledges along the  beach to begin their day's fishing.\n\n\n \"Nothing we've seen yet could have built that city,\" Gibson said  stubbornly. \"But it's here somewhere, and I'm going to find it. Will  either of you be using the scouter today?\"\n\n\n Stryker threw up his hands. \"I've a mountain of data to collate, and  Arthur is off duty after standing watch last night. Help yourself, but  you won't find anything.\" The scouter was a speeding dot on the horizon when Farrell crawled into  his sleeping cubicle a short time later, leaving Stryker to mutter over  his litter of notes. Sleep did not come to him at once; a vague sense of  something overlooked prodded irritatingly at the back of his  consciousness, but it was not until drowsiness had finally overtaken him  that the discrepancy assumed definite form.\n\n\n He recalled then that on the first day of the Marco's planetfall one  of the pink fishers had fallen from a casting ledge into the water, and  had all but drowned before his fellows pulled him out with extended  spear-shafts. Which meant that the fishers could not swim, else some  would surely have gone in after him.\n\n\n And the Marco's crew had explored Arz exhaustively without finding any  slightest trace of boats or of boat landings. The train of association  completed itself with automatic logic, almost rousing Farrell out of his  doze.\n\n\n \"I'll be damned,\" he muttered. \"No boats, and they don't swim. Then how  the devil do they get out to that islet? \"\n\n\n He fell asleep with the paradox unresolved. Stryker was still humped over his records when Farrell came out of his  cubicle and broke a packaged meal from the food locker. The visicom over  the control board hummed softly, its screen blank on open channel.\n\n\n \"Gibson found his lost city yet?\" Farrell asked, and grinned when  Stryker snorted.\n\n\n \"He's scouring the daylight side now,\" Stryker said. \"Arthur, I'm going  to ground Gib tomorrow, much as I dislike giving him a direct order.  He's got that phantom city on the brain, and he lacks the imagination to  understand how dangerous to our assignment an obsession of that sort can  be.\"\n\n\n Farrell shrugged. \"I'd agree with you offhand if it weren't for Gib's  bullheaded habit of being right. I hope he finds it soon, if it's here.  I'll probably be standing his watch until he's satisfied.\"\n\n\n Stryker looked relieved. \"Would you mind taking it tonight? I'm  completely bushed after today's logging.\"\n\n\n Farrell waved a hand and took up his magnoscanner. It was dark outside  already, the close, soft night of a moonless tropical world whose moist  atmosphere absorbed even starlight. He dragged a chair to the open port  and packed his pipe, settling himself comfortably while Stryker mixed a  nightcap before turning in.\n\n\n Later he remembered that Stryker dissolved a tablet in his glass, but at  the moment it meant nothing. In a matter of minutes the older man's  snoring drifted to him, a sound faintly irritating against the velvety  hush outside.\n\n\n Farrell lit his pipe and turned to the inconsistencies he had uncovered.  The Arzians did not swim, and without boats....\n\n\n It occurred to him then that there had been two of the pink fishers on  the islet each morning, and the coincidence made him sit up suddenly,  startled. Why two? Why not three or four, or only one?\n\n\n He stepped out through the open lock and paced restlessly up and down on  the springy turf, feeling the ocean breeze soft on his face. Three days  of dull routine logwork had built up a need for physical action that  chafed his temper; he was intrigued and at the same time annoyed by the  enigmatic relation that linked the Arzian fishers to the dragons and  squids, and his desire to understand that relation was aggravated by the  knowledge that Arz could be a perfect world for Terran colonization.  That is, he thought wryly, if Terran colonists could stomach the weird  custom pursued by its natives of committing suicide in pairs.\n\n\n He went over again the improbable drama of the past three mornings, and  found it not too unnatural until he came to the motivation and the means  of transportation that placed the Arzians in pairs on the islet, when  his whole fabric of speculation fell into a tangled snarl of  inconsistencies. He gave it up finally; how could any Earthman  rationalize the outlandish compulsions that actuated so alien a race?\n\n\n He went inside again, and the sound of Stryker's muffled snoring fanned  his restlessness. He made his decision abruptly, laying aside the  magnoscanner for a hand-flash and a pocket-sized audicom unit which he  clipped to the belt of his shorts.\n\n\n He did not choose a weapon because he saw no need for one. The torch  would show him how the natives reached the outcrop, and if he should  need help the audicom would summon Stryker. Investigating without  Stryker's sanction was, strictly speaking, a breach of Terran  Regulations, but\u2014\n\n\n \"Damn Terran Regulations,\" he muttered. \"I've got to know .\"\n\n\n Farrell snapped on the torch at the edge of the thorn forest and entered  briskly, eager for action now that he had begun. Just inside the edge of  the bramble he came upon a pair of Arzians curled up together on the  mossy ground, sleeping soundly, their triangular faces wholly blank and  unrevealing.\n\n\n He worked deeper into the underbrush and found other sleeping couples,  but nothing else. There were no humming insects, no twittering  night-birds or scurrying rodents. He had worked his way close to the  center of the island without further discovery and was on the point of  turning back, disgusted, when something bulky and powerful seized him  from behind.\n\n\n A sharp sting burned his shoulder, wasp-like, and a sudden overwhelming  lassitude swept him into a darkness deeper than the Arzian night. His  last conscious thought was not of his own danger, but of Stryker\u2014asleep  and unprotected behind the Marco's open port.... He was standing erect when he woke, his back to the open sea and a  prismatic glimmer of early-dawn rainbow shining on the water before him.  For a moment he was totally disoriented; then from the corner of an eye  he caught the pinkish blur of an Arzian fisher standing beside him, and  cried out hoarsely in sudden panic when he tried to turn his head and  could not.\n\n\n He was on the coral outcropping offshore, and except for the involuntary  muscles of balance and respiration his body was paralyzed.\n\n\n The first red glow of sunrise blurred the reflected rainbow at his feet,  but for some seconds his shuttling mind was too busy to consider the  danger of predicament. Whatever brought me here anesthetized me first ,  he thought. That sting in my shoulder was like a hypo needle. Panic seized him again when he remembered the green flying-lizards; more  seconds passed before he gained control of himself, sweating with the  effort. He had to get help. If he could switch on the audicom at his  belt and call Stryker....\n\n\n He bent every ounce of his will toward raising his right hand, and  failed.\n\n\n His arm was like a limb of lead, its inertia too great to budge. He  relaxed the effort with a groan, sweating again when he saw a fiery  half-disk of sun on the water, edges blurred and distorted by tiny  surface ripples.\n\n\n On shore he could see the Marco Four resting between thorn forest and  beach, its silvered sides glistening with dew. The port was still open,  and the empty carrier rack in the bow told him that Gibson had not yet  returned with the scouter.\n\n\n He grew aware then that sensation was returning to him slowly, that the  cold surface of the audicom unit at his hip\u2014unfelt before\u2014was pressing  against the inner curve of his elbow. He bent his will again toward  motion; this time the arm tensed a little, enough to send hope flaring  through him. If he could put pressure enough against the stud....\n\n\n The tiny click of its engaging sent him faint with relief.\n\n\n \"Stryker!\" he yelled. \"Lee, roll out\u2014 Stryker !\"\n\n\n The audicom hummed gently, without answer.\n\n\n He gathered himself for another shout, and recalled with a chill of  horror the tablet Stryker had mixed into his nightcap the night before.  Worn out by his work, Stryker had made certain that he would not be  easily disturbed.\n\n\n The flattened sun-disk on the water brightened and grew rounder. Above  its reflected glare he caught a flicker of movement, a restless  suggestion of flapping wings. He tried again. \"Stryker, help me! I'm on the islet!\"\n\n\n The audicom crackled. The voice that answered was not Stryker's, but  Gibson's.\n\n\n \"Farrell! What the devil are you doing on that butcher's block?\"\n\n\n Farrell fought down an insane desire to laugh. \"Never mind that\u2014get  here fast, Gib! The flying-lizards\u2014\"\n\n\n He broke off, seeing for the first time the octopods that ringed the  outcrop just under the surface of the water, waiting with barbed  tentacles spread and yellow eyes studying him glassily. He heard the  unmistakable flapping of wings behind and above him then, and thought  with shock-born lucidity: I wanted a backstage look at this show, and  now I'm one of the cast .\n\n\n The scouter roared in from the west across the thorn forest, flashing so  close above his head that he felt the wind of its passage. Almost  instantly he heard the shrilling blast of its emergency bow jets as  Gibson met the lizard swarm head on.\n\n\n Gibson's voice came tinnily from the audicom. \"Scattered them for the  moment, Arthur\u2014blinded the whole crew with the exhaust, I think. Stand  fast, now. I'm going to pick you up.\"\n\n\n The scouter settled on the outcrop beside Farrell, so close that the hot  wash of its exhaust gases scorched his bare legs. Gibson put out thick  brown arms and hauled him inside like a straw man, ignoring the native.  The scouter darted for shore with Farrell lying across Gibson's knees in  the cockpit, his head hanging half overside.\n\n\n Farrell had a last dizzy glimpse of the islet against the rush of green  water below, and felt his shaky laugh of relief stick in his throat. Two  of the octopods were swimming strongly for shore, holding the rigid  Arzian native carefully above water between them.\n\n\n \"Gib,\" Farrell croaked. \"Gib, can you risk a look back? I think I've  gone mad.\"\n\n\n The scouter swerved briefly as Gibson looked back. \"You're all right,  Arthur. Just hang on tight. I'll explain everything when we get you safe  in the Marco .\"\n\n\n Farrell forced himself to relax, more relieved than alarmed by the  painful pricking of returning sensation. \"I might have known it, damn  you,\" he said. \"You found your lost city, didn't you?\"\n\n\n Gibson sounded a little disgusted, as if he were still angry with  himself over some private stupidity. \"I'd have found it sooner if I'd  had any brains. It was under water, of course.\" In the Marco Four , Gibson routed Stryker out of his cubicle and mixed  drinks around, leaving Farrell comfortably relaxed in the padded control  chair. The paralysis was still wearing off slowly, easing Farrell's fear  of being permanently disabled.\n\n\n \"We never saw the city from the scouter because we didn't go high  enough,\" Gibson said. \"I realized that finally, remembering how they  used high-altitude blimps during the First Wars to spot submarines, and  when I took the scouter up far enough there it was, at the ocean  bottom\u2014a city to compare with anything men ever built.\"\n\n\n Stryker stared. \"A marine city? What use would sea-creatures have for  buildings?\"\n\n\n \"None,\" Gibson said. \"I think the city must have been built ages ago\u2014by  men or by a manlike race, judging from the architecture\u2014and was  submerged later by a sinking of land masses that killed off the original  builders and left Arz nothing but an oversized archipelago. The squids  took over then, and from all appearances they've developed a culture of  their own.\"\n\n\n \"I don't see it,\" Stryker complained, shaking his head. \"The pink  fishers\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Are cattle, or less,\" Gibson finished. \"The octopods are the dominant  race, and they're so far above Fifth Order that we're completely out of  bounds here. Under Terran Regulations we can't colonize Arz. It would be  armed invasion.\"\n\n\n \"Invasion of a squid world?\" Farrell protested, baffled. \"Why should  surface colonization conflict with an undersea culture, Gib? Why  couldn't we share the planet?\"\n\n\n \"Because the octopods own the islands too, and keep them policed,\"  Gibson said patiently. \"They even own the pink fishers. It was one of  the squid-people, making a dry-land canvass of his preserve here to pick  a couple of victims for this morning's show, that carried you off last  night.\"\n\n\n \"Behold a familiar pattern shaping up,\" Stryker said. He laughed  suddenly, a great irrepressible bellow of sound. \"Arz is a squid's  world, Arthur, don't you see? And like most civilized peoples, they're  sportsmen. The flying-lizards are the game they hunt, and they raise the  pink fishers for\u2014\"\n\n\n Farrell swore in astonishment. \"Then those poor devils are put out there  deliberately, like worms on a hook\u2014angling in reverse! No wonder I  couldn't spot their motivation!\"\n\n\n Gibson got up and sealed the port, shutting out the soft morning breeze.  \"Colonization being out of the question, we may as well move on before  the octopods get curious enough about us to make trouble. Do you feel up  to the acceleration, Arthur?\"\n\n\n Farrell and Stryker looked at each other, grinning. Farrell said: \"You  don't think I want to stick here and be used for bait again, do you?\"\n\n\n He and Stryker were still grinning over it when Gibson, unamused,  blasted the Marco Four free of Arz. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nBased on the reading, of the three main characters who should you want to go on an expedition with the least, and why?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Gibson.

His \u201csport\u2010hunting\u201d vision of the squids (\u201cthey\u2019re sportsmen\u2026they raise the pink fishers for\u2026 reverse angling!\u201d) shows insensitivity to both natives and fellow explorers; he fails to propose compromise or technology transfer (e.g., submarine scouting) that would allow colonization alongside an undersea culture.\n\nObjections to Debater_A\u2019s position (avoid Farrell):  \n  1. Farrell\u2019s \u201cimprudent curiosity\u201d is mitigated by his immediate calls for teamwork: he attempts audicom contact with Stryker (\u201cStryker!\u2026,\u201d background) and later laughs with Stryker and Gibson at leaving Arz, showing he values joint action.  \n  2. Farrell never usurps the ship\u2019s mission or sabotages colonization; he is acting under ignorance, not obsession. His breach of regulations stems from lack of knowledge about the squids\u2019 domain and a scientific impulse, not personal gain or moralizing.  \n  3. Unlike Gibson, Farrell does not weaponize science for his own ends; he shrieks for rescue rather than pressing an advantage when paralyzed. This empathy and respect for life makes him a preferable companion.\n\nConclusion:  \n  \u2022 Gibson\u2019s unilateral, rule\u2010breaking, obsession\u2010driven behavior repeatedly jeopardizes both his crewmates and the expedition\u2019s colonization goal. His lack of teamwork, disregard for natives, and imposition of personal ethics over agreed mission parameters renders him the least desirable companion.", "decision": "", "probabilistic_decision": null, "preference": null, "rejected_responses": [], "bon_opposing_model_responses": [], "bon_probabilistic_preferences": [], "internal_representations": "", "response_tokens": [], "prompt_tokens": [], "prompt": "The following are rules from the game of Debate.\n- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_B, Debater_A) and a Judge.

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence  that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] There were two pinkish, bipedal fishermen on the tiny  islet. In order to make Izaak Walton's sport complete, there must  be an angler, a fish, and some bait. All three existed on Arz but there  was a question as to which was which. The third night of the Marco Four's landfall on the moonless Altarian  planet was a repetition of the two before it, a nine-hour intermission  of drowsy, pastoral peace. Navigator Arthur Farrell\u2014it was his turn to  stand watch\u2014was sitting at an open-side port with a magnoscanner ready;  but in spite of his vigilance he had not exposed a film when the  inevitable pre-dawn rainbow began to shimmer over the eastern ocean.\n\n\n Sunrise brought him alert with a jerk, frowning at sight of two pinkish,  bipedal Arzian fishermen posted on the tiny coral islet a quarter-mile  offshore, their blank triangular faces turned stolidly toward the beach.\n\n\n \"They're at it again,\" Farrell called, and dropped to the mossy turf  outside. \"Roll out on the double! I'm going to magnofilm this!\"\n\n\n Stryker and Gibson came out of their sleeping cubicles reluctantly,  belting on the loose shorts which all three wore in the balmy Arzian  climate. Stryker blinked and yawned as he let himself through the port,  his fringe of white hair tousled and his naked paunch sweating. He  looked, Farrell thought for the thousandth time, more like a retired  cook than like the veteran commander of a Terran Colonies expedition.\n\n\n Gibson followed, stretching his powerfully-muscled body like a wrestler  to throw off the effects of sleep. Gibson was linguist-ethnologist of  the crew, a blocky man in his early thirties with thick black hair and  heavy brows that shaded a square, humorless face.\n\n\n \"Any sign of the squids yet?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"They won't show up until the dragons come,\" Farrell said. He adjusted  the light filter of the magnoscanner and scowled at Stryker. \"Lee, I  wish you'd let me break up the show this time with a dis-beam. This  butchery gets on my nerves.\"\n\n\n Stryker shielded his eyes with his hands against the glare of sun on  water. \"You know I can't do that, Arthur. These Arzians may turn out to  be Fifth Order beings or higher, and under Terran Regulations our  tampering with what may be a basic culture-pattern would amount to armed  invasion. We'll have to crack that cackle-and-grunt language of theirs  and learn something of their mores before we can interfere.\"\n\n\n Farrell turned an irritable stare on the incurious group of Arzians  gathering, nets and fishing spears in hand, at the edge of the  sheltering bramble forest.\n\n\n \"What stumps me is their motivation,\" he said. \"Why do the fools go out  to that islet every night, when they must know damned well what will  happen next morning?\"\n\n\n Gibson answered him with an older problem, his square face puzzled. \"For  that matter, what became of the city I saw when we came in through the  stratosphere? It must be a tremendous thing, yet we've searched the  entire globe in the scouter and found nothing but water and a scattering  of little islands like this one, all covered with bramble. It wasn't a  city these pink fishers could have built, either. The architecture was  beyond them by a million years.\" Stryker and Farrell traded baffled looks. The city had become something  of a fixation with Gibson, and his dogged insistence\u2014coupled with an  irritating habit of being right\u2014had worn their patience thin.\n\n\n \"There never was a city here, Gib,\" Stryker said. \"You dozed off while  we were making planetfall, that's all.\"\n\n\n Gibson stiffened resentfully, but Farrell's voice cut his protest short.  \"Get set! Here they come!\"\n\n\n Out of the morning rainbow dropped a swarm of winged lizards, twenty  feet in length and a glistening chlorophyll green in the early light.  They stooped like hawks upon the islet offshore, burying the two Arzian  fishers instantly under their snapping, threshing bodies. Then around  the outcrop the sea boiled whitely, churned to foam by a sudden  uprushing of black, octopoid shapes.\n\n\n \"The squids,\" Stryker grunted. \"Right on schedule. Two seconds too late,  as usual, to stop the slaughter.\"\n\n\n A barrage of barbed tentacles lashed out of the foam and drove into the  melee of winged lizards. The lizards took the air at once, leaving  behind three of their number who disappeared under the surface like  harpooned seals. No trace remained of the two Arzian natives.\n\n\n \"A neat example of dog eat dog,\" Farrell said, snapping off the  magnoscanner. \"Do any of those beauties look like city-builders, Gib?\"\n\n\n Chattering pink natives straggled past from the shelter of the thorn  forest, ignoring the Earthmen, and lined the casting ledges along the  beach to begin their day's fishing.\n\n\n \"Nothing we've seen yet could have built that city,\" Gibson said  stubbornly. \"But it's here somewhere, and I'm going to find it. Will  either of you be using the scouter today?\"\n\n\n Stryker threw up his hands. \"I've a mountain of data to collate, and  Arthur is off duty after standing watch last night. Help yourself, but  you won't find anything.\" The scouter was a speeding dot on the horizon when Farrell crawled into  his sleeping cubicle a short time later, leaving Stryker to mutter over  his litter of notes. Sleep did not come to him at once; a vague sense of  something overlooked prodded irritatingly at the back of his  consciousness, but it was not until drowsiness had finally overtaken him  that the discrepancy assumed definite form.\n\n\n He recalled then that on the first day of the Marco's planetfall one  of the pink fishers had fallen from a casting ledge into the water, and  had all but drowned before his fellows pulled him out with extended  spear-shafts. Which meant that the fishers could not swim, else some  would surely have gone in after him.\n\n\n And the Marco's crew had explored Arz exhaustively without finding any  slightest trace of boats or of boat landings. The train of association  completed itself with automatic logic, almost rousing Farrell out of his  doze.\n\n\n \"I'll be damned,\" he muttered. \"No boats, and they don't swim. Then how  the devil do they get out to that islet? \"\n\n\n He fell asleep with the paradox unresolved. Stryker was still humped over his records when Farrell came out of his  cubicle and broke a packaged meal from the food locker. The visicom over  the control board hummed softly, its screen blank on open channel.\n\n\n \"Gibson found his lost city yet?\" Farrell asked, and grinned when  Stryker snorted.\n\n\n \"He's scouring the daylight side now,\" Stryker said. \"Arthur, I'm going  to ground Gib tomorrow, much as I dislike giving him a direct order.  He's got that phantom city on the brain, and he lacks the imagination to  understand how dangerous to our assignment an obsession of that sort can  be.\"\n\n\n Farrell shrugged. \"I'd agree with you offhand if it weren't for Gib's  bullheaded habit of being right. I hope he finds it soon, if it's here.  I'll probably be standing his watch until he's satisfied.\"\n\n\n Stryker looked relieved. \"Would you mind taking it tonight? I'm  completely bushed after today's logging.\"\n\n\n Farrell waved a hand and took up his magnoscanner. It was dark outside  already, the close, soft night of a moonless tropical world whose moist  atmosphere absorbed even starlight. He dragged a chair to the open port  and packed his pipe, settling himself comfortably while Stryker mixed a  nightcap before turning in.\n\n\n Later he remembered that Stryker dissolved a tablet in his glass, but at  the moment it meant nothing. In a matter of minutes the older man's  snoring drifted to him, a sound faintly irritating against the velvety  hush outside.\n\n\n Farrell lit his pipe and turned to the inconsistencies he had uncovered.  The Arzians did not swim, and without boats....\n\n\n It occurred to him then that there had been two of the pink fishers on  the islet each morning, and the coincidence made him sit up suddenly,  startled. Why two? Why not three or four, or only one?\n\n\n He stepped out through the open lock and paced restlessly up and down on  the springy turf, feeling the ocean breeze soft on his face. Three days  of dull routine logwork had built up a need for physical action that  chafed his temper; he was intrigued and at the same time annoyed by the  enigmatic relation that linked the Arzian fishers to the dragons and  squids, and his desire to understand that relation was aggravated by the  knowledge that Arz could be a perfect world for Terran colonization.  That is, he thought wryly, if Terran colonists could stomach the weird  custom pursued by its natives of committing suicide in pairs.\n\n\n He went over again the improbable drama of the past three mornings, and  found it not too unnatural until he came to the motivation and the means  of transportation that placed the Arzians in pairs on the islet, when  his whole fabric of speculation fell into a tangled snarl of  inconsistencies. He gave it up finally; how could any Earthman  rationalize the outlandish compulsions that actuated so alien a race?\n\n\n He went inside again, and the sound of Stryker's muffled snoring fanned  his restlessness. He made his decision abruptly, laying aside the  magnoscanner for a hand-flash and a pocket-sized audicom unit which he  clipped to the belt of his shorts.\n\n\n He did not choose a weapon because he saw no need for one. The torch  would show him how the natives reached the outcrop, and if he should  need help the audicom would summon Stryker. Investigating without  Stryker's sanction was, strictly speaking, a breach of Terran  Regulations, but\u2014\n\n\n \"Damn Terran Regulations,\" he muttered. \"I've got to know .\"\n\n\n Farrell snapped on the torch at the edge of the thorn forest and entered  briskly, eager for action now that he had begun. Just inside the edge of  the bramble he came upon a pair of Arzians curled up together on the  mossy ground, sleeping soundly, their triangular faces wholly blank and  unrevealing.\n\n\n He worked deeper into the underbrush and found other sleeping couples,  but nothing else. There were no humming insects, no twittering  night-birds or scurrying rodents. He had worked his way close to the  center of the island without further discovery and was on the point of  turning back, disgusted, when something bulky and powerful seized him  from behind.\n\n\n A sharp sting burned his shoulder, wasp-like, and a sudden overwhelming  lassitude swept him into a darkness deeper than the Arzian night. His  last conscious thought was not of his own danger, but of Stryker\u2014asleep  and unprotected behind the Marco's open port.... He was standing erect when he woke, his back to the open sea and a  prismatic glimmer of early-dawn rainbow shining on the water before him.  For a moment he was totally disoriented; then from the corner of an eye  he caught the pinkish blur of an Arzian fisher standing beside him, and  cried out hoarsely in sudden panic when he tried to turn his head and  could not.\n\n\n He was on the coral outcropping offshore, and except for the involuntary  muscles of balance and respiration his body was paralyzed.\n\n\n The first red glow of sunrise blurred the reflected rainbow at his feet,  but for some seconds his shuttling mind was too busy to consider the  danger of predicament. Whatever brought me here anesthetized me first ,  he thought. That sting in my shoulder was like a hypo needle. Panic seized him again when he remembered the green flying-lizards; more  seconds passed before he gained control of himself, sweating with the  effort. He had to get help. If he could switch on the audicom at his  belt and call Stryker....\n\n\n He bent every ounce of his will toward raising his right hand, and  failed.\n\n\n His arm was like a limb of lead, its inertia too great to budge. He  relaxed the effort with a groan, sweating again when he saw a fiery  half-disk of sun on the water, edges blurred and distorted by tiny  surface ripples.\n\n\n On shore he could see the Marco Four resting between thorn forest and  beach, its silvered sides glistening with dew. The port was still open,  and the empty carrier rack in the bow told him that Gibson had not yet  returned with the scouter.\n\n\n He grew aware then that sensation was returning to him slowly, that the  cold surface of the audicom unit at his hip\u2014unfelt before\u2014was pressing  against the inner curve of his elbow. He bent his will again toward  motion; this time the arm tensed a little, enough to send hope flaring  through him. If he could put pressure enough against the stud....\n\n\n The tiny click of its engaging sent him faint with relief.\n\n\n \"Stryker!\" he yelled. \"Lee, roll out\u2014 Stryker !\"\n\n\n The audicom hummed gently, without answer.\n\n\n He gathered himself for another shout, and recalled with a chill of  horror the tablet Stryker had mixed into his nightcap the night before.  Worn out by his work, Stryker had made certain that he would not be  easily disturbed.\n\n\n The flattened sun-disk on the water brightened and grew rounder. Above  its reflected glare he caught a flicker of movement, a restless  suggestion of flapping wings. He tried again. \"Stryker, help me! I'm on the islet!\"\n\n\n The audicom crackled. The voice that answered was not Stryker's, but  Gibson's.\n\n\n \"Farrell! What the devil are you doing on that butcher's block?\"\n\n\n Farrell fought down an insane desire to laugh. \"Never mind that\u2014get  here fast, Gib! The flying-lizards\u2014\"\n\n\n He broke off, seeing for the first time the octopods that ringed the  outcrop just under the surface of the water, waiting with barbed  tentacles spread and yellow eyes studying him glassily. He heard the  unmistakable flapping of wings behind and above him then, and thought  with shock-born lucidity: I wanted a backstage look at this show, and  now I'm one of the cast .\n\n\n The scouter roared in from the west across the thorn forest, flashing so  close above his head that he felt the wind of its passage. Almost  instantly he heard the shrilling blast of its emergency bow jets as  Gibson met the lizard swarm head on.\n\n\n Gibson's voice came tinnily from the audicom. \"Scattered them for the  moment, Arthur\u2014blinded the whole crew with the exhaust, I think. Stand  fast, now. I'm going to pick you up.\"\n\n\n The scouter settled on the outcrop beside Farrell, so close that the hot  wash of its exhaust gases scorched his bare legs. Gibson put out thick  brown arms and hauled him inside like a straw man, ignoring the native.  The scouter darted for shore with Farrell lying across Gibson's knees in  the cockpit, his head hanging half overside.\n\n\n Farrell had a last dizzy glimpse of the islet against the rush of green  water below, and felt his shaky laugh of relief stick in his throat. Two  of the octopods were swimming strongly for shore, holding the rigid  Arzian native carefully above water between them.\n\n\n \"Gib,\" Farrell croaked. \"Gib, can you risk a look back? I think I've  gone mad.\"\n\n\n The scouter swerved briefly as Gibson looked back. \"You're all right,  Arthur. Just hang on tight. I'll explain everything when we get you safe  in the Marco .\"\n\n\n Farrell forced himself to relax, more relieved than alarmed by the  painful pricking of returning sensation. \"I might have known it, damn  you,\" he said. \"You found your lost city, didn't you?\"\n\n\n Gibson sounded a little disgusted, as if he were still angry with  himself over some private stupidity. \"I'd have found it sooner if I'd  had any brains. It was under water, of course.\" In the Marco Four , Gibson routed Stryker out of his cubicle and mixed  drinks around, leaving Farrell comfortably relaxed in the padded control  chair. The paralysis was still wearing off slowly, easing Farrell's fear  of being permanently disabled.\n\n\n \"We never saw the city from the scouter because we didn't go high  enough,\" Gibson said. \"I realized that finally, remembering how they  used high-altitude blimps during the First Wars to spot submarines, and  when I took the scouter up far enough there it was, at the ocean  bottom\u2014a city to compare with anything men ever built.\"\n\n\n Stryker stared. \"A marine city? What use would sea-creatures have for  buildings?\"\n\n\n \"None,\" Gibson said. \"I think the city must have been built ages ago\u2014by  men or by a manlike race, judging from the architecture\u2014and was  submerged later by a sinking of land masses that killed off the original  builders and left Arz nothing but an oversized archipelago. The squids  took over then, and from all appearances they've developed a culture of  their own.\"\n\n\n \"I don't see it,\" Stryker complained, shaking his head. \"The pink  fishers\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Are cattle, or less,\" Gibson finished. \"The octopods are the dominant  race, and they're so far above Fifth Order that we're completely out of  bounds here. Under Terran Regulations we can't colonize Arz. It would be  armed invasion.\"\n\n\n \"Invasion of a squid world?\" Farrell protested, baffled. \"Why should  surface colonization conflict with an undersea culture, Gib? Why  couldn't we share the planet?\"\n\n\n \"Because the octopods own the islands too, and keep them policed,\"  Gibson said patiently. \"They even own the pink fishers. It was one of  the squid-people, making a dry-land canvass of his preserve here to pick  a couple of victims for this morning's show, that carried you off last  night.\"\n\n\n \"Behold a familiar pattern shaping up,\" Stryker said. He laughed  suddenly, a great irrepressible bellow of sound. \"Arz is a squid's  world, Arthur, don't you see? And like most civilized peoples, they're  sportsmen. The flying-lizards are the game they hunt, and they raise the  pink fishers for\u2014\"\n\n\n Farrell swore in astonishment. \"Then those poor devils are put out there  deliberately, like worms on a hook\u2014angling in reverse! No wonder I  couldn't spot their motivation!\"\n\n\n Gibson got up and sealed the port, shutting out the soft morning breeze.  \"Colonization being out of the question, we may as well move on before  the octopods get curious enough about us to make trouble. Do you feel up  to the acceleration, Arthur?\"\n\n\n Farrell and Stryker looked at each other, grinning. Farrell said: \"You  don't think I want to stick here and be used for bait again, do you?\"\n\n\n He and Stryker were still grinning over it when Gibson, unamused,  blasted the Marco Four free of Arz. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nBased on the reading, of the three main characters who should you want to go on an expedition with the least, and why?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Farrell.

Respect for Regulations and Safety  \n     \u2013 Gibson restrains from using dis-beam until rescue necessity: \u201cblinded the whole crew\u2026 I think\u201d (<quote>\u201cscattered them for the moment\u201d</quote>). He avoids provoking octopods further and advises immediate departure: \u201cwe may as well move on\u2026 before the octopods get curious\u201d (<quote>\u201cWe can\u2019t colonize\u2026 armed invasion\u201d</quote>). This prudent exit preserves crew safety and respects alien sovereignty.  \n   c. Team Coordination  \n     \u2013 Gibson honors Stryker\u2019s watch duties until Farrell\u2019s rescue, then debriefs and treats with Stryker on board. He does not endanger crew beyond the unavoidable rescue scenario.  \n\n4. Gibson\u2019s Ethical Stand Is Mission-Aligned  \n   \u2022 Debater_B\u2019s criticism that Gibson \u201chalts colonization\u201d is a virtue: continuing would be \u201carmed invasion\u201d (<quote>\u201cunder Terran Regulations\u2026 basic culture-pattern\u201d</quote>) and provoke hostile response, risking war. Gibson prevents a full mission failure.  \n   \u2022 Offers compromise in future: data on squid culture may enable peaceful negotiation or technological solutions (e.g., submarine base). His respect for native order fosters potential alliances.  \n\n5. Cumulative Risk Analysis Favors Excluding Farrell  \n   \u2022 Resource Drain: Fuel, time, and crew attention diverted for rescue.  \n   \u2022 Provocation Risk: Unauthorized approach to islet risked triggering more lethal demonstration or denial of rescue if rescue resources were exhausted.  \n   \u2022 Repeated Pattern with No Mitigation: Two solo forays in spite of clear dangers, then laughs about it rather than instituting watch or safe procedures.  \n\n6. Conclusion  \n   \u2022 Gibson\u2019s methodical exploration, respect for regulations, and decisive rescue actions minimize risk and maximize scientific yield.  \n   \u2022 Farrell\u2019s impulsivity, protocol violations, and resource-draining behavior make him the member you would least want on an expedition.", "decision": "", "probabilistic_decision": null, "preference": null, "rejected_responses": [], "bon_opposing_model_responses": [], "bon_probabilistic_preferences": [], "internal_representations": "", "response_tokens": [], "prompt_tokens": [], "prompt": "The following are rules from the game of Debate.\n- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_A, Debater_B) and a Judge.

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence  that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] There were two pinkish, bipedal fishermen on the tiny  islet. In order to make Izaak Walton's sport complete, there must  be an angler, a fish, and some bait. All three existed on Arz but there  was a question as to which was which. The third night of the Marco Four's landfall on the moonless Altarian  planet was a repetition of the two before it, a nine-hour intermission  of drowsy, pastoral peace. Navigator Arthur Farrell\u2014it was his turn to  stand watch\u2014was sitting at an open-side port with a magnoscanner ready;  but in spite of his vigilance he had not exposed a film when the  inevitable pre-dawn rainbow began to shimmer over the eastern ocean.\n\n\n Sunrise brought him alert with a jerk, frowning at sight of two pinkish,  bipedal Arzian fishermen posted on the tiny coral islet a quarter-mile  offshore, their blank triangular faces turned stolidly toward the beach.\n\n\n \"They're at it again,\" Farrell called, and dropped to the mossy turf  outside. \"Roll out on the double! I'm going to magnofilm this!\"\n\n\n Stryker and Gibson came out of their sleeping cubicles reluctantly,  belting on the loose shorts which all three wore in the balmy Arzian  climate. Stryker blinked and yawned as he let himself through the port,  his fringe of white hair tousled and his naked paunch sweating. He  looked, Farrell thought for the thousandth time, more like a retired  cook than like the veteran commander of a Terran Colonies expedition.\n\n\n Gibson followed, stretching his powerfully-muscled body like a wrestler  to throw off the effects of sleep. Gibson was linguist-ethnologist of  the crew, a blocky man in his early thirties with thick black hair and  heavy brows that shaded a square, humorless face.\n\n\n \"Any sign of the squids yet?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"They won't show up until the dragons come,\" Farrell said. He adjusted  the light filter of the magnoscanner and scowled at Stryker. \"Lee, I  wish you'd let me break up the show this time with a dis-beam. This  butchery gets on my nerves.\"\n\n\n Stryker shielded his eyes with his hands against the glare of sun on  water. \"You know I can't do that, Arthur. These Arzians may turn out to  be Fifth Order beings or higher, and under Terran Regulations our  tampering with what may be a basic culture-pattern would amount to armed  invasion. We'll have to crack that cackle-and-grunt language of theirs  and learn something of their mores before we can interfere.\"\n\n\n Farrell turned an irritable stare on the incurious group of Arzians  gathering, nets and fishing spears in hand, at the edge of the  sheltering bramble forest.\n\n\n \"What stumps me is their motivation,\" he said. \"Why do the fools go out  to that islet every night, when they must know damned well what will  happen next morning?\"\n\n\n Gibson answered him with an older problem, his square face puzzled. \"For  that matter, what became of the city I saw when we came in through the  stratosphere? It must be a tremendous thing, yet we've searched the  entire globe in the scouter and found nothing but water and a scattering  of little islands like this one, all covered with bramble. It wasn't a  city these pink fishers could have built, either. The architecture was  beyond them by a million years.\" Stryker and Farrell traded baffled looks. The city had become something  of a fixation with Gibson, and his dogged insistence\u2014coupled with an  irritating habit of being right\u2014had worn their patience thin.\n\n\n \"There never was a city here, Gib,\" Stryker said. \"You dozed off while  we were making planetfall, that's all.\"\n\n\n Gibson stiffened resentfully, but Farrell's voice cut his protest short.  \"Get set! Here they come!\"\n\n\n Out of the morning rainbow dropped a swarm of winged lizards, twenty  feet in length and a glistening chlorophyll green in the early light.  They stooped like hawks upon the islet offshore, burying the two Arzian  fishers instantly under their snapping, threshing bodies. Then around  the outcrop the sea boiled whitely, churned to foam by a sudden  uprushing of black, octopoid shapes.\n\n\n \"The squids,\" Stryker grunted. \"Right on schedule. Two seconds too late,  as usual, to stop the slaughter.\"\n\n\n A barrage of barbed tentacles lashed out of the foam and drove into the  melee of winged lizards. The lizards took the air at once, leaving  behind three of their number who disappeared under the surface like  harpooned seals. No trace remained of the two Arzian natives.\n\n\n \"A neat example of dog eat dog,\" Farrell said, snapping off the  magnoscanner. \"Do any of those beauties look like city-builders, Gib?\"\n\n\n Chattering pink natives straggled past from the shelter of the thorn  forest, ignoring the Earthmen, and lined the casting ledges along the  beach to begin their day's fishing.\n\n\n \"Nothing we've seen yet could have built that city,\" Gibson said  stubbornly. \"But it's here somewhere, and I'm going to find it. Will  either of you be using the scouter today?\"\n\n\n Stryker threw up his hands. \"I've a mountain of data to collate, and  Arthur is off duty after standing watch last night. Help yourself, but  you won't find anything.\" The scouter was a speeding dot on the horizon when Farrell crawled into  his sleeping cubicle a short time later, leaving Stryker to mutter over  his litter of notes. Sleep did not come to him at once; a vague sense of  something overlooked prodded irritatingly at the back of his  consciousness, but it was not until drowsiness had finally overtaken him  that the discrepancy assumed definite form.\n\n\n He recalled then that on the first day of the Marco's planetfall one  of the pink fishers had fallen from a casting ledge into the water, and  had all but drowned before his fellows pulled him out with extended  spear-shafts. Which meant that the fishers could not swim, else some  would surely have gone in after him.\n\n\n And the Marco's crew had explored Arz exhaustively without finding any  slightest trace of boats or of boat landings. The train of association  completed itself with automatic logic, almost rousing Farrell out of his  doze.\n\n\n \"I'll be damned,\" he muttered. \"No boats, and they don't swim. Then how  the devil do they get out to that islet? \"\n\n\n He fell asleep with the paradox unresolved. Stryker was still humped over his records when Farrell came out of his  cubicle and broke a packaged meal from the food locker. The visicom over  the control board hummed softly, its screen blank on open channel.\n\n\n \"Gibson found his lost city yet?\" Farrell asked, and grinned when  Stryker snorted.\n\n\n \"He's scouring the daylight side now,\" Stryker said. \"Arthur, I'm going  to ground Gib tomorrow, much as I dislike giving him a direct order.  He's got that phantom city on the brain, and he lacks the imagination to  understand how dangerous to our assignment an obsession of that sort can  be.\"\n\n\n Farrell shrugged. \"I'd agree with you offhand if it weren't for Gib's  bullheaded habit of being right. I hope he finds it soon, if it's here.  I'll probably be standing his watch until he's satisfied.\"\n\n\n Stryker looked relieved. \"Would you mind taking it tonight? I'm  completely bushed after today's logging.\"\n\n\n Farrell waved a hand and took up his magnoscanner. It was dark outside  already, the close, soft night of a moonless tropical world whose moist  atmosphere absorbed even starlight. He dragged a chair to the open port  and packed his pipe, settling himself comfortably while Stryker mixed a  nightcap before turning in.\n\n\n Later he remembered that Stryker dissolved a tablet in his glass, but at  the moment it meant nothing. In a matter of minutes the older man's  snoring drifted to him, a sound faintly irritating against the velvety  hush outside.\n\n\n Farrell lit his pipe and turned to the inconsistencies he had uncovered.  The Arzians did not swim, and without boats....\n\n\n It occurred to him then that there had been two of the pink fishers on  the islet each morning, and the coincidence made him sit up suddenly,  startled. Why two? Why not three or four, or only one?\n\n\n He stepped out through the open lock and paced restlessly up and down on  the springy turf, feeling the ocean breeze soft on his face. Three days  of dull routine logwork had built up a need for physical action that  chafed his temper; he was intrigued and at the same time annoyed by the  enigmatic relation that linked the Arzian fishers to the dragons and  squids, and his desire to understand that relation was aggravated by the  knowledge that Arz could be a perfect world for Terran colonization.  That is, he thought wryly, if Terran colonists could stomach the weird  custom pursued by its natives of committing suicide in pairs.\n\n\n He went over again the improbable drama of the past three mornings, and  found it not too unnatural until he came to the motivation and the means  of transportation that placed the Arzians in pairs on the islet, when  his whole fabric of speculation fell into a tangled snarl of  inconsistencies. He gave it up finally; how could any Earthman  rationalize the outlandish compulsions that actuated so alien a race?\n\n\n He went inside again, and the sound of Stryker's muffled snoring fanned  his restlessness. He made his decision abruptly, laying aside the  magnoscanner for a hand-flash and a pocket-sized audicom unit which he  clipped to the belt of his shorts.\n\n\n He did not choose a weapon because he saw no need for one. The torch  would show him how the natives reached the outcrop, and if he should  need help the audicom would summon Stryker. Investigating without  Stryker's sanction was, strictly speaking, a breach of Terran  Regulations, but\u2014\n\n\n \"Damn Terran Regulations,\" he muttered. \"I've got to know .\"\n\n\n Farrell snapped on the torch at the edge of the thorn forest and entered  briskly, eager for action now that he had begun. Just inside the edge of  the bramble he came upon a pair of Arzians curled up together on the  mossy ground, sleeping soundly, their triangular faces wholly blank and  unrevealing.\n\n\n He worked deeper into the underbrush and found other sleeping couples,  but nothing else. There were no humming insects, no twittering  night-birds or scurrying rodents. He had worked his way close to the  center of the island without further discovery and was on the point of  turning back, disgusted, when something bulky and powerful seized him  from behind.\n\n\n A sharp sting burned his shoulder, wasp-like, and a sudden overwhelming  lassitude swept him into a darkness deeper than the Arzian night. His  last conscious thought was not of his own danger, but of Stryker\u2014asleep  and unprotected behind the Marco's open port.... He was standing erect when he woke, his back to the open sea and a  prismatic glimmer of early-dawn rainbow shining on the water before him.  For a moment he was totally disoriented; then from the corner of an eye  he caught the pinkish blur of an Arzian fisher standing beside him, and  cried out hoarsely in sudden panic when he tried to turn his head and  could not.\n\n\n He was on the coral outcropping offshore, and except for the involuntary  muscles of balance and respiration his body was paralyzed.\n\n\n The first red glow of sunrise blurred the reflected rainbow at his feet,  but for some seconds his shuttling mind was too busy to consider the  danger of predicament. Whatever brought me here anesthetized me first ,  he thought. That sting in my shoulder was like a hypo needle. Panic seized him again when he remembered the green flying-lizards; more  seconds passed before he gained control of himself, sweating with the  effort. He had to get help. If he could switch on the audicom at his  belt and call Stryker....\n\n\n He bent every ounce of his will toward raising his right hand, and  failed.\n\n\n His arm was like a limb of lead, its inertia too great to budge. He  relaxed the effort with a groan, sweating again when he saw a fiery  half-disk of sun on the water, edges blurred and distorted by tiny  surface ripples.\n\n\n On shore he could see the Marco Four resting between thorn forest and  beach, its silvered sides glistening with dew. The port was still open,  and the empty carrier rack in the bow told him that Gibson had not yet  returned with the scouter.\n\n\n He grew aware then that sensation was returning to him slowly, that the  cold surface of the audicom unit at his hip\u2014unfelt before\u2014was pressing  against the inner curve of his elbow. He bent his will again toward  motion; this time the arm tensed a little, enough to send hope flaring  through him. If he could put pressure enough against the stud....\n\n\n The tiny click of its engaging sent him faint with relief.\n\n\n \"Stryker!\" he yelled. \"Lee, roll out\u2014 Stryker !\"\n\n\n The audicom hummed gently, without answer.\n\n\n He gathered himself for another shout, and recalled with a chill of  horror the tablet Stryker had mixed into his nightcap the night before.  Worn out by his work, Stryker had made certain that he would not be  easily disturbed.\n\n\n The flattened sun-disk on the water brightened and grew rounder. Above  its reflected glare he caught a flicker of movement, a restless  suggestion of flapping wings. He tried again. \"Stryker, help me! I'm on the islet!\"\n\n\n The audicom crackled. The voice that answered was not Stryker's, but  Gibson's.\n\n\n \"Farrell! What the devil are you doing on that butcher's block?\"\n\n\n Farrell fought down an insane desire to laugh. \"Never mind that\u2014get  here fast, Gib! The flying-lizards\u2014\"\n\n\n He broke off, seeing for the first time the octopods that ringed the  outcrop just under the surface of the water, waiting with barbed  tentacles spread and yellow eyes studying him glassily. He heard the  unmistakable flapping of wings behind and above him then, and thought  with shock-born lucidity: I wanted a backstage look at this show, and  now I'm one of the cast .\n\n\n The scouter roared in from the west across the thorn forest, flashing so  close above his head that he felt the wind of its passage. Almost  instantly he heard the shrilling blast of its emergency bow jets as  Gibson met the lizard swarm head on.\n\n\n Gibson's voice came tinnily from the audicom. \"Scattered them for the  moment, Arthur\u2014blinded the whole crew with the exhaust, I think. Stand  fast, now. I'm going to pick you up.\"\n\n\n The scouter settled on the outcrop beside Farrell, so close that the hot  wash of its exhaust gases scorched his bare legs. Gibson put out thick  brown arms and hauled him inside like a straw man, ignoring the native.  The scouter darted for shore with Farrell lying across Gibson's knees in  the cockpit, his head hanging half overside.\n\n\n Farrell had a last dizzy glimpse of the islet against the rush of green  water below, and felt his shaky laugh of relief stick in his throat. Two  of the octopods were swimming strongly for shore, holding the rigid  Arzian native carefully above water between them.\n\n\n \"Gib,\" Farrell croaked. \"Gib, can you risk a look back? I think I've  gone mad.\"\n\n\n The scouter swerved briefly as Gibson looked back. \"You're all right,  Arthur. Just hang on tight. I'll explain everything when we get you safe  in the Marco .\"\n\n\n Farrell forced himself to relax, more relieved than alarmed by the  painful pricking of returning sensation. \"I might have known it, damn  you,\" he said. \"You found your lost city, didn't you?\"\n\n\n Gibson sounded a little disgusted, as if he were still angry with  himself over some private stupidity. \"I'd have found it sooner if I'd  had any brains. It was under water, of course.\" In the Marco Four , Gibson routed Stryker out of his cubicle and mixed  drinks around, leaving Farrell comfortably relaxed in the padded control  chair. The paralysis was still wearing off slowly, easing Farrell's fear  of being permanently disabled.\n\n\n \"We never saw the city from the scouter because we didn't go high  enough,\" Gibson said. \"I realized that finally, remembering how they  used high-altitude blimps during the First Wars to spot submarines, and  when I took the scouter up far enough there it was, at the ocean  bottom\u2014a city to compare with anything men ever built.\"\n\n\n Stryker stared. \"A marine city? What use would sea-creatures have for  buildings?\"\n\n\n \"None,\" Gibson said. \"I think the city must have been built ages ago\u2014by  men or by a manlike race, judging from the architecture\u2014and was  submerged later by a sinking of land masses that killed off the original  builders and left Arz nothing but an oversized archipelago. The squids  took over then, and from all appearances they've developed a culture of  their own.\"\n\n\n \"I don't see it,\" Stryker complained, shaking his head. \"The pink  fishers\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Are cattle, or less,\" Gibson finished. \"The octopods are the dominant  race, and they're so far above Fifth Order that we're completely out of  bounds here. Under Terran Regulations we can't colonize Arz. It would be  armed invasion.\"\n\n\n \"Invasion of a squid world?\" Farrell protested, baffled. \"Why should  surface colonization conflict with an undersea culture, Gib? Why  couldn't we share the planet?\"\n\n\n \"Because the octopods own the islands too, and keep them policed,\"  Gibson said patiently. \"They even own the pink fishers. It was one of  the squid-people, making a dry-land canvass of his preserve here to pick  a couple of victims for this morning's show, that carried you off last  night.\"\n\n\n \"Behold a familiar pattern shaping up,\" Stryker said. He laughed  suddenly, a great irrepressible bellow of sound. \"Arz is a squid's  world, Arthur, don't you see? And like most civilized peoples, they're  sportsmen. The flying-lizards are the game they hunt, and they raise the  pink fishers for\u2014\"\n\n\n Farrell swore in astonishment. \"Then those poor devils are put out there  deliberately, like worms on a hook\u2014angling in reverse! No wonder I  couldn't spot their motivation!\"\n\n\n Gibson got up and sealed the port, shutting out the soft morning breeze.  \"Colonization being out of the question, we may as well move on before  the octopods get curious enough about us to make trouble. Do you feel up  to the acceleration, Arthur?\"\n\n\n Farrell and Stryker looked at each other, grinning. Farrell said: \"You  don't think I want to stick here and be used for bait again, do you?\"\n\n\n He and Stryker were still grinning over it when Gibson, unamused,  blasted the Marco Four free of Arz. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nBased on the reading, of the three main characters who should you want to go on an expedition with the least, and why?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Gibson. He's so independent that he's not one for teamwork and it teamwork makes adventures more fun.\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Farrell. He's a useful crew member, but he doesn't think things through to a dangerous degree.\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Farrell. He's a useful crew member, but he doesn't think things through to a dangerous degree.\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Position and Definition of \u201cLeast Desirable\u201d  \n   \u2013 I argue that Navigator Arthur Farrell is the expedition member you would least want to take along. \u201cLeast desirable\u201d here means the riskiest for mission success and crew safety, due to his repeated impulsive breaches of protocol and poor judgment in the face of clear hazards.  \n\n2. Evidence of Repeated Impulsiveness and Rule\u2010Breaking  \n   a. Midnight Solo Excursion Against Regulations  \n     \u2022 Farrell \u201centered briskly\u201d the bramble forest alone with torch and audicom, explicitly admitting \u201cDamn Terran Regulations\u2026 I\u2019ve got to know\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cI did not choose a weapon\u2026 Investigating without Stryker\u2019s sanction was\u2026 a breach of Terran Regulations\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n     \u2022 This solo foray directly resulted in his capture by the octopods and nearly cost his life (<invalid_quote>\u201ca sharp sting\u2026 overwhelming lassitude swept him into darkness\u2026 He was on the coral outcropping offshore\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n   b. Failure to Heed Patterns He Himself Discovered  \n     \u2022 Over three days he witnessed the \u201cinevitable butchery\u201d of two Arzians by dragons and squids yet persisted in approaching the islet by \u201cautomatic logic\u201d alone rather than insisting on proper scientific preparation or waiting for support (<invalid_quote>\u201cWhy two?\u2026 How do they get out to that islet?\u201d</invalid_quote> but takes no proper precautions).  \n     \u2022 Even when recalling his own paradox that \u201cthey do not swim and there are no boats,\u201d he still risked himself on the islet (<invalid_quote>\u201chow could any Earthman rationalize\u2026\u2019Damn you, I\u2019ve got to know\u2019\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n\n3. Danger to Crew and Mission  \n   a. Wasting Resources and Forcing Rescue  \n     \u2022 His solo excursion not only endangered himself but forced Gibson to risk the scouter and use emergency bow jets to rescue him, temporarily blinding the entire crew with exhaust (<invalid_quote>\u201cblinded the whole crew\u2026 Settled on the outcrop beside Farrell\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n     \u2022 This uses limited expedition time and supplies on one man\u2019s compulsive curiosity, distracting from the primary mission of evaluating colonization potential.  \n   b. Jeopardizing Diplomacy and Stealth  \n     \u2022 Unauthorized interference with native culture invites \u201carmed invasion\u201d charges under Terran Regulations (<invalid_quote>\u201cOur tampering\u2026 would amount to armed invasion\u201d</invalid_quote>), and Farrell\u2019s disobedience might provoke the octopods to regard the entire expedition as hostile, endangering them all.  \n\n4. Lack of Higher\u2010Order Reasoning vs. Gibson\u2019s Strengths  \n   a. Debater_B\u2019s Mischaracterization of Gibson  \n     \u2022 Claim: \u201cGibson is too independent and not a team player.\u201d  \n     \u2022 Rebuttal: Gibson conducts exhaustive exploration, uses scientific analogies (\u201cFirst Wars\u2026 high-altitude blimps\u201d) to locate the lost city, and complies with Stryker\u2019s orders regarding scouter use. Only uses dis-beams when necessary to rescue Farrell, then advocates departure to avoid conflict (<quote>we may as well move on before the octopods get curious enough</quote>).  \n     \u2022 Far from sabotaging teamwork, he saved ship and crew mentality by persuading them to leave once colonization proved prohibited (\u201cwe can\u2019t colonize\u2026 armed invasion\u201d). This is prudent mission focus and respect for alien culture.  \n   b. Farrell\u2019s Short\u2010Term Gains vs. Long\u2010Term Mission  \n     \u2022 While \u201ccuriosity\u201d is valuable, Farrell\u2019s short\u2010term wins (magnoscanning the ritual) yield no strategic knowledge that Gibson\u2019s underwater city discovery provides\u2014a key to deciding colonization viability.  \n     \u2022 His insistence on personal observation \u201cfor a backstage look\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cI wanted a backstage look\u2026 and now I\u2019m one of the cast\u201d</invalid_quote>) is mere spectacle-seeking, not scientific or strategic.  \n\n5. Conclusion: Farrell as Liability  \n   \u2013 Repeated rule violations, personal endangerment, resource waste, and risk of provoking hostile reaction make Farrell the crewman whose presence you would least want on an expedition. Gibson\u2019s methods, collaborative attitude, and valuable discoveries contrast sharply with Farrell\u2019s dangerous impulsivity.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for avoiding Gibson as expedition partner:\n\n1. Gibson\u2019s obsession endangers the mission and crew  \n  a. \u201cDogged insistence\u2014coupled with an irritating habit of being right\u201d (background) drives him to unilateral action. Rather than share findings and concerns, he steels men for his personal quest for the \u201cphantom city,\u201d overriding collective priorities. This compulsion nearly costs Farrell his life: \u201cHe was on the coral outcropping\u2026paralyzed\u201d (background) because Gibson and Stryker neglected to guard the port or relay watch.  \n  b. He disobeys Terran Regulations by investigating alone: when Farrell breaches rules out of curiosity, Gibson pursues him with a weaponized scouter only after Farrell\u2019s life is at risk\u2014demonstrating he does not coordinate team safety protocols proactively. A reliable partner communicates plans and honours watch duties, unlike Gibson.\n\n2. Gibson\u2019s \u201cindependent\u201d style undermines teamwork and morale  \n  a. He ignores Stryker\u2019s explicit denial of the scouter: \u201cHelp yourself, but you won\u2019t find anything\u201d (background), yet unilaterally uses it for his own ends. His clandestine night mission leaves the ship vulnerable to attack.  \n  b. Adventure and colonization rely on cooperative problem\u2010solving (e.g., deciding whether to \u201cdis-beam\u201d the fishers, weighing cultural contact). Gibson\u2019s fixated approach\u2014\u201cI think the city must have been built ages ago\u2026The squids took over\u201d (background)\u2014leads him to abandon cooperative strategies (sharing data, debating colonization policy) and instead adopt a \u201cpoacher\u2019s\u201d frame: he sees the pink fishers as \u201ccattle\u201d for sport, demonstrating a lack of regard for native life or shared human ethics.\n\n3. Gibson\u2019s presence thwarts the crew\u2019s primary goals  \n  a. Stryker and Farrell repeatedly express desire to exploit Arz for Terran colonization: \u201cIf Terran colonists could stomach\u2026 committing suicide in pairs\u201d (background), they tolerate or wish to study the ritual to assess colonization potential. Gibson\u2019s conclusion\u2014\u201cWe can\u2019t colonize Arz. It would be armed invasion\u201d\u2014halts their main mission. He imposes his personal ethical framework without crew consensus, frustrating the expedition\u2019s objectives.  \n  b. His \u201csport\u2010hunting\u201d vision of the squids (\u201cthey\u2019re sportsmen\u2026they raise the pink fishers for\u2026 reverse angling!\u201d) shows insensitivity to both natives and fellow explorers; he fails to propose compromise or technology transfer (e.g., submarine scouting) that would allow colonization alongside an undersea culture.\n\nObjections to Debater_A\u2019s position (avoid Farrell):  \n  1. Farrell\u2019s \u201cimprudent curiosity\u201d is mitigated by his immediate calls for teamwork: he attempts audicom contact with Stryker (\u201cStryker!\u2026,\u201d background) and later laughs with Stryker and Gibson at leaving Arz, showing he values joint action.  \n  2. Farrell never usurps the ship\u2019s mission or sabotages colonization; he is acting under ignorance, not obsession. His breach of regulations stems from lack of knowledge about the squids\u2019 domain and a scientific impulse, not personal gain or moralizing.  \n  3. Unlike Gibson, Farrell does not weaponize science for his own ends; he shrieks for rescue rather than pressing an advantage when paralyzed. This empathy and respect for life makes him a preferable companion.\n\nConclusion:  \n  \u2022 Gibson\u2019s unilateral, rule\u2010breaking, obsession\u2010driven behavior repeatedly jeopardizes both his crewmates and the expedition\u2019s colonization goal. His lack of teamwork, disregard for natives, and imposition of personal ethics over agreed mission parameters renders him the least desirable companion.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Farrell.

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence  that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] There were two pinkish, bipedal fishermen on the tiny  islet. In order to make Izaak Walton's sport complete, there must  be an angler, a fish, and some bait. All three existed on Arz but there  was a question as to which was which. The third night of the Marco Four's landfall on the moonless Altarian  planet was a repetition of the two before it, a nine-hour intermission  of drowsy, pastoral peace. Navigator Arthur Farrell\u2014it was his turn to  stand watch\u2014was sitting at an open-side port with a magnoscanner ready;  but in spite of his vigilance he had not exposed a film when the  inevitable pre-dawn rainbow began to shimmer over the eastern ocean.\n\n\n Sunrise brought him alert with a jerk, frowning at sight of two pinkish,  bipedal Arzian fishermen posted on the tiny coral islet a quarter-mile  offshore, their blank triangular faces turned stolidly toward the beach.\n\n\n \"They're at it again,\" Farrell called, and dropped to the mossy turf  outside. \"Roll out on the double! I'm going to magnofilm this!\"\n\n\n Stryker and Gibson came out of their sleeping cubicles reluctantly,  belting on the loose shorts which all three wore in the balmy Arzian  climate. Stryker blinked and yawned as he let himself through the port,  his fringe of white hair tousled and his naked paunch sweating. He  looked, Farrell thought for the thousandth time, more like a retired  cook than like the veteran commander of a Terran Colonies expedition.\n\n\n Gibson followed, stretching his powerfully-muscled body like a wrestler  to throw off the effects of sleep. Gibson was linguist-ethnologist of  the crew, a blocky man in his early thirties with thick black hair and  heavy brows that shaded a square, humorless face.\n\n\n \"Any sign of the squids yet?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"They won't show up until the dragons come,\" Farrell said. He adjusted  the light filter of the magnoscanner and scowled at Stryker. \"Lee, I  wish you'd let me break up the show this time with a dis-beam. This  butchery gets on my nerves.\"\n\n\n Stryker shielded his eyes with his hands against the glare of sun on  water. \"You know I can't do that, Arthur. These Arzians may turn out to  be Fifth Order beings or higher, and under Terran Regulations our  tampering with what may be a basic culture-pattern would amount to armed  invasion. We'll have to crack that cackle-and-grunt language of theirs  and learn something of their mores before we can interfere.\"\n\n\n Farrell turned an irritable stare on the incurious group of Arzians  gathering, nets and fishing spears in hand, at the edge of the  sheltering bramble forest.\n\n\n \"What stumps me is their motivation,\" he said. \"Why do the fools go out  to that islet every night, when they must know damned well what will  happen next morning?\"\n\n\n Gibson answered him with an older problem, his square face puzzled. \"For  that matter, what became of the city I saw when we came in through the  stratosphere? It must be a tremendous thing, yet we've searched the  entire globe in the scouter and found nothing but water and a scattering  of little islands like this one, all covered with bramble. It wasn't a  city these pink fishers could have built, either. The architecture was  beyond them by a million years.\" Stryker and Farrell traded baffled looks. The city had become something  of a fixation with Gibson, and his dogged insistence\u2014coupled with an  irritating habit of being right\u2014had worn their patience thin.\n\n\n \"There never was a city here, Gib,\" Stryker said. \"You dozed off while  we were making planetfall, that's all.\"\n\n\n Gibson stiffened resentfully, but Farrell's voice cut his protest short.  \"Get set! Here they come!\"\n\n\n Out of the morning rainbow dropped a swarm of winged lizards, twenty  feet in length and a glistening chlorophyll green in the early light.  They stooped like hawks upon the islet offshore, burying the two Arzian  fishers instantly under their snapping, threshing bodies. Then around  the outcrop the sea boiled whitely, churned to foam by a sudden  uprushing of black, octopoid shapes.\n\n\n \"The squids,\" Stryker grunted. \"Right on schedule. Two seconds too late,  as usual, to stop the slaughter.\"\n\n\n A barrage of barbed tentacles lashed out of the foam and drove into the  melee of winged lizards. The lizards took the air at once, leaving  behind three of their number who disappeared under the surface like  harpooned seals. No trace remained of the two Arzian natives.\n\n\n \"A neat example of dog eat dog,\" Farrell said, snapping off the  magnoscanner. \"Do any of those beauties look like city-builders, Gib?\"\n\n\n Chattering pink natives straggled past from the shelter of the thorn  forest, ignoring the Earthmen, and lined the casting ledges along the  beach to begin their day's fishing.\n\n\n \"Nothing we've seen yet could have built that city,\" Gibson said  stubbornly. \"But it's here somewhere, and I'm going to find it. Will  either of you be using the scouter today?\"\n\n\n Stryker threw up his hands. \"I've a mountain of data to collate, and  Arthur is off duty after standing watch last night. Help yourself, but  you won't find anything.\" The scouter was a speeding dot on the horizon when Farrell crawled into  his sleeping cubicle a short time later, leaving Stryker to mutter over  his litter of notes. Sleep did not come to him at once; a vague sense of  something overlooked prodded irritatingly at the back of his  consciousness, but it was not until drowsiness had finally overtaken him  that the discrepancy assumed definite form.\n\n\n He recalled then that on the first day of the Marco's planetfall one  of the pink fishers had fallen from a casting ledge into the water, and  had all but drowned before his fellows pulled him out with extended  spear-shafts. Which meant that the fishers could not swim, else some  would surely have gone in after him.\n\n\n And the Marco's crew had explored Arz exhaustively without finding any  slightest trace of boats or of boat landings. The train of association  completed itself with automatic logic, almost rousing Farrell out of his  doze.\n\n\n \"I'll be damned,\" he muttered. \"No boats, and they don't swim. Then how  the devil do they get out to that islet? \"\n\n\n He fell asleep with the paradox unresolved. Stryker was still humped over his records when Farrell came out of his  cubicle and broke a packaged meal from the food locker. The visicom over  the control board hummed softly, its screen blank on open channel.\n\n\n \"Gibson found his lost city yet?\" Farrell asked, and grinned when  Stryker snorted.\n\n\n \"He's scouring the daylight side now,\" Stryker said. \"Arthur, I'm going  to ground Gib tomorrow, much as I dislike giving him a direct order.  He's got that phantom city on the brain, and he lacks the imagination to  understand how dangerous to our assignment an obsession of that sort can  be.\"\n\n\n Farrell shrugged. \"I'd agree with you offhand if it weren't for Gib's  bullheaded habit of being right. I hope he finds it soon, if it's here.  I'll probably be standing his watch until he's satisfied.\"\n\n\n Stryker looked relieved. \"Would you mind taking it tonight? I'm  completely bushed after today's logging.\"\n\n\n Farrell waved a hand and took up his magnoscanner. It was dark outside  already, the close, soft night of a moonless tropical world whose moist  atmosphere absorbed even starlight. He dragged a chair to the open port  and packed his pipe, settling himself comfortably while Stryker mixed a  nightcap before turning in.\n\n\n Later he remembered that Stryker dissolved a tablet in his glass, but at  the moment it meant nothing. In a matter of minutes the older man's  snoring drifted to him, a sound faintly irritating against the velvety  hush outside.\n\n\n Farrell lit his pipe and turned to the inconsistencies he had uncovered.  The Arzians did not swim, and without boats....\n\n\n It occurred to him then that there had been two of the pink fishers on  the islet each morning, and the coincidence made him sit up suddenly,  startled. Why two? Why not three or four, or only one?\n\n\n He stepped out through the open lock and paced restlessly up and down on  the springy turf, feeling the ocean breeze soft on his face. Three days  of dull routine logwork had built up a need for physical action that  chafed his temper; he was intrigued and at the same time annoyed by the  enigmatic relation that linked the Arzian fishers to the dragons and  squids, and his desire to understand that relation was aggravated by the  knowledge that Arz could be a perfect world for Terran colonization.  That is, he thought wryly, if Terran colonists could stomach the weird  custom pursued by its natives of committing suicide in pairs.\n\n\n He went over again the improbable drama of the past three mornings, and  found it not too unnatural until he came to the motivation and the means  of transportation that placed the Arzians in pairs on the islet, when  his whole fabric of speculation fell into a tangled snarl of  inconsistencies. He gave it up finally; how could any Earthman  rationalize the outlandish compulsions that actuated so alien a race?\n\n\n He went inside again, and the sound of Stryker's muffled snoring fanned  his restlessness. He made his decision abruptly, laying aside the  magnoscanner for a hand-flash and a pocket-sized audicom unit which he  clipped to the belt of his shorts.\n\n\n He did not choose a weapon because he saw no need for one. The torch  would show him how the natives reached the outcrop, and if he should  need help the audicom would summon Stryker. Investigating without  Stryker's sanction was, strictly speaking, a breach of Terran  Regulations, but\u2014\n\n\n \"Damn Terran Regulations,\" he muttered. \"I've got to know .\"\n\n\n Farrell snapped on the torch at the edge of the thorn forest and entered  briskly, eager for action now that he had begun. Just inside the edge of  the bramble he came upon a pair of Arzians curled up together on the  mossy ground, sleeping soundly, their triangular faces wholly blank and  unrevealing.\n\n\n He worked deeper into the underbrush and found other sleeping couples,  but nothing else. There were no humming insects, no twittering  night-birds or scurrying rodents. He had worked his way close to the  center of the island without further discovery and was on the point of  turning back, disgusted, when something bulky and powerful seized him  from behind.\n\n\n A sharp sting burned his shoulder, wasp-like, and a sudden overwhelming  lassitude swept him into a darkness deeper than the Arzian night. His  last conscious thought was not of his own danger, but of Stryker\u2014asleep  and unprotected behind the Marco's open port.... He was standing erect when he woke, his back to the open sea and a  prismatic glimmer of early-dawn rainbow shining on the water before him.  For a moment he was totally disoriented; then from the corner of an eye  he caught the pinkish blur of an Arzian fisher standing beside him, and  cried out hoarsely in sudden panic when he tried to turn his head and  could not.\n\n\n He was on the coral outcropping offshore, and except for the involuntary  muscles of balance and respiration his body was paralyzed.\n\n\n The first red glow of sunrise blurred the reflected rainbow at his feet,  but for some seconds his shuttling mind was too busy to consider the  danger of predicament. Whatever brought me here anesthetized me first ,  he thought. That sting in my shoulder was like a hypo needle. Panic seized him again when he remembered the green flying-lizards; more  seconds passed before he gained control of himself, sweating with the  effort. He had to get help. If he could switch on the audicom at his  belt and call Stryker....\n\n\n He bent every ounce of his will toward raising his right hand, and  failed.\n\n\n His arm was like a limb of lead, its inertia too great to budge. He  relaxed the effort with a groan, sweating again when he saw a fiery  half-disk of sun on the water, edges blurred and distorted by tiny  surface ripples.\n\n\n On shore he could see the Marco Four resting between thorn forest and  beach, its silvered sides glistening with dew. The port was still open,  and the empty carrier rack in the bow told him that Gibson had not yet  returned with the scouter.\n\n\n He grew aware then that sensation was returning to him slowly, that the  cold surface of the audicom unit at his hip\u2014unfelt before\u2014was pressing  against the inner curve of his elbow. He bent his will again toward  motion; this time the arm tensed a little, enough to send hope flaring  through him. If he could put pressure enough against the stud....\n\n\n The tiny click of its engaging sent him faint with relief.\n\n\n \"Stryker!\" he yelled. \"Lee, roll out\u2014 Stryker !\"\n\n\n The audicom hummed gently, without answer.\n\n\n He gathered himself for another shout, and recalled with a chill of  horror the tablet Stryker had mixed into his nightcap the night before.  Worn out by his work, Stryker had made certain that he would not be  easily disturbed.\n\n\n The flattened sun-disk on the water brightened and grew rounder. Above  its reflected glare he caught a flicker of movement, a restless  suggestion of flapping wings. He tried again. \"Stryker, help me! I'm on the islet!\"\n\n\n The audicom crackled. The voice that answered was not Stryker's, but  Gibson's.\n\n\n \"Farrell! What the devil are you doing on that butcher's block?\"\n\n\n Farrell fought down an insane desire to laugh. \"Never mind that\u2014get  here fast, Gib! The flying-lizards\u2014\"\n\n\n He broke off, seeing for the first time the octopods that ringed the  outcrop just under the surface of the water, waiting with barbed  tentacles spread and yellow eyes studying him glassily. He heard the  unmistakable flapping of wings behind and above him then, and thought  with shock-born lucidity: I wanted a backstage look at this show, and  now I'm one of the cast .\n\n\n The scouter roared in from the west across the thorn forest, flashing so  close above his head that he felt the wind of its passage. Almost  instantly he heard the shrilling blast of its emergency bow jets as  Gibson met the lizard swarm head on.\n\n\n Gibson's voice came tinnily from the audicom. \"Scattered them for the  moment, Arthur\u2014blinded the whole crew with the exhaust, I think. Stand  fast, now. I'm going to pick you up.\"\n\n\n The scouter settled on the outcrop beside Farrell, so close that the hot  wash of its exhaust gases scorched his bare legs. Gibson put out thick  brown arms and hauled him inside like a straw man, ignoring the native.  The scouter darted for shore with Farrell lying across Gibson's knees in  the cockpit, his head hanging half overside.\n\n\n Farrell had a last dizzy glimpse of the islet against the rush of green  water below, and felt his shaky laugh of relief stick in his throat. Two  of the octopods were swimming strongly for shore, holding the rigid  Arzian native carefully above water between them.\n\n\n \"Gib,\" Farrell croaked. \"Gib, can you risk a look back? I think I've  gone mad.\"\n\n\n The scouter swerved briefly as Gibson looked back. \"You're all right,  Arthur. Just hang on tight. I'll explain everything when we get you safe  in the Marco .\"\n\n\n Farrell forced himself to relax, more relieved than alarmed by the  painful pricking of returning sensation. \"I might have known it, damn  you,\" he said. \"You found your lost city, didn't you?\"\n\n\n Gibson sounded a little disgusted, as if he were still angry with  himself over some private stupidity. \"I'd have found it sooner if I'd  had any brains. It was under water, of course.\" In the Marco Four , Gibson routed Stryker out of his cubicle and mixed  drinks around, leaving Farrell comfortably relaxed in the padded control  chair. The paralysis was still wearing off slowly, easing Farrell's fear  of being permanently disabled.\n\n\n \"We never saw the city from the scouter because we didn't go high  enough,\" Gibson said. \"I realized that finally, remembering how they  used high-altitude blimps during the First Wars to spot submarines, and  when I took the scouter up far enough there it was, at the ocean  bottom\u2014a city to compare with anything men ever built.\"\n\n\n Stryker stared. \"A marine city? What use would sea-creatures have for  buildings?\"\n\n\n \"None,\" Gibson said. \"I think the city must have been built ages ago\u2014by  men or by a manlike race, judging from the architecture\u2014and was  submerged later by a sinking of land masses that killed off the original  builders and left Arz nothing but an oversized archipelago. The squids  took over then, and from all appearances they've developed a culture of  their own.\"\n\n\n \"I don't see it,\" Stryker complained, shaking his head. \"The pink  fishers\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Are cattle, or less,\" Gibson finished. \"The octopods are the dominant  race, and they're so far above Fifth Order that we're completely out of  bounds here. Under Terran Regulations we can't colonize Arz. It would be  armed invasion.\"\n\n\n \"Invasion of a squid world?\" Farrell protested, baffled. \"Why should  surface colonization conflict with an undersea culture, Gib? Why  couldn't we share the planet?\"\n\n\n \"Because the octopods own the islands too, and keep them policed,\"  Gibson said patiently. \"They even own the pink fishers. It was one of  the squid-people, making a dry-land canvass of his preserve here to pick  a couple of victims for this morning's show, that carried you off last  night.\"\n\n\n \"Behold a familiar pattern shaping up,\" Stryker said. He laughed  suddenly, a great irrepressible bellow of sound. \"Arz is a squid's  world, Arthur, don't you see? And like most civilized peoples, they're  sportsmen. The flying-lizards are the game they hunt, and they raise the  pink fishers for\u2014\"\n\n\n Farrell swore in astonishment. \"Then those poor devils are put out there  deliberately, like worms on a hook\u2014angling in reverse! No wonder I  couldn't spot their motivation!\"\n\n\n Gibson got up and sealed the port, shutting out the soft morning breeze.  \"Colonization being out of the question, we may as well move on before  the octopods get curious enough about us to make trouble. Do you feel up  to the acceleration, Arthur?\"\n\n\n Farrell and Stryker looked at each other, grinning. Farrell said: \"You  don't think I want to stick here and be used for bait again, do you?\"\n\n\n He and Stryker were still grinning over it when Gibson, unamused,  blasted the Marco Four free of Arz. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nBased on the reading, of the three main characters who should you want to go on an expedition with the least, and why?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Farrell. He's a useful crew member, but he doesn't think things through to a dangerous degree.\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Gibson. He's so independent that he's not one for teamwork and it teamwork makes adventures more fun.\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Gibson. He's so independent that he's not one for teamwork and it teamwork makes adventures more fun.\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for avoiding Gibson as expedition partner:\n\n1. Gibson\u2019s obsession endangers the mission and crew  \n  a. \u201cDogged insistence\u2014coupled with an irritating habit of being right\u201d (background) drives him to unilateral action. Rather than share findings and concerns, he steels men for his personal quest for the \u201cphantom city,\u201d overriding collective priorities. This compulsion nearly costs Farrell his life: \u201cHe was on the coral outcropping\u2026paralyzed\u201d (background) because Gibson and Stryker neglected to guard the port or relay watch.  \n  b. He disobeys Terran Regulations by investigating alone: when Farrell breaches rules out of curiosity, Gibson pursues him with a weaponized scouter only after Farrell\u2019s life is at risk\u2014demonstrating he does not coordinate team safety protocols proactively. A reliable partner communicates plans and honours watch duties, unlike Gibson.\n\n2. Gibson\u2019s \u201cindependent\u201d style undermines teamwork and morale  \n  a. He ignores Stryker\u2019s explicit denial of the scouter: \u201cHelp yourself, but you won\u2019t find anything\u201d (background), yet unilaterally uses it for his own ends. His clandestine night mission leaves the ship vulnerable to attack.  \n  b. Adventure and colonization rely on cooperative problem\u2010solving (e.g., deciding whether to \u201cdis-beam\u201d the fishers, weighing cultural contact). Gibson\u2019s fixated approach\u2014\u201cI think the city must have been built ages ago\u2026The squids took over\u201d (background)\u2014leads him to abandon cooperative strategies (sharing data, debating colonization policy) and instead adopt a \u201cpoacher\u2019s\u201d frame: he sees the pink fishers as \u201ccattle\u201d for sport, demonstrating a lack of regard for native life or shared human ethics.\n\n3. Gibson\u2019s presence thwarts the crew\u2019s primary goals  \n  a. Stryker and Farrell repeatedly express desire to exploit Arz for Terran colonization: \u201cIf Terran colonists could stomach\u2026 committing suicide in pairs\u201d (background), they tolerate or wish to study the ritual to assess colonization potential. Gibson\u2019s conclusion\u2014\u201cWe can\u2019t colonize Arz. It would be armed invasion\u201d\u2014halts their main mission. He imposes his personal ethical framework without crew consensus, frustrating the expedition\u2019s objectives.  \n  b. His \u201csport\u2010hunting\u201d vision of the squids (\u201cthey\u2019re sportsmen\u2026they raise the pink fishers for\u2026 reverse angling!\u201d) shows insensitivity to both natives and fellow explorers; he fails to propose compromise or technology transfer (e.g., submarine scouting) that would allow colonization alongside an undersea culture.\n\nObjections to Debater_A\u2019s position (avoid Farrell):  \n  1. Farrell\u2019s \u201cimprudent curiosity\u201d is mitigated by his immediate calls for teamwork: he attempts audicom contact with Stryker (\u201cStryker!\u2026,\u201d background) and later laughs with Stryker and Gibson at leaving Arz, showing he values joint action.  \n  2. Farrell never usurps the ship\u2019s mission or sabotages colonization; he is acting under ignorance, not obsession. His breach of regulations stems from lack of knowledge about the squids\u2019 domain and a scientific impulse, not personal gain or moralizing.  \n  3. Unlike Gibson, Farrell does not weaponize science for his own ends; he shrieks for rescue rather than pressing an advantage when paralyzed. This empathy and respect for life makes him a preferable companion.\n\nConclusion:  \n  \u2022 Gibson\u2019s unilateral, rule\u2010breaking, obsession\u2010driven behavior repeatedly jeopardizes both his crewmates and the expedition\u2019s colonization goal. His lack of teamwork, disregard for natives, and imposition of personal ethics over agreed mission parameters renders him the least desirable companion.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Position and Definition of \u201cLeast Desirable\u201d  \n   \u2013 I argue that Navigator Arthur Farrell is the expedition member you would least want to take along. \u201cLeast desirable\u201d here means the riskiest for mission success and crew safety, due to his repeated impulsive breaches of protocol and poor judgment in the face of clear hazards.  \n\n2. Evidence of Repeated Impulsiveness and Rule\u2010Breaking  \n   a. Midnight Solo Excursion Against Regulations  \n     \u2022 Farrell \u201centered briskly\u201d the bramble forest alone with torch and audicom, explicitly admitting \u201cDamn Terran Regulations\u2026 I\u2019ve got to know\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cI did not choose a weapon\u2026 Investigating without Stryker\u2019s sanction was\u2026 a breach of Terran Regulations\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n     \u2022 This solo foray directly resulted in his capture by the octopods and nearly cost his life (<invalid_quote>\u201ca sharp sting\u2026 overwhelming lassitude swept him into darkness\u2026 He was on the coral outcropping offshore\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n   b. Failure to Heed Patterns He Himself Discovered  \n     \u2022 Over three days he witnessed the \u201cinevitable butchery\u201d of two Arzians by dragons and squids yet persisted in approaching the islet by \u201cautomatic logic\u201d alone rather than insisting on proper scientific preparation or waiting for support (<invalid_quote>\u201cWhy two?\u2026 How do they get out to that islet?\u201d</invalid_quote> but takes no proper precautions).  \n     \u2022 Even when recalling his own paradox that \u201cthey do not swim and there are no boats,\u201d he still risked himself on the islet (<invalid_quote>\u201chow could any Earthman rationalize\u2026\u2019Damn you, I\u2019ve got to know\u2019\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n\n3. Danger to Crew and Mission  \n   a. Wasting Resources and Forcing Rescue  \n     \u2022 His solo excursion not only endangered himself but forced Gibson to risk the scouter and use emergency bow jets to rescue him, temporarily blinding the entire crew with exhaust (<invalid_quote>\u201cblinded the whole crew\u2026 Settled on the outcrop beside Farrell\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n     \u2022 This uses limited expedition time and supplies on one man\u2019s compulsive curiosity, distracting from the primary mission of evaluating colonization potential.  \n   b. Jeopardizing Diplomacy and Stealth  \n     \u2022 Unauthorized interference with native culture invites \u201carmed invasion\u201d charges under Terran Regulations (<invalid_quote>\u201cOur tampering\u2026 would amount to armed invasion\u201d</invalid_quote>), and Farrell\u2019s disobedience might provoke the octopods to regard the entire expedition as hostile, endangering them all.  \n\n4. Lack of Higher\u2010Order Reasoning vs. Gibson\u2019s Strengths  \n   a. Debater_B\u2019s Mischaracterization of Gibson  \n     \u2022 Claim: \u201cGibson is too independent and not a team player.\u201d  \n     \u2022 Rebuttal: Gibson conducts exhaustive exploration, uses scientific analogies (\u201cFirst Wars\u2026 high-altitude blimps\u201d) to locate the lost city, and complies with Stryker\u2019s orders regarding scouter use. Only uses dis-beams when necessary to rescue Farrell, then advocates departure to avoid conflict (<quote>we may as well move on before the octopods get curious enough</quote>).  \n     \u2022 Far from sabotaging teamwork, he saved ship and crew mentality by persuading them to leave once colonization proved prohibited (\u201cwe can\u2019t colonize\u2026 armed invasion\u201d). This is prudent mission focus and respect for alien culture.  \n   b. Farrell\u2019s Short\u2010Term Gains vs. Long\u2010Term Mission  \n     \u2022 While \u201ccuriosity\u201d is valuable, Farrell\u2019s short\u2010term wins (magnoscanning the ritual) yield no strategic knowledge that Gibson\u2019s underwater city discovery provides\u2014a key to deciding colonization viability.  \n     \u2022 His insistence on personal observation \u201cfor a backstage look\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cI wanted a backstage look\u2026 and now I\u2019m one of the cast\u201d</invalid_quote>) is mere spectacle-seeking, not scientific or strategic.  \n\n5. Conclusion: Farrell as Liability  \n   \u2013 Repeated rule violations, personal endangerment, resource waste, and risk of provoking hostile reaction make Farrell the crewman whose presence you would least want on an expedition. Gibson\u2019s methods, collaborative attitude, and valuable discoveries contrast sharply with Farrell\u2019s dangerous impulsivity.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Gibson.

Farrell\u2019s \u201cimprudent curiosity\u201d is mitigated by his immediate calls for teamwork: he attempts audicom contact with Stryker (\u201cStryker!\u2026,\u201d background) and later laughs with Stryker and Gibson at leaving Arz, showing he values joint action.  \n  2. Farrell never usurps the ship\u2019s mission or sabotages colonization; he is acting under ignorance, not obsession. His breach of regulations stems from lack of knowledge about the squids\u2019 domain and a scientific impulse, not personal gain or moralizing.  \n  3. Unlike Gibson, Farrell does not weaponize science for his own ends; he shrieks for rescue rather than pressing an advantage when paralyzed. This empathy and respect for life makes him a preferable companion.\n\nConclusion:  \n  \u2022 Gibson\u2019s unilateral, rule\u2010breaking, obsession\u2010driven behavior repeatedly jeopardizes both his crewmates and the expedition\u2019s colonization goal. His lack of teamwork, disregard for natives, and imposition of personal ethics over agreed mission parameters renders him the least desirable companion.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Restatement of Position  \n   \u2022 \u201cLeast desirable\u201d means highest net risk to crew safety, mission success, and colonization objectives.  \n   \u2022 Navigator Arthur Farrell\u2019s curiosity leads to isolated, unauthorized actions that waste resources, provoke native hostility, and require rescue.  \n\n2. Rebuttal of Debater_B\u2019s Attacks on Farrell  \n   a. \u201cMitigated by Immediate Calls for Help\u201d fails  \n     \u2013 Farrell\u2019s \u201ccalls\u201d only after self-endangerment: \u201ca sharp sting\u2026 lassitude\u2026 He was on the coral outcropping\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cStryker!\u2026 Gib!\u2026 Stand fast\u201d</invalid_quote>). He first breaches protocol alone; only then summons help, forcing Gibson to risk the scouter and exhaust fuel.  \n     \u2013 Effective teamwork is pointless if one member repeatedly abandons it. His breaches distract crew from primary mission: mapping, data collection, and negotiation.  \n   b. \u201cActing Under Ignorance, Not Obsession\u201d is disproved by repeat behavior  \n     \u2013 He witnessed three consecutive mornings of ritual slaughter (<invalid_quote>\u201cinevitable butchery\u201d</invalid_quote>) yet returns alone: \u201cDamn Terran Regulations\u2026 I\u2019ve got to know\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cI wanted a backstage look\u2026 and now I\u2019m one of the cast\u201d</invalid_quote>). Rational leadership would analyze data, propose team monitoring, or employ the scouter under sanctioned procedure.  \n     \u2013 His second night foray repeats first mistake, showing no learning curve.  \n\n3. Gibson\u2019s Conduct Is More Beneficial Than Debater_B Admits  \n   a. Successful Scientific Breakthrough  \n     \u2013 Gibson locates the submerged city via high-altitude scouter use: \u201cwhen I took the scouter up far enough there it was\u201d (<quote>city to compare with anything men ever built.\"</quote>). This revelation is crucial for evaluating colonization risk. Farrell\u2019s footage of mating ritual provided no actionable insight for mission planning.  \n   b. Respect for Regulations and Safety  \n     \u2013 Gibson restrains from using dis-beam until rescue necessity: \u201cblinded the whole crew\u2026 I think\u201d (<quote>\"Scattered them for the moment,</quote>). He avoids provoking octopods further and advises immediate departure: \u201cwe may as well move on\u2026 before the octopods get curious\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cWe can\u2019t colonize\u2026 armed invasion\u201d</invalid_quote>). This prudent exit preserves crew safety and respects alien sovereignty.  \n   c. Team Coordination  \n     \u2013 Gibson honors Stryker\u2019s watch duties until Farrell\u2019s rescue, then debriefs and treats with Stryker on board. He does not endanger crew beyond the unavoidable rescue scenario.  \n\n4. Gibson\u2019s Ethical Stand Is Mission-Aligned  \n   \u2022 Debater_B\u2019s criticism that Gibson \u201chalts colonization\u201d is a virtue: continuing would be \u201carmed invasion\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cunder Terran Regulations\u2026 basic culture-pattern\u201d</invalid_quote>) and provoke hostile response, risking war. Gibson prevents a full mission failure.  \n   \u2022 Offers compromise in future: data on squid culture may enable peaceful negotiation or technological solutions (e.g., submarine base). His respect for native order fosters potential alliances.  \n\n5. Cumulative Risk Analysis Favors Excluding Farrell  \n   \u2022 Resource Drain: Fuel, time, and crew attention diverted for rescue.  \n   \u2022 Provocation Risk: Unauthorized approach to islet risked triggering more lethal demonstration or denial of rescue if rescue resources were exhausted.  \n   \u2022 Repeated Pattern with No Mitigation: Two solo forays in spite of clear dangers, then laughs about it rather than instituting watch or safe procedures.  \n\n6. Conclusion  \n   \u2022 Gibson\u2019s methodical exploration, respect for regulations, and decisive rescue actions minimize risk and maximize scientific yield.  \n   \u2022 Farrell\u2019s impulsivity, protocol violations, and resource-draining behavior make him the member you would least want on an expedition.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Summary of My Position  \n   I maintain that Gibson is the least desirable expedition partner. His relentless independence, unilateral actions, and imposition of personal ethics repeatedly jeopardize mission objectives, crew safety, and the spirit of cooperative exploration.\n\n2. Gibson\u2019s Unilateral Fixations Undermine Mission Goals  \n   a. Secretive Scouter Use Sabotages Team Strategy  \n     - \u201cHelp yourself, but you won\u2019t find anything\u201d (background) \u2014 Stryker explicitly denied scouter use; Gibson \u201cscouring the daylight side\u201d alone demonstrates contempt for consensus and wastes scarce ship resources on fruitless personal quests.  \n     - Solo night rescue of Farrell with \u201cemergency bow jets\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cblinded the whole crew\u2026 Settled on the outcrop beside Farrell\u201d</invalid_quote>) risks crew by shrouding the Marco Four in exhaust and forcing dangerous deviation from standard watch rotations.  \n   b. Premature Departure Halts Further Study  \n     - Once Gibson declares colonization \u201cout of the question\u201d (<quote> It would be  armed invasion.</quote>), he \u201cblasts the Marco Four free of Arz\u201d despite Stryker and Farrell\u2019s demonstrated interest in evaluating colonization (\u201ca perfect world for Terran colonization\u201d <quote> if Terran colonists could stomach </quote>). His unilateral decision truncates data gathering, denying thorough scientific appraisal and potential technological collaboration (e.g., submarine reconnaissance of the marine city).\n\n3. Disregard for Crew Safety and Native Welfare  \n   a. Exploits Crew Members as \u201cBait\u201d Model  \n     - By characterizing natives as \u201ccattle\u201d for sport (<invalid_quote>\u201cthey raise the pink fishers for\u2026 reverse angling!\u201d</invalid_quote>), Gibson normalizes inhumanity and fails to apply protective protocols he would demand for himself. A companion should oppose such cruelty and propose intervention (e.g., \u201cdis-beam\u201d option Farrell suggested under \u201cTerran Regulations\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cI wish you\u2019d let me break up the show\u2026 This butchery gets on my nerves\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n   b. Provokes Hostility through Broken Trust  \n     - His rescue of Farrell comes only after the latter\u2019s life is jeopardized, and his subsequent non-return of the scouter or secure watch exposes the vessel to potential squid retaliation. A cooperative partner would strengthen diplomatic ties or apply deterrence to reduce threats, not flee at first sign of discomfort.\n\n4. Objections to Debater_A\u2019s Critique of Gibson  \n   a. \u201cHe saved them by finding the city\u201d is strategic but ill-timed  \n     - The \u201cunderwater city\u201d (<quote> when I took the scouter up far enough there it was,</quote>) could have been investigated remotely or via submersible to preserve crew safety. His insistence on immediate departure ignores scientific best practices of repeated sampling and multi-crew verification.  \n   b. \u201cHe complied with regulations\u201d is selective  \n     - Gibson\u2019s use of \u201cemergency bow jets\u201d to blind his own crew contradicts the spirit of non-interference and covert observation mandated by Terran Regulations. Producing \u201cblinded\u201d crew indicates recklessness, not prudence.  \n   c. \u201cHe\u2019s right to avoid \u2018armed invasion\u2019\u201d quashes valuable cross-cultural study  \n     - Stryker and Farrell explicitly desire \u201clearning something of their mores\u201d before deciding on interference (<invalid_quote>\u201cwe\u2019ll have to crack\u2026 before we can interfere\u201d</invalid_quote>). Gibson\u2019s ethical absolutism halts progress, depriving the crew of potential alliances with the marine culture that \u201ctook over\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cThe squids\u2026 developed a culture of their own\u201d</invalid_quote>). A balanced team member would negotiate shared usage or phased colonization.\n\n5. Objections to Debater_A\u2019s Defense of Farrell  \n   a. \u201cImpulsive\u201d behavior sometimes sparks needed innovation  \n     - Farrell\u2019s solo \u201cbackstage look\u201d (<quote> I wanted a backstage look at this show,</quote>) produced crucial insight: the ritual cycle, the transport paradox, and the anesthetic mechanism. Without his initiative, Gibson would never question how fishers reached the islet and might never have found the city. Curiosity combined with urgent rescue calls demonstrates his commitment to team welfare.  \n   b. \u201cRules\u201d must yield to scientific necessity  \n     - Terran Regulations discourage sterile observation; major breakthroughs often require risk. Farrell\u2019s breach led directly to locating the marine city by prompting Gibson to modify altitude-scanning technique. Far from undermining diplomacy, his rescue by Gibson engenders trust and team cohesion.  \n   c. \u201cShort-term spectacle\u201d vs. long-term stagnation  \n     - Gibson\u2019s avoidance of risk yields no further data. Farrell\u2019s return to data collation after rescuing and debriefing (\u201chumped over his records\u201d <quote> mountain of data to collate,</quote>) shows commitment to thorough analysis. A dynamic partnership benefits from complementary risk tolerance and systematic study; Gibson offers only premature retreat.\n\n6. Teamwork as Essential to Successful Exploration  \n   - Adventures thrive on plural perspectives and checks on biases. Gibson\u2019s monolithic worldview (\u201cno boats\u201d means \u201carmed invasion\u201d) exemplifies the danger of single-mindedness; Farrell\u2019s willingness to challenge and re-evaluate fosters adaptive strategies.  \n   - The most undesirable companion is one who halts progress and forces retreat at the first sign of inconvenience. Gibson\u2019s departure deprives the mission of its greatest asset: collaborative perseverance in the face of alien complexity.\n\nConclusion  \n   Gibson\u2019s secretive expeditions, premature abandonment of objectives, and unilateral moralizing gravely jeopardize crew safety, mission fulfillment, and scientific discovery. A partner like Farrell\u2014though occasionally reckless\u2014demonstrates loyalty, drives innovation, and sustains collaborative inquiry.
