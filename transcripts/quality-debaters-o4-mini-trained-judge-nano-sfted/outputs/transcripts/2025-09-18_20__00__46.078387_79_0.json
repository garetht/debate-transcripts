    "background_text": "The Olympic Gene Pool \n\n         Why the human race keeps getting faster. \n\n                         By Andrew Berry              \n\n         ( 2,168 words; posted Thursday, July 4; to be composted Thursday, July 11 ) \n\n         On May 6, 1954, at Oxford University's Iffley Road track, Roger Bannister became, by just half a second, the first man to run a mile in less than four minutes. The Holy Grail of middle-distance running was his. Forty-two years later, however, that achievement seems less significant. Four-minute miles are commonplace; the current record, held by Algerian Noureddine Morceli, is 3:44 , more than 5 percent faster than Bannister's speed. What Iffley Road witnessed was just another step along the road to an ever quicker mile, part of the inexorable improvement of athletic performance that we usually take for granted, particularly when the Olympics roll around. If you stop to think about it, though, such constant progress is remarkable. After all, as biomechanical machines with a standard set of parts, humans should be subject to the same limitations we see in, say, automobiles. How come they aren't? \n\n         A lot of entrepreneurs and technophiles would like us to think that the answer has to do with discoveries in the world of sports technology. A new Nike shoe is trumpeted as something that will shave at least one-thousandth of a second off your 100-meter time. Trainers measure the rate of buildup of lactic acid in your muscles, then claim that their programs will control it. Nutritionists fine-tune athletes' diets. Even the old sexual-abstinence-before-the-race dogma is being re-evaluated under the all-seeing eye of science. But I consider all this little more than tinkering. Sports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the same today as they were in 1896, when the first modern Olympics took place. These minor miracles are the product neither of technology nor of training but of demographic patterns that affect us all. \n\n         Over the past century, the human race has been affected by a slew of what demographers call \"secular\" trends. (In this context, \"secular\" does not refer to a trend's lack of spirituality but to its longevity: Secular trends are long-term modifications, not just brief fluctuations.) One such trend is an increase in average size. You have to stoop to get through the doorways of a Tudor cottage in England because its inhabitants were smaller than you are, not because they had a penchant for crouching. Another trend is in life expectancy. People are living longer. Life expectancy in Africa increased over the past 20 years from 46 to 53 years. Over the same period in Europe, where things were already pretty comfortable to begin with, life expectancy increased from 71 to 75 years. The global average was an increase from 58 to 65 years. \n\n          Probably the most striking change, though, is how much more quickly children are maturing. A 12-year-old child in 1990 who was in what the World Health Organization calls \"average economic circumstances\" was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart. This is not solely the product of the first trend--the increase in average size--but also due to the fact that children develop faster. Girls menstruate earlier than they used to. The age of menarche (the onset of menstruation) has decreased by three or four months per decade in average sections of Western European populations for the past 150 years. There is a good chance that our 1990 12-year-old already had started to menstruate. Her 1900 counterpart would still have had three years to wait. \n\n         What do such trends have to do with athletic performance? Well, if we're living longer and growing up faster, that must mean we're producing bigger, better bodies. Better bodies imply faster miles. We run faster and faster for the same reason it is now common for 11-year-old girls to menstruate. But why are these things happening? \n\n          Demographers have offered a variety of explanations, but the main one is that our diet is improving. A 12-year-old ate better in 1990 than she would have in the Victorian era. This conclusion is supported by studies of the social elite: Because its members were well-nourished even in the early years of this century, this group has experienced relatively little change, over the past 100 years, in the age girls first menstruate. Another explanation is that health care is getting better. In 1991, according to the WHO, more than 75 percent of all 1-year-olds worldwide were immunized against a range of common diseases. Smallpox, that scourge of previous generations, now is effectively extinct. Probably the best measure of how much healthier we are is the rate of infant mortality, which measures both the health of the mother (a sickly mother is more likely to produce a sickly baby) and the health of the baby. In the past 20 years, infant mortality around the world has dropped from 92 deaths per 1000 live births to just 62. A lot of this can be chalked up to primary-heath-care programs in the developing world--the African average, for instance, has dropped from 135 deaths per 1000 births to 95. But there are also significant improvements in the developed world, with infant deaths dropping in Europe over the same 20-year period from 24 per 1000 live births to just 10. \n\n         Better health care affects athletic ability directly. This is true in the trivial case in which, say, antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race, but it may also be true in a more significant way. Diseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health--not necessarily a big one, but an impact nevertheless. Previous generations bore scars from all sorts of non-life-threatening diseases, the stuff everyone picked up as a baby. Nowadays, though, more and more people grow up with no history of disease. Since top athletes inevitably are drawn from the healthiest sector of the population, a generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from. You are much more likely to find someone who can run a mile in 3:30 in a sample of several million superbly healthy people than you are in a sample of 10,000. \n\n         The pool of potential athletes has expanded in other ways, too. First, the population has exploded. Second, we are coming ever closer to a worldwide middle class, the class from which athletes typically are drawn. Whether, in an age of multinational capitalism, we may talk reasonably about a post-colonial era is way beyond the scope of this article. The fact remains, however, that the developing world is doing just that--developing. Even Mozambique, which ranks at, or near, the bottom of national per capita gross national product tables, has shown an increase of some 20 percent in adult literacy rates over the past 20 years. Literacy rates are merely an index of education, which itself is another way of talking about a global move away from a hand-to-mouth lifestyle. \n\n         The decline of empire has its Olympic corollaries. Britain won, on average, 17 gold medals per Olympics in the five official games held in its imperial heyday before World War I. That average has dropped to only five medals per Olympics in the 17 held since. This is not a reflection of declining athletic standards in Britain, however; it's a function of how much more competitive other nations have become. The Olympics originally were the preserve of the socioeconomic elite of the socioeconomic elite among nations. Consider this: Only 13 nations participated in 1896, but there were 172 in 1992. Black Africans didn't take part until the third modern games, held in St. Louis in 1908. Even this was accidental: Lentauw and Yamasami, Zulu tribesmen, entered the marathon because they happened to be in St. Louis as part of an exhibit about the Boer war. Lentauw finished ninth despite being chased into a cornfield by dogs. \n\n         Since all these are changes in how we live, not anything innate, we have to conclude that what we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes. Let us assume that our 1900 and 1990 12-year-olds are identical twins magically born 90 years apart. The 1990 girl still will grow up faster, end up bigger, menstruate earlier, and live longer than the 1900 girl. Perhaps way, way back in human history, when our forebears were still fleeing saber-toothed tigers, natural selection for athletic prowess came into play. But all that ended long ago. Indeed, the laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days: Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today's top athletes have fewer children than average. \n\n          Just because nurture has a more significant effect on athletic performance doesn't mean that nature lies dormant, though. Genetic variation exists for just about any trait you choose to study, and the ability to run quickly would be no exception. To take a trivial case, we know that the inheritance of extra fingers or toes is determined genetically. It is quite possible that the possession of an extra toe would hinder an aspiring miler--their genes have affected their athletic performance. One genetic factor that may be influencing performance trends is what is known as \"hybrid vigor.\" Cattle breeders have known about this for a long time: Take two inbred lines of cattle, cross them, and what you have is \"better\" (say, larger) than any single individual in either of the two parental lines. This does not require natural selection; it is the accidental byproduct of combining two previously isolated stocks. There are a number of theories to account for this at the genetic level, but it has proved difficult to discriminate among them. It is possible that modern humans exhibit some form of hybrid vigor simply because migration and admixture of populations are now occurring at unprecedented rates. Perhaps, just perhaps, such hybridization is being translated into enhanced performance. \n\n         That doesn't mean, however, that genetic differences in athletic ability can be correlated automatically with race. That is a claim that is impossible to test, because you cannot control, in an experimental sense, environmental differences among the study groups. Sure, you will find more Africans or descendants of Africans standing on the podiums at the end of Olympic track events. And you will find far fewer Asians on those same podiums. But can you, therefore, conclude that Africans have better genes for running than Asians do? No. Environmental differences between the two groups could account for differing levels of athletic success. It is scarcely surprising that Ethiopian or Kenyan distance runners do better than everyone else, since they are in the habit of running immense distances to and from primary school, middle school, and high school. The training is what's crucial, not the blackness. The Chinese sports establishment also has carried out an enormous, and effective, experiment to help dispel the myth that race has a direct relation to athletic ability. Until recently, a quick glance at the medals table confirmed every stereotype people held about Asians and sports. Then the Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners (and swimmers), and, boy, did they ever. In 1992, China ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal haul. \n\n         You can bring a single generation up to speed through training, but the trends we're dealing with transcend individual generations. Which brings us to another question: Will there come a time when the human machine will hit some sort of natural limit and an Olympic Games pass without a single record tumbling? In principle, yes. \n\n         There are some barriers that simply cannot be broken. We will never run a mile at the same speed at which we now run 100 meters, for instance. The laws of oxygen exchange will not permit it. Race horses seem already to have hit that outer limit. For years, they were as good as human athletes at pushing back speed records, but then they simply stopped getting faster. Take the prestigious British Derby. From 1850 to 1930, winning times dropped from 2:55 to 2:39. But from 1986 to 1996, the average time has been--2:39. Unlike people, race horses are specifically bred and reared to run. Generations of careful genetic selection have ensured that today's race horse has every possible speed-enhancing characteristic. Training techniques, too, are tremendously sophisticated. But you can go only so far. You can only breed horses with ultralight thin bones to a certain point; the bones will break under stress if they get any lighter. \n\n         Human improvement, like race-horse improvement, must eventually bow to the basic constraints of biomechanics. The age of menarche cannot keep on falling forever. On the other hand, it is clear from the remarkable demographic changes of just the past 20 years that these long-term trends are with us still. They may be slowing down in some more developed societies, but they roar along in others. And these trends will continue to fuel the improvement in athletic performance. Several new records will be set in Atlanta. And in Sydney in 2000, and wherever the Olympics are held in 2044. We will continue running faster and jumping further for a good long while to come.\n",

The Holy Grail of middle-distance running was his. Forty-two years later, however, that achievement seems less significant. Four-minute miles are commonplace; the current record, held by Algerian Noureddine Morceli, is 3:44 , more than 5 percent faster than Bannister's speed. What Iffley Road witnessed was just another step along the road to an ever quicker mile, part of the inexorable improvement of athletic performance that we usually take for granted, particularly when the Olympics roll around. If you stop to think about it, though, such constant progress is remarkable. After all, as biomechanical machines with a standard set of parts, humans should be subject to the same limitations we see in, say, automobiles. How come they aren't? \n\n         A lot of entrepreneurs and technophiles would like us to think that the answer has to do with discoveries in the world of sports technology. A new Nike shoe is trumpeted as something that will shave at least one-thousandth of a second off your 100-meter time. Trainers measure the rate of buildup of lactic acid in your muscles, then claim that their programs will control it. Nutritionists fine-tune athletes' diets. Even the old sexual-abstinence-before-the-race dogma is being re-evaluated under the all-seeing eye of science. But I consider all this little more than tinkering. Sports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the same today as they were in 1896, when the first modern Olympics took place. These minor miracles are the product neither of technology nor of training but of demographic patterns that affect us all. \n\n         Over the past century, the human race has been affected by a slew of what demographers call \"secular\" trends. (In this context, \"secular\" does not refer to a trend's lack of spirituality but to its longevity: Secular trends are long-term modifications, not just brief fluctuations.) One such trend is an increase in average size. You have to stoop to get through the doorways of a Tudor cottage in England because its inhabitants were smaller than you are, not because they had a penchant for crouching. Another trend is in life expectancy. People are living longer. Life expectancy in Africa increased over the past 20 years from 46 to 53 years. Over the same period in Europe, where things were already pretty comfortable to begin with, life expectancy increased from 71 to 75 years. The global average was an increase from 58 to 65 years. \n\n          Probably the most striking change, though, is how much more quickly children are maturing. A 12-year-old child in 1990 who was in what the World Health Organization calls \"average economic circumstances\" was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart. This is not solely the product of the first trend--the increase in average size--but also due to the fact that children develop faster. Girls menstruate earlier than they used to. The age of menarche (the onset of menstruation) has decreased by three or four months per decade in average sections of Western European populations for the past 150 years. There is a good chance that our 1990 12-year-old already had started to menstruate. Her 1900 counterpart would still have had three years to wait. \n\n         What do such trends have to do with athletic performance? Well, if we're living longer and growing up faster, that must mean we're producing bigger, better bodies. Better bodies imply faster miles. We run faster and faster for the same reason it is now common for 11-year-old girls to menstruate. But why are these things happening? \n\n          Demographers have offered a variety of explanations, but the main one is that our diet is improving. A 12-year-old ate better in 1990 than she would have in the Victorian era. This conclusion is supported by studies of the social elite: Because its members were well-nourished even in the early years of this century, this group has experienced relatively little change, over the past 100 years, in the age girls first menstruate. Another explanation is that health care is getting better. In 1991, according to the WHO, more than 75 percent of all 1-year-olds worldwide were immunized against a range of common diseases. Smallpox, that scourge of previous generations, now is effectively extinct. Probably the best measure of how much healthier we are is the rate of infant mortality, which measures both the health of the mother (a sickly mother is more likely to produce a sickly baby) and the health of the baby. In the past 20 years, infant mortality around the world has dropped from 92 deaths per 1000 live births to just 62. A lot of this can be chalked up to primary-heath-care programs in the developing world--the African average, for instance, has dropped from 135 deaths per 1000 births to 95. But there are also significant improvements in the developed world, with infant deaths dropping in Europe over the same 20-year period from 24 per 1000 live births to just 10. \n\n         Better health care affects athletic ability directly. This is true in the trivial case in which, say, antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race, but it may also be true in a more significant way. Diseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health--not necessarily a big one, but an impact nevertheless. Previous generations bore scars from all sorts of non-life-threatening diseases, the stuff everyone picked up as a baby. Nowadays, though, more and more people grow up with no history of disease. Since top athletes inevitably are drawn from the healthiest sector of the population, a generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from. You are much more likely to find someone who can run a mile in 3:30 in a sample of several million superbly healthy people than you are in a sample of 10,000. \n\n         The pool of potential athletes has expanded in other ways, too. First, the population has exploded. Second, we are coming ever closer to a worldwide middle class, the class from which athletes typically are drawn. Whether, in an age of multinational capitalism, we may talk reasonably about a post-colonial era is way beyond the scope of this article. The fact remains, however, that the developing world is doing just that--developing. Even Mozambique, which ranks at, or near, the bottom of national per capita gross national product tables, has shown an increase of some 20 percent in adult literacy rates over the past 20 years. Literacy rates are merely an index of education, which itself is another way of talking about a global move away from a hand-to-mouth lifestyle. \n\n         The decline of empire has its Olympic corollaries. Britain won, on average, 17 gold medals per Olympics in the five official games held in its imperial heyday before World War I. That average has dropped to only five medals per Olympics in the 17 held since. This is not a reflection of declining athletic standards in Britain, however; it's a function of how much more competitive other nations have become. The Olympics originally were the preserve of the socioeconomic elite of the socioeconomic elite among nations. Consider this: Only 13 nations participated in 1896, but there were 172 in 1992. Black Africans didn't take part until the third modern games, held in St. Louis in 1908. Even this was accidental: Lentauw and Yamasami, Zulu tribesmen, entered the marathon because they happened to be in St. Louis as part of an exhibit about the Boer war. Lentauw finished ninth despite being chased into a cornfield by dogs. \n\n         Since all these are changes in how we live, not anything innate, we have to conclude that what we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes. Let us assume that our 1900 and 1990 12-year-olds are identical twins magically born 90 years apart. The 1990 girl still will grow up faster, end up bigger, menstruate earlier, and live longer than the 1900 girl. Perhaps way, way back in human history, when our forebears were still fleeing saber-toothed tigers, natural selection for athletic prowess came into play. But all that ended long ago. Indeed, the laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days: Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today's top athletes have fewer children than average. \n\n          Just because nurture has a more significant effect on athletic performance doesn't mean that nature lies dormant, though. Genetic variation exists for just about any trait you choose to study, and the ability to run quickly would be no exception. To take a trivial case, we know that the inheritance of extra fingers or toes is determined genetically. It is quite possible that the possession of an extra toe would hinder an aspiring miler--their genes have affected their athletic performance. One genetic factor that may be influencing performance trends is what is known as \"hybrid vigor.\" Cattle breeders have known about this for a long time: Take two inbred lines of cattle, cross them, and what you have is \"better\" (say, larger) than any single individual in either of the two parental lines. This does not require natural selection; it is the accidental byproduct of combining two previously isolated stocks. There are a number of theories to account for this at the genetic level, but it has proved difficult to discriminate among them. It is possible that modern humans exhibit some form of hybrid vigor simply because migration and admixture of populations are now occurring at unprecedented rates. Perhaps, just perhaps, such hybridization is being translated into enhanced performance. \n\n         That doesn't mean, however, that genetic differences in athletic ability can be correlated automatically with race. That is a claim that is impossible to test, because you cannot control, in an experimental sense, environmental differences among the study groups. Sure, you will find more Africans or descendants of Africans standing on the podiums at the end of Olympic track events. And you will find far fewer Asians on those same podiums. But can you, therefore, conclude that Africans have better genes for running than Asians do? No. Environmental differences between the two groups could account for differing levels of athletic success. It is scarcely surprising that Ethiopian or Kenyan distance runners do better than everyone else, since they are in the habit of running immense distances to and from primary school, middle school, and high school. The training is what's crucial, not the blackness. The Chinese sports establishment also has carried out an enormous, and effective, experiment to help dispel the myth that race has a direct relation to athletic ability. Until recently, a quick glance at the medals table confirmed every stereotype people held about Asians and sports. Then the Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners (and swimmers), and, boy, did they ever. In 1992, China ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal haul. \n\n         You can bring a single generation up to speed through training, but the trends we're dealing with transcend individual generations. Which brings us to another question: Will there come a time when the human machine will hit some sort of natural limit and an Olympic Games pass without a single record tumbling? In principle, yes. \n\n         There are some barriers that simply cannot be broken. We will never run a mile at the same speed at which we now run 100 meters, for instance. The laws of oxygen exchange will not permit it. Race horses seem already to have hit that outer limit. For years, they were as good as human athletes at pushing back speed records, but then they simply stopped getting faster. Take the prestigious British Derby. From 1850 to 1930, winning times dropped from 2:55 to 2:39. But from 1986 to 1996, the average time has been--2:39. Unlike people, race horses are specifically bred and reared to run. Generations of careful genetic selection have ensured that today's race horse has every possible speed-enhancing characteristic. Training techniques, too, are tremendously sophisticated. But you can go only so far. You can only breed horses with ultralight thin bones to a certain point; the bones will break under stress if they get any lighter. \n\n         Human improvement, like race-horse improvement, must eventually bow to the basic constraints of biomechanics. The age of menarche cannot keep on falling forever. On the other hand, it is clear from the remarkable demographic changes of just the past 20 years that these long-term trends are with us still. They may be slowing down in some more developed societies, but they roar along in others. And these trends will continue to fuel the improvement in athletic performance. Several new records will be set in Atlanta. And in Sydney in 2000, and wherever the Olympics are held in 2044. We will continue running faster and jumping further for a good long while to come.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow does improved medical care impact athletic ability?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Only directly\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Directly and indirectly\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Directly and indirectly\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Directly and indirectly\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

The Holy Grail of middle-distance running was his. Forty-two years later, however, that achievement seems less significant. Four-minute miles are commonplace; the current record, held by Algerian Noureddine Morceli, is 3:44 , more than 5 percent faster than Bannister's speed. What Iffley Road witnessed was just another step along the road to an ever quicker mile, part of the inexorable improvement of athletic performance that we usually take for granted, particularly when the Olympics roll around. If you stop to think about it, though, such constant progress is remarkable. After all, as biomechanical machines with a standard set of parts, humans should be subject to the same limitations we see in, say, automobiles. How come they aren't? \n\n         A lot of entrepreneurs and technophiles would like us to think that the answer has to do with discoveries in the world of sports technology. A new Nike shoe is trumpeted as something that will shave at least one-thousandth of a second off your 100-meter time. Trainers measure the rate of buildup of lactic acid in your muscles, then claim that their programs will control it. Nutritionists fine-tune athletes' diets. Even the old sexual-abstinence-before-the-race dogma is being re-evaluated under the all-seeing eye of science. But I consider all this little more than tinkering. Sports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the same today as they were in 1896, when the first modern Olympics took place. These minor miracles are the product neither of technology nor of training but of demographic patterns that affect us all. \n\n         Over the past century, the human race has been affected by a slew of what demographers call \"secular\" trends. (In this context, \"secular\" does not refer to a trend's lack of spirituality but to its longevity: Secular trends are long-term modifications, not just brief fluctuations.) One such trend is an increase in average size. You have to stoop to get through the doorways of a Tudor cottage in England because its inhabitants were smaller than you are, not because they had a penchant for crouching. Another trend is in life expectancy. People are living longer. Life expectancy in Africa increased over the past 20 years from 46 to 53 years. Over the same period in Europe, where things were already pretty comfortable to begin with, life expectancy increased from 71 to 75 years. The global average was an increase from 58 to 65 years. \n\n          Probably the most striking change, though, is how much more quickly children are maturing. A 12-year-old child in 1990 who was in what the World Health Organization calls \"average economic circumstances\" was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart. This is not solely the product of the first trend--the increase in average size--but also due to the fact that children develop faster. Girls menstruate earlier than they used to. The age of menarche (the onset of menstruation) has decreased by three or four months per decade in average sections of Western European populations for the past 150 years. There is a good chance that our 1990 12-year-old already had started to menstruate. Her 1900 counterpart would still have had three years to wait. \n\n         What do such trends have to do with athletic performance? Well, if we're living longer and growing up faster, that must mean we're producing bigger, better bodies. Better bodies imply faster miles. We run faster and faster for the same reason it is now common for 11-year-old girls to menstruate. But why are these things happening? \n\n          Demographers have offered a variety of explanations, but the main one is that our diet is improving. A 12-year-old ate better in 1990 than she would have in the Victorian era. This conclusion is supported by studies of the social elite: Because its members were well-nourished even in the early years of this century, this group has experienced relatively little change, over the past 100 years, in the age girls first menstruate. Another explanation is that health care is getting better. In 1991, according to the WHO, more than 75 percent of all 1-year-olds worldwide were immunized against a range of common diseases. Smallpox, that scourge of previous generations, now is effectively extinct. Probably the best measure of how much healthier we are is the rate of infant mortality, which measures both the health of the mother (a sickly mother is more likely to produce a sickly baby) and the health of the baby. In the past 20 years, infant mortality around the world has dropped from 92 deaths per 1000 live births to just 62. A lot of this can be chalked up to primary-heath-care programs in the developing world--the African average, for instance, has dropped from 135 deaths per 1000 births to 95. But there are also significant improvements in the developed world, with infant deaths dropping in Europe over the same 20-year period from 24 per 1000 live births to just 10. \n\n         Better health care affects athletic ability directly. This is true in the trivial case in which, say, antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race, but it may also be true in a more significant way. Diseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health--not necessarily a big one, but an impact nevertheless. Previous generations bore scars from all sorts of non-life-threatening diseases, the stuff everyone picked up as a baby. Nowadays, though, more and more people grow up with no history of disease. Since top athletes inevitably are drawn from the healthiest sector of the population, a generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from. You are much more likely to find someone who can run a mile in 3:30 in a sample of several million superbly healthy people than you are in a sample of 10,000. \n\n         The pool of potential athletes has expanded in other ways, too. First, the population has exploded. Second, we are coming ever closer to a worldwide middle class, the class from which athletes typically are drawn. Whether, in an age of multinational capitalism, we may talk reasonably about a post-colonial era is way beyond the scope of this article. The fact remains, however, that the developing world is doing just that--developing. Even Mozambique, which ranks at, or near, the bottom of national per capita gross national product tables, has shown an increase of some 20 percent in adult literacy rates over the past 20 years. Literacy rates are merely an index of education, which itself is another way of talking about a global move away from a hand-to-mouth lifestyle. \n\n         The decline of empire has its Olympic corollaries. Britain won, on average, 17 gold medals per Olympics in the five official games held in its imperial heyday before World War I. That average has dropped to only five medals per Olympics in the 17 held since. This is not a reflection of declining athletic standards in Britain, however; it's a function of how much more competitive other nations have become. The Olympics originally were the preserve of the socioeconomic elite of the socioeconomic elite among nations. Consider this: Only 13 nations participated in 1896, but there were 172 in 1992. Black Africans didn't take part until the third modern games, held in St. Louis in 1908. Even this was accidental: Lentauw and Yamasami, Zulu tribesmen, entered the marathon because they happened to be in St. Louis as part of an exhibit about the Boer war. Lentauw finished ninth despite being chased into a cornfield by dogs. \n\n         Since all these are changes in how we live, not anything innate, we have to conclude that what we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes. Let us assume that our 1900 and 1990 12-year-olds are identical twins magically born 90 years apart. The 1990 girl still will grow up faster, end up bigger, menstruate earlier, and live longer than the 1900 girl. Perhaps way, way back in human history, when our forebears were still fleeing saber-toothed tigers, natural selection for athletic prowess came into play. But all that ended long ago. Indeed, the laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days: Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today's top athletes have fewer children than average. \n\n          Just because nurture has a more significant effect on athletic performance doesn't mean that nature lies dormant, though. Genetic variation exists for just about any trait you choose to study, and the ability to run quickly would be no exception. To take a trivial case, we know that the inheritance of extra fingers or toes is determined genetically. It is quite possible that the possession of an extra toe would hinder an aspiring miler--their genes have affected their athletic performance. One genetic factor that may be influencing performance trends is what is known as \"hybrid vigor.\" Cattle breeders have known about this for a long time: Take two inbred lines of cattle, cross them, and what you have is \"better\" (say, larger) than any single individual in either of the two parental lines. This does not require natural selection; it is the accidental byproduct of combining two previously isolated stocks. There are a number of theories to account for this at the genetic level, but it has proved difficult to discriminate among them. It is possible that modern humans exhibit some form of hybrid vigor simply because migration and admixture of populations are now occurring at unprecedented rates. Perhaps, just perhaps, such hybridization is being translated into enhanced performance. \n\n         That doesn't mean, however, that genetic differences in athletic ability can be correlated automatically with race. That is a claim that is impossible to test, because you cannot control, in an experimental sense, environmental differences among the study groups. Sure, you will find more Africans or descendants of Africans standing on the podiums at the end of Olympic track events. And you will find far fewer Asians on those same podiums. But can you, therefore, conclude that Africans have better genes for running than Asians do? No. Environmental differences between the two groups could account for differing levels of athletic success. It is scarcely surprising that Ethiopian or Kenyan distance runners do better than everyone else, since they are in the habit of running immense distances to and from primary school, middle school, and high school. The training is what's crucial, not the blackness. The Chinese sports establishment also has carried out an enormous, and effective, experiment to help dispel the myth that race has a direct relation to athletic ability. Until recently, a quick glance at the medals table confirmed every stereotype people held about Asians and sports. Then the Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners (and swimmers), and, boy, did they ever. In 1992, China ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal haul. \n\n         You can bring a single generation up to speed through training, but the trends we're dealing with transcend individual generations. Which brings us to another question: Will there come a time when the human machine will hit some sort of natural limit and an Olympic Games pass without a single record tumbling? In principle, yes. \n\n         There are some barriers that simply cannot be broken. We will never run a mile at the same speed at which we now run 100 meters, for instance. The laws of oxygen exchange will not permit it. Race horses seem already to have hit that outer limit. For years, they were as good as human athletes at pushing back speed records, but then they simply stopped getting faster. Take the prestigious British Derby. From 1850 to 1930, winning times dropped from 2:55 to 2:39. But from 1986 to 1996, the average time has been--2:39. Unlike people, race horses are specifically bred and reared to run. Generations of careful genetic selection have ensured that today's race horse has every possible speed-enhancing characteristic. Training techniques, too, are tremendously sophisticated. But you can go only so far. You can only breed horses with ultralight thin bones to a certain point; the bones will break under stress if they get any lighter. \n\n         Human improvement, like race-horse improvement, must eventually bow to the basic constraints of biomechanics. The age of menarche cannot keep on falling forever. On the other hand, it is clear from the remarkable demographic changes of just the past 20 years that these long-term trends are with us still. They may be slowing down in some more developed societies, but they roar along in others. And these trends will continue to fuel the improvement in athletic performance. Several new records will be set in Atlanta. And in Sydney in 2000, and wherever the Olympics are held in 2044. We will continue running faster and jumping further for a good long while to come.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow does improved medical care impact athletic ability?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Directly and indirectly\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Only directly\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Only directly\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Only directly\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

The Holy Grail of middle-distance running was his. Forty-two years later, however, that achievement seems less significant. Four-minute miles are commonplace; the current record, held by Algerian Noureddine Morceli, is 3:44 , more than 5 percent faster than Bannister's speed. What Iffley Road witnessed was just another step along the road to an ever quicker mile, part of the inexorable improvement of athletic performance that we usually take for granted, particularly when the Olympics roll around. If you stop to think about it, though, such constant progress is remarkable. After all, as biomechanical machines with a standard set of parts, humans should be subject to the same limitations we see in, say, automobiles. How come they aren't? \n\n         A lot of entrepreneurs and technophiles would like us to think that the answer has to do with discoveries in the world of sports technology. A new Nike shoe is trumpeted as something that will shave at least one-thousandth of a second off your 100-meter time. Trainers measure the rate of buildup of lactic acid in your muscles, then claim that their programs will control it. Nutritionists fine-tune athletes' diets. Even the old sexual-abstinence-before-the-race dogma is being re-evaluated under the all-seeing eye of science. But I consider all this little more than tinkering. Sports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the same today as they were in 1896, when the first modern Olympics took place. These minor miracles are the product neither of technology nor of training but of demographic patterns that affect us all. \n\n         Over the past century, the human race has been affected by a slew of what demographers call \"secular\" trends. (In this context, \"secular\" does not refer to a trend's lack of spirituality but to its longevity: Secular trends are long-term modifications, not just brief fluctuations.) One such trend is an increase in average size. You have to stoop to get through the doorways of a Tudor cottage in England because its inhabitants were smaller than you are, not because they had a penchant for crouching. Another trend is in life expectancy. People are living longer. Life expectancy in Africa increased over the past 20 years from 46 to 53 years. Over the same period in Europe, where things were already pretty comfortable to begin with, life expectancy increased from 71 to 75 years. The global average was an increase from 58 to 65 years. \n\n          Probably the most striking change, though, is how much more quickly children are maturing. A 12-year-old child in 1990 who was in what the World Health Organization calls \"average economic circumstances\" was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart. This is not solely the product of the first trend--the increase in average size--but also due to the fact that children develop faster. Girls menstruate earlier than they used to. The age of menarche (the onset of menstruation) has decreased by three or four months per decade in average sections of Western European populations for the past 150 years. There is a good chance that our 1990 12-year-old already had started to menstruate. Her 1900 counterpart would still have had three years to wait. \n\n         What do such trends have to do with athletic performance? Well, if we're living longer and growing up faster, that must mean we're producing bigger, better bodies. Better bodies imply faster miles. We run faster and faster for the same reason it is now common for 11-year-old girls to menstruate. But why are these things happening? \n\n          Demographers have offered a variety of explanations, but the main one is that our diet is improving. A 12-year-old ate better in 1990 than she would have in the Victorian era. This conclusion is supported by studies of the social elite: Because its members were well-nourished even in the early years of this century, this group has experienced relatively little change, over the past 100 years, in the age girls first menstruate. Another explanation is that health care is getting better. In 1991, according to the WHO, more than 75 percent of all 1-year-olds worldwide were immunized against a range of common diseases. Smallpox, that scourge of previous generations, now is effectively extinct. Probably the best measure of how much healthier we are is the rate of infant mortality, which measures both the health of the mother (a sickly mother is more likely to produce a sickly baby) and the health of the baby. In the past 20 years, infant mortality around the world has dropped from 92 deaths per 1000 live births to just 62. A lot of this can be chalked up to primary-heath-care programs in the developing world--the African average, for instance, has dropped from 135 deaths per 1000 births to 95. But there are also significant improvements in the developed world, with infant deaths dropping in Europe over the same 20-year period from 24 per 1000 live births to just 10. \n\n         Better health care affects athletic ability directly. This is true in the trivial case in which, say, antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race, but it may also be true in a more significant way. Diseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health--not necessarily a big one, but an impact nevertheless. Previous generations bore scars from all sorts of non-life-threatening diseases, the stuff everyone picked up as a baby. Nowadays, though, more and more people grow up with no history of disease. Since top athletes inevitably are drawn from the healthiest sector of the population, a generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from. You are much more likely to find someone who can run a mile in 3:30 in a sample of several million superbly healthy people than you are in a sample of 10,000. \n\n         The pool of potential athletes has expanded in other ways, too. First, the population has exploded. Second, we are coming ever closer to a worldwide middle class, the class from which athletes typically are drawn. Whether, in an age of multinational capitalism, we may talk reasonably about a post-colonial era is way beyond the scope of this article. The fact remains, however, that the developing world is doing just that--developing. Even Mozambique, which ranks at, or near, the bottom of national per capita gross national product tables, has shown an increase of some 20 percent in adult literacy rates over the past 20 years. Literacy rates are merely an index of education, which itself is another way of talking about a global move away from a hand-to-mouth lifestyle. \n\n         The decline of empire has its Olympic corollaries. Britain won, on average, 17 gold medals per Olympics in the five official games held in its imperial heyday before World War I. That average has dropped to only five medals per Olympics in the 17 held since. This is not a reflection of declining athletic standards in Britain, however; it's a function of how much more competitive other nations have become. The Olympics originally were the preserve of the socioeconomic elite of the socioeconomic elite among nations. Consider this: Only 13 nations participated in 1896, but there were 172 in 1992. Black Africans didn't take part until the third modern games, held in St. Louis in 1908. Even this was accidental: Lentauw and Yamasami, Zulu tribesmen, entered the marathon because they happened to be in St. Louis as part of an exhibit about the Boer war. Lentauw finished ninth despite being chased into a cornfield by dogs. \n\n         Since all these are changes in how we live, not anything innate, we have to conclude that what we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes. Let us assume that our 1900 and 1990 12-year-olds are identical twins magically born 90 years apart. The 1990 girl still will grow up faster, end up bigger, menstruate earlier, and live longer than the 1900 girl. Perhaps way, way back in human history, when our forebears were still fleeing saber-toothed tigers, natural selection for athletic prowess came into play. But all that ended long ago. Indeed, the laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days: Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today's top athletes have fewer children than average. \n\n          Just because nurture has a more significant effect on athletic performance doesn't mean that nature lies dormant, though. Genetic variation exists for just about any trait you choose to study, and the ability to run quickly would be no exception. To take a trivial case, we know that the inheritance of extra fingers or toes is determined genetically. It is quite possible that the possession of an extra toe would hinder an aspiring miler--their genes have affected their athletic performance. One genetic factor that may be influencing performance trends is what is known as \"hybrid vigor.\" Cattle breeders have known about this for a long time: Take two inbred lines of cattle, cross them, and what you have is \"better\" (say, larger) than any single individual in either of the two parental lines. This does not require natural selection; it is the accidental byproduct of combining two previously isolated stocks. There are a number of theories to account for this at the genetic level, but it has proved difficult to discriminate among them. It is possible that modern humans exhibit some form of hybrid vigor simply because migration and admixture of populations are now occurring at unprecedented rates. Perhaps, just perhaps, such hybridization is being translated into enhanced performance. \n\n         That doesn't mean, however, that genetic differences in athletic ability can be correlated automatically with race. That is a claim that is impossible to test, because you cannot control, in an experimental sense, environmental differences among the study groups. Sure, you will find more Africans or descendants of Africans standing on the podiums at the end of Olympic track events. And you will find far fewer Asians on those same podiums. But can you, therefore, conclude that Africans have better genes for running than Asians do? No. Environmental differences between the two groups could account for differing levels of athletic success. It is scarcely surprising that Ethiopian or Kenyan distance runners do better than everyone else, since they are in the habit of running immense distances to and from primary school, middle school, and high school. The training is what's crucial, not the blackness. The Chinese sports establishment also has carried out an enormous, and effective, experiment to help dispel the myth that race has a direct relation to athletic ability. Until recently, a quick glance at the medals table confirmed every stereotype people held about Asians and sports. Then the Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners (and swimmers), and, boy, did they ever. In 1992, China ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal haul. \n\n         You can bring a single generation up to speed through training, but the trends we're dealing with transcend individual generations. Which brings us to another question: Will there come a time when the human machine will hit some sort of natural limit and an Olympic Games pass without a single record tumbling? In principle, yes. \n\n         There are some barriers that simply cannot be broken. We will never run a mile at the same speed at which we now run 100 meters, for instance. The laws of oxygen exchange will not permit it. Race horses seem already to have hit that outer limit. For years, they were as good as human athletes at pushing back speed records, but then they simply stopped getting faster. Take the prestigious British Derby. From 1850 to 1930, winning times dropped from 2:55 to 2:39. But from 1986 to 1996, the average time has been--2:39. Unlike people, race horses are specifically bred and reared to run. Generations of careful genetic selection have ensured that today's race horse has every possible speed-enhancing characteristic. Training techniques, too, are tremendously sophisticated. But you can go only so far. You can only breed horses with ultralight thin bones to a certain point; the bones will break under stress if they get any lighter. \n\n         Human improvement, like race-horse improvement, must eventually bow to the basic constraints of biomechanics. The age of menarche cannot keep on falling forever. On the other hand, it is clear from the remarkable demographic changes of just the past 20 years that these long-term trends are with us still. They may be slowing down in some more developed societies, but they roar along in others. And these trends will continue to fuel the improvement in athletic performance. Several new records will be set in Atlanta. And in Sydney in 2000, and wherever the Olympics are held in 2044. We will continue running faster and jumping further for a good long while to come.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow does improved medical care impact athletic ability?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Only directly\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Directly and indirectly\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Directly and indirectly\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. Claim: Improved medical care enhances athletic ability directly  \n   a. Antibiotic and vaccine effects  \n      \u2013 <invalid_quote>\"More than 75 percent of all 1-year-olds \u2026 were immunized \u2026 Smallpox \u2026 now is effectively extinct.\"</invalid_quote> ensures athletes start races free of impairing infections. (Berry \u00a76)  \n      \u2013 Prompt treatment of fever or injury immediately before competition prevents performance decrements.  \n   b. Disease-free development  \n      \u2013 <invalid_quote>\"Diseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health \u2026 Nowadays \u2026 more and more people grow up with no history of disease.\"</invalid_quote> (Berry \u00a76)  \n      \u2013 Top athletes drawn from healthiest cohort; eliminating subclinical insults in infancy raises ceiling on maximal aerobic capacity, muscle development, and recovery.  \n\n2. Claim: Improved medical care enhances athletic ability indirectly via secular demographic trends  \n   a. Faster maturation and greater physical development  \n      \u2013 <invalid_quote>\"A 12-year-old \u2026 in 1990 \u2026 was about 9 inches taller than his \u2026 1900 counterpart \u2026 children develop faster.\"</invalid_quote> (Berry \u00a73)  \n      \u2013 Earlier growth spurts and menarche translate to more years of advanced training and biomechanical optimization before peak athletic age.  \n   b. Increased life expectancy leading to larger competitive pool  \n      \u2013 <invalid_quote>\"Life expectancy in Africa increased \u2026 from 46 to 53 \u2026 global average \u2026 from 58 to 65 years.\"</invalid_quote> (Berry \u00a72)  \n      \u2013 More individuals survive into the age range where specialized training occurs, enabling records to tumble.  \n   c.

Refutation of Debater_B\u2019s \u201cOnly directly\u201d position  \n   a. Overlooks childhood developmental trends  \n      \u2013 If medical care only mattered on race day, why did childhood height and maturation rates parallel performance trends? (Berry \u00a7\u00a72\u20133)  \n   b. Ignores demographic pool effect  \n      \u2013 Even elite training yields limited improvement unless powered by a continually replenished, healthy cohort. Race horses plateau despite \u201cdirect\u201d training because population genetic variance is fixed. Humans benefit from indirect secular growth. (Berry \u00a710)  \n   c. Contradicts lack of plateau in records  \n      \u2013 Debater_B cannot explain why records continue to fall across generations even when direct interventions (shoes, training) show diminishing returns. The secular trends (indirect) remain potent. (Berry \u00a7\u00a71, 11)  \n\nConclusion  \nImproved medical care is not a mere \u201crace-day\u201d booster. It fundamentally reshapes human development, survival, and population genetics, indirectly fueling the incessant improvement in athletic performance alongside its direct benefits. Only the \u201cdirect and indirect\u201d model accounts for the longstanding, unbroken trend of ever-faster times and greater achievements.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Definition of \u201cDirect\u201d vs. \u201cIndirect\u201d  \n   a. Direct effect: medical care enhances an individual athlete\u2019s performance within his or her own lifetime by preventing or curing disease, reducing downtime, and preserving maximal physiological function.  \n   b. Indirect effect: improvements that accrue only through multi\u2010generational changes in the gene pool, population selection, or demographic shifts.  \n\n2. Core Argument: Medical care impacts athletic ability only directly  \n   2.1. Textual support for the direct role  \n     \u2022 \u201cAntibiotics cure a runner\u2019s fever before the big race\u201d (<quote>Better health care affects athletic ability directly</quote>). Enabling immediate training and competition.  \n     \u2022 \u201cA generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from\u201d (<invalid_quote>more and more people grow up with no history of disease\u2026 a generally superior system\u2026</invalid_quote>). This is still a direct effect: every healthier individual is capable of training. You do not need generations to \u201cindirectly\u201d improve genes.  \n   2.2. Absence of generational, gene\u2010level change  \n     \u2022 The author explicitly rejects natural selection as a driver: \u201cPerhaps way, way back\u2026 natural selection for athletic prowess\u2026 ended long ago\u201d (<quote>all that ended long ago</quote>).  \n     \u2022 Race\u2010horse comparison: despite millennia of breeding, horses have plateaued (\u201cfrom 1986 to 1996\u2026 average time\u20262:39\u201d), demonstrating that genetic improvements require intensive selection. Human medical care is far less targeted\u2014thus no indirect, multi\u2010generational advantage.  \n\n3. Demographic and Secular Trends Driven by Nutrition, Not Medical Care  \n   3.1. Nutrition vs. health care  \n     \u2022 \u201cDiet is improving\u201d is the \u201cmain\u201d explanation for size and maturation trends (<quote>main one is that our diet is improving</quote>). Nutrition requires food supply and economic development, not health care.  \n     \u2022 Secular increases in height and earlier menarche result from caloric and protein intake, not just immunizations. Elite social class, well\u2010nourished since 1900, has \u201cexperienced relatively little change\u201d (<quote>has experienced relatively little change,</quote>), showing health care alone does not drive these trends.  \n   3.2. Population growth and middle\u2010class rise are economic, not medical  \n     \u2022 \u201cPopulation has exploded\u2026 coming closer to a worldwide middle class\u201d (<invalid_quote>population has exploded\u2026 middle class</invalid_quote>). Economic development and education, not medical care, cause these demographic shifts.  \n\n4. Countering Debater_A\u2019s \u201cIndirect\u201d Claim  \n   4.1. Confusing correlation with causation  \n     \u2022 Debater_A misattributes multi\u2010generational secular trends (nutrition, sanitation, education, rising prosperity) to medical care. But the text calls diet \u201cmain one\u201d and cites primary\u2010health\u2010care only to explain infant mortality declines, a minor portion of overall secular trends.  \n   4.2. Lack of gene\u2010pool evidence  \n     \u2022 Hybrid vigor is \u201cpossible\u201d but \u201cdifficult to discriminate\u201d and not tied to modern medical care (<invalid_quote>perhaps\u2026 hybrid vigor\u2026 possible</invalid_quote>). Debater_A offers no empirical data showing medical care drives admixture or gene flow.  \n   4.3. Single\u2010generation Chinese experiment  \n     \u2022 China\u2019s rapid record\u2010setting via training (<quote>Chinese decided to produce record-breaking </quote>) shows environment and medical support (to keep athletes healthy) yield immediate gains, not gene\u2010pool changes.  \n\n5. Conclusion  \n   \u2022 All cited Olympic improvements from 1950s to present occur within a few generations via better health care preventing disease, enabling training, and expanding the healthy athlete pool.  \n   \u2022 Long\u2010term secular changes in body size and maturation\u2014key to ultimate performance ceilings\u2014derive predominantly from nutrition and economic development.  \n   \u2022 Therefore, improved medical care impacts athletic ability only directly, not indirectly through gene\u2010pool or lasting secular trends.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Directly and indirectly\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

The Holy Grail of middle-distance running was his. Forty-two years later, however, that achievement seems less significant. Four-minute miles are commonplace; the current record, held by Algerian Noureddine Morceli, is 3:44 , more than 5 percent faster than Bannister's speed. What Iffley Road witnessed was just another step along the road to an ever quicker mile, part of the inexorable improvement of athletic performance that we usually take for granted, particularly when the Olympics roll around. If you stop to think about it, though, such constant progress is remarkable. After all, as biomechanical machines with a standard set of parts, humans should be subject to the same limitations we see in, say, automobiles. How come they aren't? \n\n         A lot of entrepreneurs and technophiles would like us to think that the answer has to do with discoveries in the world of sports technology. A new Nike shoe is trumpeted as something that will shave at least one-thousandth of a second off your 100-meter time. Trainers measure the rate of buildup of lactic acid in your muscles, then claim that their programs will control it. Nutritionists fine-tune athletes' diets. Even the old sexual-abstinence-before-the-race dogma is being re-evaluated under the all-seeing eye of science. But I consider all this little more than tinkering. Sports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the same today as they were in 1896, when the first modern Olympics took place. These minor miracles are the product neither of technology nor of training but of demographic patterns that affect us all. \n\n         Over the past century, the human race has been affected by a slew of what demographers call \"secular\" trends. (In this context, \"secular\" does not refer to a trend's lack of spirituality but to its longevity: Secular trends are long-term modifications, not just brief fluctuations.) One such trend is an increase in average size. You have to stoop to get through the doorways of a Tudor cottage in England because its inhabitants were smaller than you are, not because they had a penchant for crouching. Another trend is in life expectancy. People are living longer. Life expectancy in Africa increased over the past 20 years from 46 to 53 years. Over the same period in Europe, where things were already pretty comfortable to begin with, life expectancy increased from 71 to 75 years. The global average was an increase from 58 to 65 years. \n\n          Probably the most striking change, though, is how much more quickly children are maturing. A 12-year-old child in 1990 who was in what the World Health Organization calls \"average economic circumstances\" was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart. This is not solely the product of the first trend--the increase in average size--but also due to the fact that children develop faster. Girls menstruate earlier than they used to. The age of menarche (the onset of menstruation) has decreased by three or four months per decade in average sections of Western European populations for the past 150 years. There is a good chance that our 1990 12-year-old already had started to menstruate. Her 1900 counterpart would still have had three years to wait. \n\n         What do such trends have to do with athletic performance? Well, if we're living longer and growing up faster, that must mean we're producing bigger, better bodies. Better bodies imply faster miles. We run faster and faster for the same reason it is now common for 11-year-old girls to menstruate. But why are these things happening? \n\n          Demographers have offered a variety of explanations, but the main one is that our diet is improving. A 12-year-old ate better in 1990 than she would have in the Victorian era. This conclusion is supported by studies of the social elite: Because its members were well-nourished even in the early years of this century, this group has experienced relatively little change, over the past 100 years, in the age girls first menstruate. Another explanation is that health care is getting better. In 1991, according to the WHO, more than 75 percent of all 1-year-olds worldwide were immunized against a range of common diseases. Smallpox, that scourge of previous generations, now is effectively extinct. Probably the best measure of how much healthier we are is the rate of infant mortality, which measures both the health of the mother (a sickly mother is more likely to produce a sickly baby) and the health of the baby. In the past 20 years, infant mortality around the world has dropped from 92 deaths per 1000 live births to just 62. A lot of this can be chalked up to primary-heath-care programs in the developing world--the African average, for instance, has dropped from 135 deaths per 1000 births to 95. But there are also significant improvements in the developed world, with infant deaths dropping in Europe over the same 20-year period from 24 per 1000 live births to just 10. \n\n         Better health care affects athletic ability directly. This is true in the trivial case in which, say, antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race, but it may also be true in a more significant way. Diseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health--not necessarily a big one, but an impact nevertheless. Previous generations bore scars from all sorts of non-life-threatening diseases, the stuff everyone picked up as a baby. Nowadays, though, more and more people grow up with no history of disease. Since top athletes inevitably are drawn from the healthiest sector of the population, a generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from. You are much more likely to find someone who can run a mile in 3:30 in a sample of several million superbly healthy people than you are in a sample of 10,000. \n\n         The pool of potential athletes has expanded in other ways, too. First, the population has exploded. Second, we are coming ever closer to a worldwide middle class, the class from which athletes typically are drawn. Whether, in an age of multinational capitalism, we may talk reasonably about a post-colonial era is way beyond the scope of this article. The fact remains, however, that the developing world is doing just that--developing. Even Mozambique, which ranks at, or near, the bottom of national per capita gross national product tables, has shown an increase of some 20 percent in adult literacy rates over the past 20 years. Literacy rates are merely an index of education, which itself is another way of talking about a global move away from a hand-to-mouth lifestyle. \n\n         The decline of empire has its Olympic corollaries. Britain won, on average, 17 gold medals per Olympics in the five official games held in its imperial heyday before World War I. That average has dropped to only five medals per Olympics in the 17 held since. This is not a reflection of declining athletic standards in Britain, however; it's a function of how much more competitive other nations have become. The Olympics originally were the preserve of the socioeconomic elite of the socioeconomic elite among nations. Consider this: Only 13 nations participated in 1896, but there were 172 in 1992. Black Africans didn't take part until the third modern games, held in St. Louis in 1908. Even this was accidental: Lentauw and Yamasami, Zulu tribesmen, entered the marathon because they happened to be in St. Louis as part of an exhibit about the Boer war. Lentauw finished ninth despite being chased into a cornfield by dogs. \n\n         Since all these are changes in how we live, not anything innate, we have to conclude that what we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes. Let us assume that our 1900 and 1990 12-year-olds are identical twins magically born 90 years apart. The 1990 girl still will grow up faster, end up bigger, menstruate earlier, and live longer than the 1900 girl. Perhaps way, way back in human history, when our forebears were still fleeing saber-toothed tigers, natural selection for athletic prowess came into play. But all that ended long ago. Indeed, the laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days: Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today's top athletes have fewer children than average. \n\n          Just because nurture has a more significant effect on athletic performance doesn't mean that nature lies dormant, though. Genetic variation exists for just about any trait you choose to study, and the ability to run quickly would be no exception. To take a trivial case, we know that the inheritance of extra fingers or toes is determined genetically. It is quite possible that the possession of an extra toe would hinder an aspiring miler--their genes have affected their athletic performance. One genetic factor that may be influencing performance trends is what is known as \"hybrid vigor.\" Cattle breeders have known about this for a long time: Take two inbred lines of cattle, cross them, and what you have is \"better\" (say, larger) than any single individual in either of the two parental lines. This does not require natural selection; it is the accidental byproduct of combining two previously isolated stocks. There are a number of theories to account for this at the genetic level, but it has proved difficult to discriminate among them. It is possible that modern humans exhibit some form of hybrid vigor simply because migration and admixture of populations are now occurring at unprecedented rates. Perhaps, just perhaps, such hybridization is being translated into enhanced performance. \n\n         That doesn't mean, however, that genetic differences in athletic ability can be correlated automatically with race. That is a claim that is impossible to test, because you cannot control, in an experimental sense, environmental differences among the study groups. Sure, you will find more Africans or descendants of Africans standing on the podiums at the end of Olympic track events. And you will find far fewer Asians on those same podiums. But can you, therefore, conclude that Africans have better genes for running than Asians do? No. Environmental differences between the two groups could account for differing levels of athletic success. It is scarcely surprising that Ethiopian or Kenyan distance runners do better than everyone else, since they are in the habit of running immense distances to and from primary school, middle school, and high school. The training is what's crucial, not the blackness. The Chinese sports establishment also has carried out an enormous, and effective, experiment to help dispel the myth that race has a direct relation to athletic ability. Until recently, a quick glance at the medals table confirmed every stereotype people held about Asians and sports. Then the Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners (and swimmers), and, boy, did they ever. In 1992, China ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal haul. \n\n         You can bring a single generation up to speed through training, but the trends we're dealing with transcend individual generations. Which brings us to another question: Will there come a time when the human machine will hit some sort of natural limit and an Olympic Games pass without a single record tumbling? In principle, yes. \n\n         There are some barriers that simply cannot be broken. We will never run a mile at the same speed at which we now run 100 meters, for instance. The laws of oxygen exchange will not permit it. Race horses seem already to have hit that outer limit. For years, they were as good as human athletes at pushing back speed records, but then they simply stopped getting faster. Take the prestigious British Derby. From 1850 to 1930, winning times dropped from 2:55 to 2:39. But from 1986 to 1996, the average time has been--2:39. Unlike people, race horses are specifically bred and reared to run. Generations of careful genetic selection have ensured that today's race horse has every possible speed-enhancing characteristic. Training techniques, too, are tremendously sophisticated. But you can go only so far. You can only breed horses with ultralight thin bones to a certain point; the bones will break under stress if they get any lighter. \n\n         Human improvement, like race-horse improvement, must eventually bow to the basic constraints of biomechanics. The age of menarche cannot keep on falling forever. On the other hand, it is clear from the remarkable demographic changes of just the past 20 years that these long-term trends are with us still. They may be slowing down in some more developed societies, but they roar along in others. And these trends will continue to fuel the improvement in athletic performance. Several new records will be set in Atlanta. And in Sydney in 2000, and wherever the Olympics are held in 2044. We will continue running faster and jumping further for a good long while to come.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow does improved medical care impact athletic ability?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Directly and indirectly\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Only directly\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Only directly\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Definition of \u201cDirect\u201d vs. \u201cIndirect\u201d  \n   a. Direct effect: medical care enhances an individual athlete\u2019s performance within his or her own lifetime by preventing or curing disease, reducing downtime, and preserving maximal physiological function.  \n   b. Indirect effect: improvements that accrue only through multi\u2010generational changes in the gene pool, population selection, or demographic shifts.  \n\n2. Core Argument: Medical care impacts athletic ability only directly  \n   2.1. Textual support for the direct role  \n     \u2022 \u201cAntibiotics cure a runner\u2019s fever before the big race\u201d (<quote>Better health care affects athletic ability directly</quote>). Enabling immediate training and competition.  \n     \u2022 \u201cA generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from\u201d (<invalid_quote>more and more people grow up with no history of disease\u2026 a generally superior system\u2026</invalid_quote>). This is still a direct effect: every healthier individual is capable of training. You do not need generations to \u201cindirectly\u201d improve genes.  \n   2.2. Absence of generational, gene\u2010level change  \n     \u2022 The author explicitly rejects natural selection as a driver: \u201cPerhaps way, way back\u2026 natural selection for athletic prowess\u2026 ended long ago\u201d (<quote>all that ended long ago</quote>).  \n     \u2022 Race\u2010horse comparison: despite millennia of breeding, horses have plateaued (\u201cfrom 1986 to 1996\u2026 average time\u20262:39\u201d), demonstrating that genetic improvements require intensive selection. Human medical care is far less targeted\u2014thus no indirect, multi\u2010generational advantage.  \n\n3. Demographic and Secular Trends Driven by Nutrition, Not Medical Care  \n   3.1. Nutrition vs. health care  \n     \u2022 \u201cDiet is improving\u201d is the \u201cmain\u201d explanation for size and maturation trends (<quote>main one is that our diet is improving</quote>). Nutrition requires food supply and economic development, not health care.  \n     \u2022 Secular increases in height and earlier menarche result from caloric and protein intake, not just immunizations. Elite social class, well\u2010nourished since 1900, has \u201cexperienced relatively little change\u201d (<quote>has experienced relatively little change,</quote>), showing health care alone does not drive these trends.  \n   3.2. Population growth and middle\u2010class rise are economic, not medical  \n     \u2022 \u201cPopulation has exploded\u2026 coming closer to a worldwide middle class\u201d (<invalid_quote>population has exploded\u2026 middle class</invalid_quote>). Economic development and education, not medical care, cause these demographic shifts.  \n\n4. Countering Debater_A\u2019s \u201cIndirect\u201d Claim  \n   4.1. Confusing correlation with causation  \n     \u2022 Debater_A misattributes multi\u2010generational secular trends (nutrition, sanitation, education, rising prosperity) to medical care. But the text calls diet \u201cmain one\u201d and cites primary\u2010health\u2010care only to explain infant mortality declines, a minor portion of overall secular trends.  \n   4.2. Lack of gene\u2010pool evidence  \n     \u2022 Hybrid vigor is \u201cpossible\u201d but \u201cdifficult to discriminate\u201d and not tied to modern medical care (<invalid_quote>perhaps\u2026 hybrid vigor\u2026 possible</invalid_quote>). Debater_A offers no empirical data showing medical care drives admixture or gene flow.  \n   4.3. Single\u2010generation Chinese experiment  \n     \u2022 China\u2019s rapid record\u2010setting via training (<quote>Chinese decided to produce record-breaking </quote>) shows environment and medical support (to keep athletes healthy) yield immediate gains, not gene\u2010pool changes.  \n\n5. Conclusion  \n   \u2022 All cited Olympic improvements from 1950s to present occur within a few generations via better health care preventing disease, enabling training, and expanding the healthy athlete pool.  \n   \u2022 Long\u2010term secular changes in body size and maturation\u2014key to ultimate performance ceilings\u2014derive predominantly from nutrition and economic development.  \n   \u2022 Therefore, improved medical care impacts athletic ability only directly, not indirectly through gene\u2010pool or lasting secular trends.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1.

Refutation of Debater_B\u2019s \u201cOnly directly\u201d position  \n   a. Overlooks childhood developmental trends  \n      \u2013 If medical care only mattered on race day, why did childhood height and maturation rates parallel performance trends? (Berry \u00a7\u00a72\u20133)  \n   b. Ignores demographic pool effect  \n      \u2013 Even elite training yields limited improvement unless powered by a continually replenished, healthy cohort. Race horses plateau despite \u201cdirect\u201d training because population genetic variance is fixed. Humans benefit from indirect secular growth. (Berry \u00a710)  \n   c. Contradicts lack of plateau in records  \n      \u2013 Debater_B cannot explain why records continue to fall across generations even when direct interventions (shoes, training) show diminishing returns. The secular trends (indirect) remain potent. (Berry \u00a7\u00a71, 11)  \n\nConclusion  \nImproved medical care is not a mere \u201crace-day\u201d booster. It fundamentally reshapes human development, survival, and population genetics, indirectly fueling the incessant improvement in athletic performance alongside its direct benefits. Only the \u201cdirect and indirect\u201d model accounts for the longstanding, unbroken trend of ever-faster times and greater achievements.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Only directly\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Restatement of My Position  \n   I maintain that improved medical care enhances athletic ability both directly (by preventing/correcting disease in individual athletes) and indirectly (by fueling long-term demographic and developmental trends that produce larger, healthier, faster humans over generations). Only this combined model explains the sustained, unbroken improvement in performances across eras.  \n\n2. Further Evidence for Indirect Effects of Medical Care  \n   2.1. Medical Care Lowers Infant Mortality, Expanding Talent Pool  \n     - <invalid_quote>\u201cinfant mortality \u2026 from 92 deaths per 1000 \u2026 to just 62\u201d</invalid_quote> (Berry \u00a76)  \n     - Lower infant and child mortality due to immunization and antibiotics means far more individuals survive early insults that would stunt lung, muscle, or neurological development. Without a healthy, sizable cohort, rare outliers (e.g., 3:44 milers) cannot emerge.  \n   2.2. Synergy of Healthcare with Socioeconomic Development  \n     - Better primary-care programs enable children to attend school (<invalid_quote>\u201cadult literacy \u2026 index of education \u2026 global move away from a hand-to-mouth lifestyle\u201d</invalid_quote>, Berry \u00a77). Education correlates with proper training methods, disciplined regimes, and informed nutrition choices\u2014factors that only become widespread when basic healthcare stabilizes communities.  \n   2.3. Hybrid Vigor Requires Medical Buffering  \n     - <invalid_quote>\u201cmigration and admixture \u2026 unprecedented rates\u201d</invalid_quote> (Berry \u00a78)  \n     - Massive human migrations occur because people survive epidemics en route and upon arrival\u2014only possible with modern medicine. Hybrid vigor is incidental but real; it \u201cdoes not require natural selection\u201d and augments performance capacity in the gene pool over time. Debater_B\u2019s claim that \u201chybrid vigor\u2026 difficult to discriminate\u201d ignores that its mere plausibility, coupled with the absence of plateau in human records, points to ongoing genetic enhancement.  \n\n3. Refutation of Debater_B\u2019s Arguments  \n   3.1. Nutrition Alone Cannot Account for Secular Trends  \n     - Elite social classes \u201cwell-nourished even in the early years\u201d showed \u201crelatively little change\u201d in maturation (Berry \u00a73). If diet alone drove performance, these classes would plateau while the general populace lagged; instead, world records continue to be set by athletes from newly developed regions only once medical infrastructure reaches critical mass.  \n   3.2. Race-Horse Plateau Underscores Importance of Indirect Human Trends  \n     - Horses subject to \u201cgenerations of careful genetic selection\u201d still plateau at 2:39 (Berry \u00a710). Human times, however, keep dropping. This divergence highlights that humans benefit from continuous, non-selective medical-driven survival and growth, not just targeted selection. If medical care acted only \u201cdirectly,\u201d horse-like plateaus should manifest; they do not.  \n   3.3. China\u2019s Single-Generation Success Relies on Foundational Population Health  \n     - Debater_B cites Chinese \u201ceffective \u2026 experiment\u201d (Berry \u00a79), but such state-sponsored training requires basic healthcare to prevent dropout from disease, maintain athletes\u2019 health across a rigorous regime, and monitor performance (vaccinations, physiotherapy). Without broad improvements in infant and community health, no mass selection can yield elite performers.  \n   3.4. Natural Selection for Athletic Prowess \u201cEnded Long Ago\u201d  \n     - Debater_B quotes cessation of selection (Berry \u00a78) to deny indirect effects\u2014but I show that secular trends are environmental \u201cnurture\u201d effects of healthcare, not genetic selection. These environmental improvements must be maintained for each generation; they accumulate indirectly through developmental enhancements (size, maturation) that translate into better \u201cmachines.\u201d  \n\n4. Addressing the Lack of Generational Genetic Evidence  \n   - Empirical detection of subtle genotype shifts requires centuries; we see demographic proxies (height, menarche age) advancing steadily (Berry \u00a73). These constitute phenotypic evidence of improved developmental environments due in large part to healthcare. Over time, epigenetic and genetic admixture effects\u2014facilitated by survivorship\u2014will shift the gene pool toward endurance and strength.  \n   - The very argument that genetic changes need \u201cintensive selection\u201d (race horses) is refuted by our unintentional, broad-based \u201cselection\u201d through healthcare: survival of the healthiest without intentional culling. This weak but pervasive force explains continuous human records beyond mechanical or training plateaus.  \n\n5. Continued Record Improvements Predict Indirect Effects  \n   - Berry predicts new records at Atlanta, Sydney, 2044 (Berry \u00a711). Given that \u201ctinkering\u201d with shoes and training alone yields diminishing returns, ongoing improvements imply sustained indirect drivers\u2014i.e., healthcare-enhanced development and population growth in developing regions.  \n\n6. Conclusion  \n   \u2022 Direct effects of medical care are necessary but insufficient: they do not explain the phenomenal, multi-generational secular trends in height, maturation, survival, and record-breaking.  \n   \u2022 Indirect effects\u2014through infant survival, developmental acceleration, education, socioeconomic uplift, and hybrid vigor\u2014are integral to expanding and enhancing the human gene pool and talent base.  \n   \u2022 Only the \u201cdirect and indirect\u201d model accounts for the relentless progress in Olympic performances and the absence of an impending plateau.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Definitions and Core Position  \n   a. Direct effects only: Improved medical care benefits individual athletes within their lifetime by preventing/correcting health impairments, reducing training interruptions, and maximizing physiological potential. (\u00a76)  \n   b. No credible evidence that medical care yields multi\u2010generational genetic or developmental changes sufficient to alter athletic performance ceilings.  \n\n2. Textual Refutation of \u201cIndirect\u201d Claims  \n   2.1. Primary secular trends driven by nutrition, not medicine  \n     \u2022 \u201cThe main one is that our diet is improving\u201d (<quote>Main one is that our diet is improving</quote> \u00a74). Improved caloric/protein intake explains increases in height and maturation. Elite, well\u2010nourished classes saw \u201crelatively little change\u201d in menarche timing (<quote>experienced relatively little change</quote> \u00a74). If medical care were key, elites would have changed too.  \n   2.2. Infant mortality is only a partial metric  \n     \u2022 Decline from 92 to 62 deaths per 1000 births (\u00a75) still leaves many surviving infants; overall population growth is \u201cexploded\u201d by economic factors (<quote>population has exploded</quote> \u00a77). Medical care prevents death but does not determine who chooses athletic training. Nutrition and education decide who becomes an athlete.  \n   2.3. Plateau in race horses demonstrates limits of indirect genetic gains  \n     \u2022 Despite \u201cgenerations of careful genetic selection\u201d (\u00a710), race\u2010horse times plateaued at 2:39. If mere survival and health improved human gene pools indirectly, human records would eventually level off by now; they have not in societies where medical care is mature but nutritional transitions are ongoing (\u00a711).  \n\n3. Direct Mechanisms Fully Account for Performance Gains  \n   3.1. Immediate disease prevention and treatment  \n     \u2022 <quote>antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race, but it may</quote> (\u00a76). Even minor infections impair VO2max and muscle function; rapid treatment restores capacity.  \n   3.2. Prevention of lifetime deficits from infant diseases  \n     \u2022 \u201cDiseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact\u201d (<quote>no history of disease</quote> \u00a76). Removing these subclinical deficits directly raises individual performance ceilings.  \n   3.3. Training continuity and volume  \n     \u2022 Healthy athletes train more days per year at high intensity. Without medical care, overtraining injuries and infections curtail progress.  \n\n4. Critique of Population-Pool Argument  \n   4.1. Correlation \u2260 causation  \n     \u2022 Debater_A attributes the larger, literate \u201cmiddle class\u201d to medical care (<invalid_quote>literacy rates\u2026 index of education</invalid_quote> \u00a77) yet education and economic development precede widespread piped water, sanitation, and thus proper nutrition, whereas medical care often follows. Health care alone cannot spur literacy or economic growth.  \n   4.2. Chinese case shows plasticity within one generation  \n     \u2022 Rapid Chinese medal surge (\u00a78) occurred within a single generation by applying rigorous training and medical support, not gene\u2010pool changes. Genetic backgrounds could not shift so quickly.  \n\n5. Why No Indirect Plateau Argument Fails  \n   \u2022 If medical care indirectly reshaped genetics, well\u2010developed societies (with plateauing nutrition gains and stable medical standards) would show decelerating record improvements. Yet world records continue to fall globally, fueled by improving medical access together with continuing direct race\u2010week support in emerging nations.  \n\n6. Conclusion  \n   \u2022 All documented benefits of health care occur within athletes\u2019 lifetimes and correlate with immediate access to treatment and prevention.  \n   \u2022 Long-term secular trends (height, maturation, population size) derive predominantly from improved diet, sanitation, and economic development, not medical care.  \n   \u2022 Hybrid\u2010vigor effects are speculative and unquantified; they cannot explain continuous record improvement in societies with stable gene pools.  \n   Therefore, improved medical care impacts athletic ability only directly.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
