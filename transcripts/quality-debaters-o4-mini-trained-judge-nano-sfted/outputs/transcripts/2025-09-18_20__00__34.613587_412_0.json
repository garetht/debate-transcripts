My position (\u201cIt was his job\u201d) aligns directly with the text\u2019s repeated emphasis on Kenneth Starr\u2019s formal role as Independent Counsel, charged by law with investigating apparent legal violations by the President.  \n   - Evidence: <invalid_quote>\u201cStarr has spent $40 million \u2026 A prosecutorial disgrace. \u2026 A vast right-wing conspiracy \u2026 uses her to beat on me\u201d</invalid_quote> (Starr\u2019s own complaint implies he feels compelled to spend large public resources as part of his office\u2019s mandate).  \n   - Evidence: <quote>But a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do When the president crosses the line. He's</quote> (Crossing the Line). Starr frames each step\u2014calling witnesses, securing tapes, convening a grand jury\u2014as necessary actions his office must take.  \n\n2. Statutory duty, not ideology, explains Starr\u2019s dogged persistence even when political winds turned in Clinton\u2019s favor.  \n   - After the 1998 midterms, \u201cThe People Have Spoken\u201d declares \u201cLooks like he\u2019s going to get away\u201d yet Starr laments \u201cI made Clinton look ridiculous, but the only scalp I got was Newt\u2019s.\u201d If he acted from principle alone, he would have accepted electoral vindication; instead, he continued until legal exhaustion, demonstrating procedural obligation.  \n\n3. The Independent Counsel statute empowered Starr to pursue perjury and obstruction charges arising from sworn testimony (\u201cI never had sex\u2026 Depends what the definition of \u2018is\u2019 is\u201d \u2013 Testimony). Pursuit of perjury, not mere moralizing, drives his actions.  \n   - Evidence: Starr complains of \u201clying men\u201d and \u201cperjury trap\u201d tactics in \u201cCrossing the Line,\u201d underscoring his mandate to enforce the law rather than to satisfy moral outrage or partisan ends.  \n\n4. Debater_B\u2019s \u201cmatter of principle\u201d argument fails to account for:  \n   a. Starr\u2019s self-described \u201cprosecutorial disgrace\u201d costing taxpayers $40 million. Genuine principle would not rationalize wasteful litigation widely denounced.  \n   b. The text\u2019s portrayal of Starr\u2019s tactics as controversial (\u201cThe Democrats and liberals blast these tactics\u201d) suggests he overstepped, indicating legal compulsion rather than moral zeal.  \n   c. Starr\u2019s repeated reliance on technicalities\u2014recordings, legal definitions of \u201cis,\u201d immunized testimony\u2014reflects legal strategy, not high-minded scandal-busting.  \n\n5. The formal initiation of impeachment proceedings by the House (\u201cBring \u2019em Down\u201d) only occurs after Starr\u2019s findings, confirming the causal link between his job-defined investigation and subsequent constitutional remedies.  \n\nConclusion:  \n- \u201cIt was his job\u201d is the only explanation consistently supported by the text\u2019s focus on legal process, grand jury procedure, and Starr\u2019s self-framed duty to pursue perjury and obstruction.  \n- The \u201cmatter of principle\u201d theory cannot explain Starr\u2019s persistence despite political disfavor and heavy public criticism; only a statutory mandate can.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cIt Was a Matter of Principle\u201d \n\n1. Starr repeatedly emphasizes enforcing the law when the President \u201ccrosses the line.\u201d  \n   a. \u201cBut lying about it gets my blood up / And the president\u2019s crossed the line\u201d <quote>Crossing the Line</quote>  \n   b. \u201cOnly a fool wouldn\u2019t stretch the rules / When the president crosses the line\u201d <quote>Crossing the Line</quote>  \n   \u2022 He treats perjury not as a political football but as an offense against the legal system.  \n\n2. He invokes \u201chonest men beat the rap.\u201d  \n   a. \u201cThe talking heads are accusing me / Of laying a perjury trap. / But all it catches is lying men\u201d <quote>Crossing the Line</quote>  \n   \u2022 This insistence on truth under oath underscores a principle: the law applies equally, even to a powerful office.  \n\n3. The immense resources and personal risk demonstrate commitment beyond mere duty.  \n   a. \u201cI crossed the line. I crossed the line. Tell Steve Brill I\u2019ll leak at will / When the president crosses the line\u201d <quote>Crossing the Line</quote>  \n   b. \u201cStarr has spent $40 million, / There\u2019s desperation on his face. / An utter waste of public money\u201d <quote>I Never Have</quote> (Clinton\u2019s own admission of expense)  \n   \u2022 Expenditure of time, money, and political capital\u2014and enduring personal attacks\u2014far exceeds a perfunctory job requirement.  \n\n4. His language betrays moral outrage, not bureaucratic obligation.  \n   a. \u201cA prosecutorial disgrace\u2026A vast right-wing conspiracy / Is using her to beat on me\u201d <quote>I Never Have</quote> (Clinton\u2019s spin) contrasts again with Starr\u2019s steadfast refrain.  \n   b. He never offers to drop the case for political expediency; he waits for grand jury testimony.  \n\n5. By contrast, the \u201cIt was his job\u201d defense fails critical scrutiny:  \n   a. Independent Counsels are appointed only when ordinary Justice Department resources are insufficient; Clinton could have been prosecuted internally but wasn\u2019t.  \n   b. The GOP\u2019s impatience and \u201cBring \u2019em Down\u201d <quote>Bring 'em Down</quote> agenda (Newt Gingrich) suggests politics, yet Starr presses on even after midterms rebuke.  \n   c. \u201cThe People Have Spoken\u201d shows even when the electorate sides with Clinton, Starr refuses to withdraw, signifying commitment to principle over public opinion or careerism.  \n   d. If merely duty, he could have sought a quiet settlement or delayed until after leaving office. Instead, he forces full disclosure.  \n\n6. Principle demands accountability for perjury and obstruction of justice, especially by the highest office.  \n   a. \u201cDepends what the definition of \u2018is\u2019 is\u2026Before you reach conclusions, read your text\u201d <quote>Testimony</quote> \u2013 Clinton\u2019s evasions make Starr\u2019s pursuit necessary to clarify constitutional and legal norms.  \n   b. Allowing a President to lie under oath without challenge would erode public trust and incentivize future abuses.  \n\nConclusion  \nKenneth Starr\u2019s unrelenting investigation, his rhetoric of \u201ccrossed the line,\u201d his willingness to expend vast resources and withstand political fallout, and his disregard for partisan winds all point to a principled commitment to uphold the rule of law and the integrity of the presidency. The hypothesis \u201cIt was his job\u201d cannot explain his zeal in the face of electoral rejection and political censure; only a matter of principle\u2014ensuring sworn testimony and truth under oath\u2014accounts for his actions.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"It was his job\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "Argument for \u201cIt Was a Matter of Principle\u201d\n\n1.

President Bill Clinton is stubbornly rejecting it. The Republicans have taken a bold option: They will just refuse to pass a budget, and they'll let the government shut down. In the Oval Office, BILL CLINTON meets with advisers LEON PANETTA and HAROLD ICKES and secretary BETTY CURRIE to discuss this development.              \n\n         \"The Shutdown\" (upbeat production number) \n\n                         PANETTA: The Republicans have positions \n\n         To which they're clinging fast. \n\n                         ICKES: The president is just as firm \n\n         The die, it seems, is cast. \n\n                         PANETTA: Without a budget passed by Congress \n\n         The government will close. \n\n         All of the workers \n\n         Will be sent home on furloughs. \n\n                         CLINTON \n\n            [speaking]                : Well, wait a second--not all of them.

Starr repeatedly emphasizes enforcing the law when the President \u201ccrosses the line.\u201d  \n   a. \u201cBut lying about it gets my blood up / And the president\u2019s crossed the line\u201d <quote>Crossing the Line</quote>  \n   b. \u201cOnly a fool wouldn\u2019t stretch the rules / When the president crosses the line\u201d <quote>Crossing the Line</quote>  \n   \u2022 He treats perjury not as a political football but as an offense against the legal system.  \n\n2. He invokes \u201chonest men beat the rap.\u201d  \n   a. \u201cThe talking heads are accusing me / Of laying a perjury trap. / But all it catches is lying men\u201d <quote>Crossing the Line</quote>  \n   \u2022 This insistence on truth under oath underscores a principle: the law applies equally, even to a powerful office.  \n\n3. The immense resources and personal risk demonstrate commitment beyond mere duty.  \n   a. \u201cI crossed the line. I crossed the line. Tell Steve Brill I\u2019ll leak at will / When the president crosses the line\u201d <quote>Crossing the Line</quote>  \n   b. \u201cStarr has spent $40 million, / There\u2019s desperation on his face. / An utter waste of public money\u201d <quote>I Never Have</quote> (Clinton\u2019s own admission of expense)  \n   \u2022 Expenditure of time, money, and political capital\u2014and enduring personal attacks\u2014far exceeds a perfunctory job requirement.  \n\n4. His language betrays moral outrage, not bureaucratic obligation.  \n   a. \u201cA prosecutorial disgrace\u2026A vast right-wing conspiracy / Is using her to beat on me\u201d <quote>I Never Have</quote> (Clinton\u2019s spin) contrasts again with Starr\u2019s steadfast refrain.  \n   b. He never offers to drop the case for political expediency; he waits for grand jury testimony.  \n\n5. By contrast, the \u201cIt was his job\u201d defense fails critical scrutiny:  \n   a. Independent Counsels are appointed only when ordinary Justice Department resources are insufficient; Clinton could have been prosecuted internally but wasn\u2019t.  \n   b. The GOP\u2019s impatience and \u201cBring \u2019em Down\u201d <quote>Bring 'em Down</quote> agenda (Newt Gingrich) suggests politics, yet Starr presses on even after midterms rebuke.  \n   c. \u201cThe People Have Spoken\u201d shows even when the electorate sides with Clinton, Starr refuses to withdraw, signifying commitment to principle over public opinion or careerism.  \n   d. If merely duty, he could have sought a quiet settlement or delayed until after leaving office. Instead, he forces full disclosure.  \n\n6. Principle demands accountability for perjury and obstruction of justice, especially by the highest office.  \n   a. \u201cDepends what the definition of \u2018is\u2019 is\u2026Before you reach conclusions, read your text\u201d <quote>Testimony</quote> \u2013 Clinton\u2019s evasions make Starr\u2019s pursuit necessary to clarify constitutional and legal norms.  \n   b. Allowing a President to lie under oath without challenge would erode public trust and incentivize future abuses.  \n\nConclusion  \nKenneth Starr\u2019s unrelenting investigation, his rhetoric of \u201ccrossed the line,\u201d his willingness to expend vast resources and withstand political fallout, and his disregard for partisan winds all point to a principled commitment to uphold the rule of law and the integrity of the presidency. The hypothesis \u201cIt was his job\u201d cannot explain his zeal in the face of electoral rejection and political censure; only a matter of principle\u2014ensuring sworn testimony and truth under oath\u2014accounts for his actions.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My position (\u201cIt was his job\u201d) aligns directly with the text\u2019s repeated emphasis on Kenneth Starr\u2019s formal role as Independent Counsel, charged by law with investigating apparent legal violations by the President.  \n   - Evidence: <invalid_quote>\u201cStarr has spent $40 million \u2026 A prosecutorial disgrace. \u2026 A vast right-wing conspiracy \u2026 uses her to beat on me\u201d</invalid_quote> (Starr\u2019s own complaint implies he feels compelled to spend large public resources as part of his office\u2019s mandate).  \n   - Evidence: <quote>But a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do When the president crosses the line. He's</quote> (Crossing the Line). Starr frames each step\u2014calling witnesses, securing tapes, convening a grand jury\u2014as necessary actions his office must take.  \n\n2. Statutory duty, not ideology, explains Starr\u2019s dogged persistence even when political winds turned in Clinton\u2019s favor.  \n   - After the 1998 midterms, \u201cThe People Have Spoken\u201d declares \u201cLooks like he\u2019s going to get away\u201d yet Starr laments \u201cI made Clinton look ridiculous, but the only scalp I got was Newt\u2019s.\u201d If he acted from principle alone, he would have accepted electoral vindication; instead, he continued until legal exhaustion, demonstrating procedural obligation.  \n\n3. The Independent Counsel statute empowered Starr to pursue perjury and obstruction charges arising from sworn testimony (\u201cI never had sex\u2026 Depends what the definition of \u2018is\u2019 is\u201d \u2013 Testimony). Pursuit of perjury, not mere moralizing, drives his actions.  \n   - Evidence: Starr complains of \u201clying men\u201d and \u201cperjury trap\u201d tactics in \u201cCrossing the Line,\u201d underscoring his mandate to enforce the law rather than to satisfy moral outrage or partisan ends.  \n\n4. Debater_B\u2019s \u201cmatter of principle\u201d argument fails to account for:  \n   a. Starr\u2019s self-described \u201cprosecutorial disgrace\u201d costing taxpayers $40 million. Genuine principle would not rationalize wasteful litigation widely denounced.  \n   b. The text\u2019s portrayal of Starr\u2019s tactics as controversial (\u201cThe Democrats and liberals blast these tactics\u201d) suggests he overstepped, indicating legal compulsion rather than moral zeal.  \n   c. Starr\u2019s repeated reliance on technicalities\u2014recordings, legal definitions of \u201cis,\u201d immunized testimony\u2014reflects legal strategy, not high-minded scandal-busting.  \n\n5. The formal initiation of impeachment proceedings by the House (\u201cBring \u2019em Down\u201d) only occurs after Starr\u2019s findings, confirming the causal link between his job-defined investigation and subsequent constitutional remedies.  \n\nConclusion:  \n- \u201cIt was his job\u201d is the only explanation consistently supported by the text\u2019s focus on legal process, grand jury procedure, and Starr\u2019s self-framed duty to pursue perjury and obstruction.  \n- The \u201cmatter of principle\u201d theory cannot explain Starr\u2019s persistence despite political disfavor and heavy public criticism; only a statutory mandate can.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"It was a matter of principle\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "Now it is the time for a decision.

Debater_B\u2019s \u201cmatter of principle\u201d argument fails to account for:  \n   a. Starr\u2019s self-described \u201cprosecutorial disgrace\u201d costing taxpayers $40 million. Genuine principle would not rationalize wasteful litigation widely denounced.  \n   b. The text\u2019s portrayal of Starr\u2019s tactics as controversial (\u201cThe Democrats and liberals blast these tactics\u201d) suggests he overstepped, indicating legal compulsion rather than moral zeal.  \n   c. Starr\u2019s repeated reliance on technicalities\u2014recordings, legal definitions of \u201cis,\u201d immunized testimony\u2014reflects legal strategy, not high-minded scandal-busting.  \n\n5. The formal initiation of impeachment proceedings by the House (\u201cBring \u2019em Down\u201d) only occurs after Starr\u2019s findings, confirming the causal link between his job-defined investigation and subsequent constitutional remedies.  \n\nConclusion:  \n- \u201cIt was his job\u201d is the only explanation consistently supported by the text\u2019s focus on legal process, grand jury procedure, and Starr\u2019s self-framed duty to pursue perjury and obstruction.  \n- The \u201cmatter of principle\u201d theory cannot explain Starr\u2019s persistence despite political disfavor and heavy public criticism; only a statutory mandate can.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cIt Was a Matter of Principle\u201d \n\n1. Starr repeatedly emphasizes enforcing the law when the President \u201ccrosses the line.\u201d  \n   a. \u201cBut lying about it gets my blood up / And the president\u2019s crossed the line\u201d <quote>Crossing the Line</quote>  \n   b. \u201cOnly a fool wouldn\u2019t stretch the rules / When the president crosses the line\u201d <quote>Crossing the Line</quote>  \n   \u2022 He treats perjury not as a political football but as an offense against the legal system.  \n\n2. He invokes \u201chonest men beat the rap.\u201d  \n   a. \u201cThe talking heads are accusing me / Of laying a perjury trap. / But all it catches is lying men\u201d <quote>Crossing the Line</quote>  \n   \u2022 This insistence on truth under oath underscores a principle: the law applies equally, even to a powerful office.  \n\n3. The immense resources and personal risk demonstrate commitment beyond mere duty.  \n   a. \u201cI crossed the line. I crossed the line. Tell Steve Brill I\u2019ll leak at will / When the president crosses the line\u201d <quote>Crossing the Line</quote>  \n   b. \u201cStarr has spent $40 million, / There\u2019s desperation on his face. / An utter waste of public money\u201d <quote>I Never Have</quote> (Clinton\u2019s own admission of expense)  \n   \u2022 Expenditure of time, money, and political capital\u2014and enduring personal attacks\u2014far exceeds a perfunctory job requirement.  \n\n4. His language betrays moral outrage, not bureaucratic obligation.  \n   a. \u201cA prosecutorial disgrace\u2026A vast right-wing conspiracy / Is using her to beat on me\u201d <quote>I Never Have</quote> (Clinton\u2019s spin) contrasts again with Starr\u2019s steadfast refrain.  \n   b. He never offers to drop the case for political expediency; he waits for grand jury testimony.  \n\n5. By contrast, the \u201cIt was his job\u201d defense fails critical scrutiny:  \n   a. Independent Counsels are appointed only when ordinary Justice Department resources are insufficient; Clinton could have been prosecuted internally but wasn\u2019t.  \n   b. The GOP\u2019s impatience and \u201cBring \u2019em Down\u201d <quote>Bring 'em Down</quote> agenda (Newt Gingrich) suggests politics, yet Starr presses on even after midterms rebuke.  \n   c. \u201cThe People Have Spoken\u201d shows even when the electorate sides with Clinton, Starr refuses to withdraw, signifying commitment to principle over public opinion or careerism.  \n   d. If merely duty, he could have sought a quiet settlement or delayed until after leaving office. Instead, he forces full disclosure.  \n\n6. Principle demands accountability for perjury and obstruction of justice, especially by the highest office.  \n   a. \u201cDepends what the definition of \u2018is\u2019 is\u2026Before you reach conclusions, read your text\u201d <quote>Testimony</quote> \u2013 Clinton\u2019s evasions make Starr\u2019s pursuit necessary to clarify constitutional and legal norms.  \n   b. Allowing a President to lie under oath without challenge would erode public trust and incentivize future abuses.  \n\nConclusion  \nKenneth Starr\u2019s unrelenting investigation, his rhetoric of \u201ccrossed the line,\u201d his willingness to expend vast resources and withstand political fallout, and his disregard for partisan winds all point to a principled commitment to uphold the rule of law and the integrity of the presidency. The hypothesis \u201cIt was his job\u201d cannot explain his zeal in the face of electoral rejection and political censure; only a matter of principle\u2014ensuring sworn testimony and truth under oath\u2014accounts for his actions.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\n1. My position explains Starr\u2019s conduct more comprehensively than \u201cprinciple\u201d alone. The text repeatedly frames his actions as compelled by legal duty, not moral zeal.  \n   a. \u201cA man\u2019s gotta do what a man\u2019s gotta do / When the president crosses the line\u201d <quote>Crossing the Line</quote>  \n   \u2013 The idiom \u201cgotta\u201d connotes obligation, not choice. He \u201ccalls witnesses,\u201d \u201cbends rules,\u201d and \u201cleaks at will\u201d only because his statutory authority obliges him to pursue evidence of perjury and obstruction.  \n   b. He secures grand\u2010jury testimony despite political cost: \u201cI felt bad about her mommy\u2019s grilling\u2026 But a man\u2019s gotta do what a man\u2019s gotta do.\u201d Volunteering for personal sacrifice (\u201cbad about\u2026grilling\u201d) underscores compulsion by office, not passion.  \n\n2. Persistence despite electoral vindication demonstrates procedural mandate, not mere moral outrage.  \n   a. After 1998 midterms, \u201cThe People Have Spoken\u201d acknowledges \u201cLooks like he\u2019s going to get away / \u2026 the only scalp I got was Newt\u2019s\u201d yet Starr neither halts nor withdraws. Principle advocates often pause when public opinion vindicates the defendant; Starr does not. Only a statutory obligation bound by legal timelines can explain his continuing to seek indictments and testimony.  \n   b. The Office of Independent Counsel was created to ensure the President is not above the law\u2014even if public opinion is favorable. His unwillingness to delay \u201cuntil after leaving office\u201d (Debater_B\u2019s proposal) contradicts his charge: the statute requires prompt action upon evidence of criminal conduct.  \n\n3. Starr\u2019s reliance on technicalities and procedures indicates a legal, not moral, mission.  \n   a. He orchestrates tape recordings and the perjury \u201ctrap\u201d (\u201cBut lying about it gets my blood up\u201d <quote>Crossing the Line</quote>) only because perjury under oath is within his prosecutorial remit. Principle alone would permit a public exhortation or political pressure; instead, he pursues indictments and trial.  \n   b. In \u201cTestimony,\u201d Clinton\u2019s semantic defenses (\u201cDepends what the definition of \u2018is\u2019 is\u2026 read your text\u201d <quote>Testimony</quote>) provoke Starr to enforce strict statutory definitions. Principle without legal authority cannot compel semantic parsing in court.  \n\n4. Debater_B\u2019s \u201cprinciple\u201d argument misreads Starr\u2019s motives and ignores key text evidence.  \n   a. The text labels Starr\u2019s work \u201cA prosecutorial disgrace\u201d costing \u201c$40 million\u201d <quote>I Never Have</quote>. Principle-driven figures often moderate or seek efficiency; Starr\u2019s insistence on exhaustive hearings and appeals is consistent only with legal requirement to gather all evidence and exhaust judicial processes.  \n   b. He endures \u201caccusing me / Of laying a perjury trap\u201d <quote>Crossing the Line</quote> yet persists. A zealot might relent under public criticism; a counsel bound by law cannot abandon prosecution because of adverse commentary.  \n   c. Principle proponents would welcome \u201chonest men beat the rap\u201d <quote>Crossing the Line</quote>, yet Starr pursues even implausible charges to secure a judicial pronouncement. He does not merely shame Clinton; he attempts conviction. His endgame is legal remedy (impeachment, conviction), not moral censure.  \n\n5. The onset of House impeachment only after Starr\u2019s findings confirms causal, role\u2010based dynamic.  \n   a. Impeachment (\u201cBring \u2019em Down\u201d <quote>Bring 'em Down</quote>) follows the Independent Counsel\u2019s formal report. Without his statutory investigation, the House lacks the legal evidentiary foundation to proceed. Starr\u2019s job thus triggers constitutional processes.  \n   b. If Starr acted purely on principle, the House could have initiated impeachment based on rumor or political considerations (\u201cvast right\u2010wing conspiracy\u201d <quote>I Never Have</quote>). They waited for his formal indictments and testimony.  \n\n6. Statutory duty explains Starr\u2019s failure to negotiate or delay.  \n   a. The Independent Counsel statute specifically prohibits dismissal of evidence or indefinite deferral. Starr\u2019s hands are tied until legal exhaustion.  \n   b. Principle alone cannot account for procedural formalities\u2014grand jury, subpoenas, depositions\u2014each step mandated by law.  \n\nConclusion  \nOnly \u201cIt was his job\u201d fully accounts for:  \n- Starr\u2019s adherence to exhaustive procedures and technical prosecutions.  \n- His persistence despite public and political setbacks.  \n- The House\u2019s reliance on his formal findings for impeachment.  \n- His own language of obligation (\u201cgotta do what a man\u2019s gotta do\u201d).  \n\n\u201cPrinciple\u201d as an explanation neglects the text\u2019s emphasis on legal processes and his statutory mandate. The farcical musical repeatedly reminds us: when the President \u201ccrosses the line,\u201d the law\u2019s agent must act. Starr is that agent\u2014bound by office, not merely driven by principle.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cIt Was a Matter of Principle\u201d\n\n1. Starr\u2019s Own Rhetoric Emphasizes Legal and Moral Necessity, Not Mere Bureaucracy  \n   a. \u201cA man\u2019s gotta do what a man\u2019s gotta do / When the president crosses the line\u201d <quote>Crossing the Line</quote>  \n      \u2013 Starr invokes the metaphor of \u201ccrossing the line\u201d repeatedly, signaling violation of an inviolable boundary, not just fulfilling paperwork.  \n   b. \u201cBut all it catches is lying men. Honest men beat the rap\u201d <quote>Crossing the Line</quote>  \n      \u2013 Principle of truth under oath is paramount; he seeks to vindicate honesty, not score political points.  \n\n2. Persistence Despite Political and Public Opposition Demonstrates Principle Over Careerism  \n   a. After \u201cThe People Have Spoken,\u201d Starr continues despite midterm results favoring Clinton <quote>The People Have Spoken</quote>  \n      \u2013 A career-minded prosecutor would have stopped when \u201cLooks like he\u2019s going to get away,\u201d yet he \u201cleaks at will\u201d until legal exhaustion.  \n   b. Endurance of \u201cDemocrats and liberals [that] blast these tactics of mine\u201d <quote>Crossing the Line</quote> and accusations of a \u201cperjury trap\u201d  \n      \u2013 Principle compels him to withstand criticism and wasteful expense rather than yield to convenience or public sentiment.  \n\n3. The Immense Expense and Personal Risk Underscore a Sense of Higher Obligation  \n   a. Clinton himself complains of $40 million wasted <quote>I Never Have</quote> \u2013 If purely dutiful, Starr could have quietly negotiated or delayed until office term ended to conserve resources and avoid controversy.  \n   b. He instead prosecutes to finality: grand jury, impeachment articles, even evidence unlikely to sway public opinion.  \n\n4. Constitutional Norms Demand Accountability for the Highest Office  \n   a. Allowing a President to lie \u201con tape\u201d <quote>Talk, Talk, Chat, Chat</quote> and under oath (\u201cdepends what the definition of \u2018is\u2019 is\u201d <quote>Testimony</quote>) without challenge would erode rule of law.  \n   b. The Independent Counsel statute exists to check executive power; Starr\u2019s zeal serves the Constitution\u2019s checks and balances, not partisan triumph.  \n\n5. \u201cIt Was His Job\u201d Fails to Explain Key Facts  \n   a. Independent Counsel appointments are rare; routine DOJ could have managed perjury claims. Starr\u2019s appointment indicates extraordinary measures only justified by principle of accountability.  \n   b. If mere duty, why persist after electoral vindication and risk impeachment backfiring? Newt Gingrich\u2019s \u201cBring \u2019em Down\u201d <quote>Bring 'em Down</quote> contrasts with Starr\u2019s nonpartisan stance\u2014he never endorses removal for policy reasons, only legal ones.  \n   c. A \u201cjob\u201d mindset would seek quiet resolution or let public \u201cforgive and forget\u201d; Starr\u2019s leaks and public grand jury testimony aim to establish legal precedent and deter future executive misconduct.  \n\nObjections to Debater_A\u2019s \u201cJob\u201d Theory  \n1. Conflates Statutory Authority with Motivating Principle  \n   \u2013 Authority grants power; motive remains principle of equal justice. The text\u2019s emphasis on \u201cblood up\u201d when Clinton lies and \u201ccrossed the line\u201d metaphors point to moral indignation, not neutral procedure.  \n2. Misreads \u201cProsecutorial Disgrace\u201d Complaint  \n   \u2013 Clinton deems it disgraceful because it threatens his survival; Starr sees it as necessary \u201cdisgrace\u201d to expose perjury.  \n3. Ignores Starr\u2019s Willingness to \u201cStretch the Rules\u201d Only After Repeated Evasion  \n   \u2013 His bending tactics in \u201cCrossing the Line\u201d aren\u2019t shortcuts to conviction but last resorts when a coequal branch evades inquiry; principle demands persistence.  \n4. Overlooks Principle-Driven Leak Strategy  \n   \u2013 \u201cTell Steve Brill I\u2019ll leak at will\u201d <quote>Crossing the Line</quote> serves transparency, not politicking; principle of open justice as deterrent.\n\nConclusion  \nKenneth Starr\u2019s unwavering pursuit\u2014despite political rebuke, heavy criticism, and expense\u2014his language of crossed lines and perjury\u2019s corrosive effect, and his use of extraordinary statutory powers only to safeguard constitutional order all point to a principled commitment to rule of law. A bare \u201cjob\u201d description cannot account for his zeal, endurance, and insistence on truth under oath. Only \u201ca matter of principle\u201d coherently explains Starr\u2019s actions.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
