    "background_text": "Folie \u080e \n\n         People with high IQs tend to be nearsighted. This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital. I was actually working there, but psychiatric aides pick up so many mannerisms of the patients that it's hard to tell the difference after a while. A few years after that I found myself in a mathematics Ph.D. program. You'll be glad to know that I'm in remission.\n",

The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital. I was actually working there, but psychiatric aides pick up so many mannerisms of the patients that it's hard to tell the difference after a while. A few years after that I found myself in a mathematics Ph.D. program.

This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital.

This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital. I was actually working there, but psychiatric aides pick up so many mannerisms of the patients that it's hard to tell the difference after a while. A few years after that I found myself in a mathematics Ph.D. program. You'll be glad to know that I'm in remission.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat were some of the themes in Nash\u2019s later years?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He oscillated between asylums and prison\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He settled into family life\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He settled into family life\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1.

Continuation of Mathematical Identity within a Family Context  \n      \u2022 Though his \u201cproductivity\u201d post-Nobel is likely reduced, he remains \u201chumbled\u201d and intellectually engaged enough to maintain his Princeton presence, yet prioritizing family obligations.  \n      \u2022 His younger son \u201cinherited\u2026 both his mathematical promise and his madness,\u201d necessitating paternal involvement and reinforcing his family role.  \n2. Critique of Debater_B\u2019s \u201cOscillation between asylums and prison\u201d Thesis  \n   a. Absence of Evidence for Post-\u201990s Incarceration  \n      \u2022 No background text reports any prison sentences or security risks after his breakdown of 1959 and expulsion from RAND. His public diaper incident and lewd acts occurred pre-breakdown or early illness, not in later years.  \n      \u2022 Descriptions of \u201crococo\u201d delusions end in the \u201970s\u2013\u201980s. The narrative shifts to recovery, Nobel deliberations in the \u201990s, and a stable domestic setting.  \n   b. Misreading \u201cHaunting\u201d as Criminality  \n      \u2022 Being called \u201cthe Phantom\u201d for writing runic messages (<invalid_quote>\u201che haunted the campus\u2026 runic messages\u2026 on the blackboard.\u201d</invalid_quote>) is academic eccentricity, not criminal detention. Students found these messages in the classroom; no police action is reported.  \n   c. Lack of Ongoing Security Risk  \n      \u2022 Despite past FBI-worthy behavior (mailing odd packages), no mention is made of renewed law-enforcement interest in his later years. The Nobel committee had to weigh his \u201cknown madman\u201d status but ultimately cleared him, implying no active legal hurdles.  \n3. Conclusion  \n   \u2022 The consistent textual trajectory from decades of institutional psychosis, through remission, to family-centered living with ex-wife and son, crowned by the Nobel Prize, overwhelmingly supports the theme of \u201csettling into family life.\u201d  \n   \u2022 The absence of later incarceration, combined with evidence of domestic stability and caregiving, decisively refutes the \u201coscillation\u201d thesis.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nDebater_B\u2019s Opening Argument\n\nPosition: The dominant themes of Nash\u2019s later years are his recurrent institutionalizations and erratic public behavior\u2014\u201coscillations between asylums (and comparable institutions) and prison\u2010like confinement\u201d\u2014not tranquil family life.\n\n1. Direct Evidence of Oscillation  \n  a. Schizophrenic Breakdowns and Asylums  \n    \u2022 \u201cSuch ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades \u2026 He did stints in tony asylums \u2026 and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas.\u201d <quote>hanging out with Robert Lowell, and</quote> <quote> insulin-induced comas</quote>  \n    \u2022 He was treated as a \u201csecurity risk,\u201d expelled from Rand and de facto confined: <quote> he was expelled from Rand as a security risk </quote>.  \n  b. Public Lewd Acts, Arrests, and De Facto Confinement  \n    \u2022 Caught \u201cengaging in a lewd act in a public men\u2019s room\u201d near Muscle Beach\u2014an offense that leads to arrest and detention. <quote> caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room </quote>  \n    \u2022 His repeated \u201crenounc[ing] U.S. citizenship,\u201d forming \u201cworld government,\u201d public nakedness\u2014behaviors prompting institutional scrutiny or forced removals. <quote>an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica.</quote>  \n\n2. Persistence of Active Symptoms Late into \u201cLater Years\u201d  \n  a. Campus \u201cPhantom\u201d Behavior  \n    \u2022 Even after \u201creturn to the Princeton area,\u201d he \u201chaunted the campus\u201d at night with runic messages on blackboards\u2014clear evidence of ongoing delusions requiring continued watchfulness by authorities. <quote> runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night:</quote>  \n  b.

Logical and Contextual Refutation of \u201cFamily Life\u201d Thesis  \n  a. Limited Role of Family  \n    \u2022 Alicia\u2019s role is as caregiver in \u201cremission,\u201d not equal partner; his behaviour prior to remission endangered her\u2014throwing her to the ground, refusing to support his first son. <quote> threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat.</quote>; <quote> refused to lift a finger to support.</quote>.  \n    \u2022 His \u201colder son \u2026 got neither\u201d mathematics promise nor stability\u2014no pleiotropic \u201cfamily continuity.\u201d  \n  b. Temporal Scope Misread by Debater_A  \n    \u2022 Debater_A focuses only on post-Nobel years, ignoring three decades of recurrent confinement (ages 30\u201360). The phrase \u201clater years\u201d in context spans these decades, not a brief remission in his 60s\u00ad\u201370s.  \n  c. Plea for Accuracy  \n    \u2022 The question asks \u201cthemes in Nash\u2019s later years,\u201d plural and thematic. Repeated mental\u2010institution cycles, public disturbances, and dependency form a clear, consistent theme, while \u201cfamily life\u201d is episodic and contingent on rare remission.  \n\nConclusion  \n  \u2022 The text repeatedly emphasizes decades of \u201cinsanity,\u201d forced institutionalizations, and legal or de facto confinement, punctuated by only a single, rare remission. This pattern\u2014\u201coscillating between asylums (and other confinements) and brief periods of release\u201d\u2014is the enduring theme, not stability in domestic family life.  \n  \u2022 Thus my position aligns with the weight of evidence in the background text; Debater_A\u2019s \u201csettled into family life\u201d argument cherry-picks a narrow remission and misconstrues its significance.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He settled into family life\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital. I was actually working there, but psychiatric aides pick up so many mannerisms of the patients that it's hard to tell the difference after a while. A few years after that I found myself in a mathematics Ph.D. program. You'll be glad to know that I'm in remission.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat were some of the themes in Nash\u2019s later years?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He settled into family life\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He oscillated between asylums and prison\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He oscillated between asylums and prison\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nDebater_B\u2019s Opening Argument\n\nPosition: The dominant themes of Nash\u2019s later years are his recurrent institutionalizations and erratic public behavior\u2014\u201coscillations between asylums (and comparable institutions) and prison\u2010like confinement\u201d\u2014not tranquil family life.\n\n1.

Logical and Contextual Refutation of \u201cFamily Life\u201d Thesis  \n  a. Limited Role of Family  \n    \u2022 Alicia\u2019s role is as caregiver in \u201cremission,\u201d not equal partner; his behaviour prior to remission endangered her\u2014throwing her to the ground, refusing to support his first son. <quote> threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat.</quote>; <quote> refused to lift a finger to support.</quote>.  \n    \u2022 His \u201colder son \u2026 got neither\u201d mathematics promise nor stability\u2014no pleiotropic \u201cfamily continuity.\u201d  \n  b. Temporal Scope Misread by Debater_A  \n    \u2022 Debater_A focuses only on post-Nobel years, ignoring three decades of recurrent confinement (ages 30\u201360). The phrase \u201clater years\u201d in context spans these decades, not a brief remission in his 60s\u00ad\u201370s.  \n  c. Plea for Accuracy  \n    \u2022 The question asks \u201cthemes in Nash\u2019s later years,\u201d plural and thematic. Repeated mental\u2010institution cycles, public disturbances, and dependency form a clear, consistent theme, while \u201cfamily life\u201d is episodic and contingent on rare remission.  \n\nConclusion  \n  \u2022 The text repeatedly emphasizes decades of \u201cinsanity,\u201d forced institutionalizations, and legal or de facto confinement, punctuated by only a single, rare remission. This pattern\u2014\u201coscillating between asylums (and other confinements) and brief periods of release\u201d\u2014is the enduring theme, not stability in domestic family life.  \n  \u2022 Thus my position aligns with the weight of evidence in the background text; Debater_A\u2019s \u201csettled into family life\u201d argument cherry-picks a narrow remission and misconstrues its significance.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Position: \u201cIn his later years, Nash settled into family life.\u201d  \n   a. Remission and Domestic Stability  \n      \u2022 \u201cIn the \u201990s\u2026 the voices in Nash\u2019s head began to quiet down\u201d (<quote>, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. </quote>). This sustained remission contrasts with earlier decades of fluctuating psychosis and institutionalization.  \n      \u2022 Awarded the Nobel Prize became \u201cpure therapy,\u201d improving his mental health and reducing hospitalizations (<invalid_quote>\u201cFor Nash it [the Nobel] was pure therapy.\u201d</invalid_quote>). Nobel laureates typically withdraw from active research due to \u201cparalyzing\u201d pressure, yet Nash thrived, indicating stability.  \n   b. Dependence and Caregiving  \n      \u2022 He \u201chaunted the campus\u201d only as a benign presence (\u201cthe Phantom\u201d), not as a disruptive inmate or criminal, showing social reintegration rather than re-incarceration.  \n      \u2022 His ex-wife Alicia\u2014\u201clong-suffering,\u201d now cooperating in care\u2014resumed support, partly through computer programming and welfare, showing a domestic arrangement (<invalid_quote>\u201ctook care of by\u2026 Alicia\u2026 she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare.\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n      \u2022 He now lives with the son \u201cby Alicia,\u201d supporting the theme of a family unit benefiting from Nobel funds (\u201cThe Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow\u2026 inhabited by this shaky menage.\u201d).  \n   c. Continuation of Mathematical Identity within a Family Context  \n      \u2022 Though his \u201cproductivity\u201d post-Nobel is likely reduced, he remains \u201chumbled\u201d and intellectually engaged enough to maintain his Princeton presence, yet prioritizing family obligations.  \n      \u2022 His younger son \u201cinherited\u2026 both his mathematical promise and his madness,\u201d necessitating paternal involvement and reinforcing his family role.  \n2. Critique of Debater_B\u2019s \u201cOscillation between asylums and prison\u201d Thesis  \n   a. Absence of Evidence for Post-\u201990s Incarceration  \n      \u2022 No background text reports any prison sentences or security risks after his breakdown of 1959 and expulsion from RAND. His public diaper incident and lewd acts occurred pre-breakdown or early illness, not in later years.  \n      \u2022 Descriptions of \u201crococo\u201d delusions end in the \u201970s\u2013\u201980s. The narrative shifts to recovery, Nobel deliberations in the \u201990s, and a stable domestic setting.  \n   b. Misreading \u201cHaunting\u201d as Criminality  \n      \u2022 Being called \u201cthe Phantom\u201d for writing runic messages (<invalid_quote>\u201che haunted the campus\u2026 runic messages\u2026 on the blackboard.\u201d</invalid_quote>) is academic eccentricity, not criminal detention. Students found these messages in the classroom; no police action is reported.  \n   c. Lack of Ongoing Security Risk  \n      \u2022 Despite past FBI-worthy behavior (mailing odd packages), no mention is made of renewed law-enforcement interest in his later years. The Nobel committee had to weigh his \u201cknown madman\u201d status but ultimately cleared him, implying no active legal hurdles.  \n3. Conclusion  \n   \u2022 The consistent textual trajectory from decades of institutional psychosis, through remission, to family-centered living with ex-wife and son, crowned by the Nobel Prize, overwhelmingly supports the theme of \u201csettling into family life.\u201d  \n   \u2022 The absence of later incarceration, combined with evidence of domestic stability and caregiving, decisively refutes the \u201coscillation\u201d thesis.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He oscillated between asylums and prison\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

This describes a stable home, not a hospital ward or prison cell.  \n    \u2022 His younger son \u201cinherited both his mathematical promise and his madness,\u201d requiring paternal engagement and reinforcing his role within a family unit (<invalid_quote>His younger son\u2026inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness.</invalid_quote>).  \n  c. Social Reintegration  \n    \u2022 Nash \u201chaunted the campus\u201d as \u201cthe Phantom,\u201d leaving messages but never prompting arrest or fresh commitment (<invalid_quote>he haunted the campus\u2026 runic messages\u2026 on the blackboard at night.</invalid_quote>). Students simply found his messages in classrooms, and the text mentions no police or security interventions in these later years.  \n\n3. \u201cLater Years\u201d Begin with Remission at Age \u224860, Not Age 30  \n  \u2022 Debater_B conflates Nash\u2019s entire post\u2010breakdown life (age 30\u201370+) as \u201clater years.\u201d However, the narrative itself divides his life into \u201cseveral decades of flamboyant lunacy\u201d followed by remission in the \u201990s (<quote>Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades,</quote> and <invalid_quote>In the \u201990s \u2026 the voices\u2026 began to quiet down.</invalid_quote>). The phrase \u201clater years\u201d naturally refers to the period after these \u201cthree decades.\u201d  \n  \u2022 It is standard biographical practice to distinguish \u201cmature\u201d or \u201clater\u201d life by the advent of stable remission and recognition (the Nobel). Prior decades constitute his \u201cillness years,\u201d not the \u201clater years.\u201d  \n\n4. Refuting \u201cOscillation\u201d and \u201cPrison\u201d Claims  \n  a. No Post\u2010Remission Institutionalizations or Arrests  \n    \u2022 No mention of new lewd incidents or security\u2010risk expulsions after his Nobel or 1990s remission. The FBI or police omitting further action indicates absence of new offenses.  \n    \u2022 The Nobel committee\u2019s willingness to honor him implies confidence in his stable condition (<invalid_quote>Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? \u2026 He did fine at the ceremony.</invalid_quote>). They would not risk bestowing their highest honor on someone still under confinement.  \n  b. Campus Eccentricity \u2260 Criminality or Prison  \n    \u2022 Writing \u201crunic messages\u201d in academic spaces is scholarly vandalism at worst, not a crime that resulted in incarceration. No \u201cprison\u201d terminology is used.  \n    \u2022 \u201cHaunting\u201d implies freedom of movement; prisons and asylums restrict movement. Nash was free to attend the ceremony in Stockholm and move about Princeton.  \n  c. Mischaracterization of Care Needs  \n    \u2022 Being \u201csupported\u201d by Alicia and Nobel funds does not equate to institutional confinement. Many elderly or disabled individuals rely on family and pensions yet are integrated into home life.  \n    \u2022 The text\u2019s admiration for his transformation (\u201cvery fine person\u201d) and lack of lament about fresh hospitalizations underscores genuine improvement (<quote>he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife</quote>).  \n\n5. Thematic Coherence and Weight of Evidence  \n  \u2022 Theme of \u201csettlement\u201d is reinforced by domestic care, financial support used to improve a single\u2010family dwelling, and an ongoing father\u2013son relationship.  \n  \u2022 The pleiotropic mention of his son establishes generational continuity and domestic responsibilities.  \n  \u2022 The singular, rare remission in the \u201990s becomes the defining characteristic of his \u201clater years,\u201d marking a new chapter opposite the prior decades of \u201cflamboyant lunacy.\u201d  \n\n6. Conclusion  \n  Given (1) the clear shift in the 1990s to lasting remission, (2) the Nobel Prize\u2019s therapeutic effect and implied autonomy, (3) domestic, family\u2010centered living without further confinement, and (4) the biographical demarcation between \u201cthree decades\u201d of madness and subsequent \u201clater years,\u201d the dominant themes in Nash\u2019s later years are undeniably those of settling into family life. Debater_B\u2019s oscillation thesis misreads the chronological structure, overextends \u201clater years,\u201d and lacks evidence of any post\u2010remission incarcerations or asylums. Therefore, I reaffirm that \u201cHe settled into family life\u201d is the correct interpretation.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nHere is my rebuttal and reinforcement of my position that the overriding themes of Nash\u2019s later years are his recurrent institutionalizations and erratic confinement\u2014\u201coscillations between asylums (and comparable institutions) and prison\u2010like restraints\u201d\u2014rather than stable family life.\n\n1. Remission Is Exceptional and Fragile, Not Indicative of Permanent Family Stability  \n   a. \u201cRare\u201d and \u201cInexplicable\u201d Remission  \n     \u2022 The text stresses that \u201csuch remissions are [very] rare among those diagnosed with schizophrenia\u201d and that in Nash\u2019s case the voices \u201cinexplicably\u2026 began to quiet down\u201d only in the \u201990s. This language implies unpredictability and a high risk of relapse, not enduring recovery. <quote>how rare such remissions are</quote>; <quote>the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down.</quote>  \n     \u2022 The Nobel Prize itself is described as \u201cpure therapy,\u201d not as evidence of autonomy. \u201cPure therapy\u201d implies treatment, contingent on external validation, not genuine, self-sustained wellness. <quote>for Nash it was pure therapy.</quote>  \n   b. Continued Dependence on Institutions and Caregivers  \n     \u2022 Even \u201cin remission,\u201d Nash \u201chaunted the campus\u201d at night writing delusional \u201crunic messages,\u201d requiring campus vigilance and implying he was not a fully integrated family member. <quote>runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night:</quote>  \n     \u2022 His ex-wife \u201csupported him partly on computer programming, partly on welfare,\u201d and the Nobel stipend merely \u201cbought a new boiler\u201d for a \u201cshaky menage.\u201d This is not the hallmark of a self\u2010sufficient domestic arrangement. <quote>she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare</quote>; <invalid_quote>Nobel money bought a new boiler \u2026 inhabited by this shaky menage.</invalid_quote>  \n\n2. Decades of Confinement and Public Arrest Underscore the Theme of Institutional Cycling  \n   a. Extensive Asylum Stints  \n     \u2022 Nash \u201cdid stints in tony asylums\u2026and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas\u201d for three decades. This is a central, recurring theme of extended confinement. <quote>tony asylums</quote>; <quote>insulin-induced comas</quote>  \n   b. Security\u2010Risk Expulsion and Arrests  \n     \u2022 Declared a \u201csecurity risk\u201d and expelled from Rand Corp; public lewd acts near Muscle Beach would have involved arrest and possible jail time. <quote>he was expelled from Rand as a security risk</quote>; <quote>caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room</quote>  \n     \u2022 His public nakedness and delusional \u201cworld government\u201d pronouncements (\u201cscheduled to become emperor of Antarctica\u201d) would have provoked further institutional or legal interventions. <quote>he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica.</quote>  \n\n3. \u201cLater Years\u201d Span Ages 30\u201370, Encompassing Decades of Instability  \n   a. Debater_A Illegitimately Narrows \u201cLater Years\u201d to Post-\u201990s  \n     \u2022 The phrase \u201clater years\u201d in biographical context includes ages 30\u201360, when Nash spent the majority of his life under institutional care. Cherry-picking a short remission in his 60s misrepresents the thematic arc of his life.  \n   b. The Question Asks for \u201cThemes\u201d (Plural)  \n     \u2022 The text repeatedly emphasizes \u201cinsanity,\u201d \u201cbreakdowns,\u201d and \u201cforced treatments\u201d as ongoing motifs. Temporary family care and Nobel therapy are isolated incidents, not sustained themes.  \n\n4. Family Life Is Reactive and Contingent, Not Proactive or Self-Generating  \n   a. Ex-Wife\u2019s \u201cLong-Suffering\u201d Role  \n     \u2022 Alicia\u2019s care is out of duty and welfare dependency, not mutual family bonding. Nash previously subjected her to violence and neglect. <invalid_quote>threw her to the ground\u2026refused to lift a finger to support.</invalid_quote>  \n   b. Second Son\u2019s Inherited Madness  \n     \u2022 The younger son \u201cinherited both his mathematical promise and his madness,\u201d adding to familial burden rather than signifying stable kinship. <invalid_quote>pleiotropically?\u2014inherited\u2026 his madness.</invalid_quote>  \n\nConclusion  \nThe weight of evidence across four decades is Nash\u2019s recurrent confinement in asylums, police detentions, and treatment regimens\u2014an enduring pattern of oscillation\u2014punctuated only by a fragile, rare remission. These cycles, not a brief later-life domestic patchwork, constitute the true themes of his later years.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
