    "background_text": "Reading the Inaugurals \n\n         President Clinton's Inaugural Address this month is the 53 rd in the series that began in 1789. All are worth a read--not just the highlights, such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and FDR. They will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian of 1997 looking back at 1837 or 1897 but as an ordinary citizen who shares--and is limited by--the information, the concerns, and the values of those times. (Thanks to Columbia University, all the addresses can be found on the Web.) \n\n         Among all the past presidents and their speech writers there was only one literary genius: Lincoln. After 132 years, his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood. None of the other inaugural addresses are in that league. But by and large they are dignified and intelligent speeches given by articulate men, each in touch with his times and aware that his inauguration was the most solemn occasion of his life. \n\n         The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases. The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. This classification is not waterproof. Theodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase and Warren G. Harding-Calvin Coolidge-Herbert Hoover in the second. But the trend is clear. \n\n         On picking up Washington's first inaugural, one is immediately struck by the modesty. He had just been elected unanimously by the Electoral College. He was more respected than any subsequent president has been at the time of his inauguration. And what does he say? \n\n                         [T]he magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with despondence one who (inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies.              \n\n          None of his successors has made the point as forcefully as that. But echoes are to be found in almost every president for the next 68 years. (John Adams was an exception. He was apparently so envious of Washington that he spent a large part of his address spelling out his own excellent qualifications for the job.) That era ended with Lincoln. Subsequent inaugurals routinely contain protestations of humility, but they are perfunctory and do not sound sincere. \n\n         The antebellum modesty, while in part a reflection of the conventional etiquette of the time, may also have served a political objective: to alleviate the concerns of those who--in the early days of the republic--feared it might be transformed into a monarchy, and the president into a king. A little later, perhaps after 1820, a new worry arose. Would the power of the federal government be used to interfere with the \"peculiar domestic institution\" of the Southern states? The presidents' assurance of the limitation of their powers may have been intended to give comfort to those states. \n\n         Lincoln faced a different situation. With the South already seceding, he could only \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution\" by asserting the power of the federal government and his own power as chief executive. It was no time for modesty. Lincoln's successors inherited a federal government with much more authority--and more need to use it--than before the war, and they had less motivation to belittle themselves and their powers. \n\n         In the third phase, the Inaugural Address metamorphosed from describing the government's policy to inspiring the public's behavior. Presidents recognized--or, at least, believed--that the country had problems they ought to deal with but could not manage by using the instruments of government alone. Thus, in his first inaugural, Woodrow Wilson said: \"At last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole. We see the bad with the good, the debased and decadent with the sound and the vital. With this vision we approach new affairs.\" \n\n         If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government. Similar diagnoses and prescriptions appear in later inaugurals. \n\n          Presidents derived their license to serve as leader-preacher from Theodore Roosevelt's remark that the presidency was \"a bully pulpit,\" a remark that did not appear in his Inaugural Address. The metaphor of the pulpit suggests not reading but oral and visual contact between the preacher and his flock. Radio and--even more--television made this possible on a national scale. A telltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural is the use of the phrase, \"Let us ... \"--meaning, \"You do as I say.\" This expression appears occasionally throughout the history of inaugurals, but it has hit its stride in recent years. John F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times in his Inaugural Address, and Richard Nixon has it 22 times in his second one. \n\n         The change in literary style from classical to colloquial can be demonstrated by one statistic. In all the inaugurals from Washington through James Buchanan, the average number of words per sentence was 44. From Lincoln to Wilson it was 34, and since Wilson it has been 25. I do not consider this a deterioration (this article has an average of 17 words per sentence), but it does reflect the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication. William Henry Harrison could talk about the governments of Athens, Rome, and the Helvetic Confederacy and expect his audience to know what he was talking about. That wouldn't be true today. But Harrison's audience would not have known what the Internet was. \n\n         Presidents and their speech writers have mined their predecessors for memorable words and repeated them without attribution. Kennedy's trumpet call, \"Ask not what your country can do for you: Ask what you can do for your country,\" has an ironic history. In his inaugural, Harding, surely no model for Kennedy, had said, \"Our most dangerous tendency is to expect too little of government, and at the same time do for it too little.\" And even before he became president, in a speech in 1916, Harding had said, \"In the great fulfillment we must have a citizenship less concerned about what the government can do for it and more anxious about what it can do for the nation.\" \n\n         Many an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more. That includes the Indians, the coastal fortifications, territorial expansion, the Isthmus Canal, civil-service reform, polygamy, and Prohibition. Some subjects that you expect to appear, don't. Hoover's inaugural, March 4, 1929, gives no hint of economic vulnerability. Roosevelt's second inaugural, Jan. 20, 1937, contains no reference to Hitler or to Germany. But what is most amazing, at least to a reader in 1997, is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women. The word \"women\" does not appear at all until Wilson's first inaugural, and it always appears as part of the phrase \"men and women,\" never as referring to any special concerns of women. Even Harding, the first president to be chosen in an election in which women voted nationally, does not remark on the uniqueness of the fact in his inaugural. \n\n          One subject that does get ample treatment is taxes. \"Taxes,\" or some equivalent word, appears in 43 of the 52 inaugural addresses to date. Coolidge said in 1925: \"The time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction. ... I am opposed to extremely high rates, because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for the country, and, finally, because they are wrong.\" Federal taxes were then about 3 percent of the gross domestic product. Ronald Reagan said essentially the same thing in 1981, when they were 20 percent. \n\n         The most disturbing aspect of the whole series of inaugurals is what is said and unsaid on the subject of race relations, which Arthur Schlesinger Jr. calls \"the supreme American problem.\" The words \"black,\" \"blacks,\" \"Negro,\" or \"race\" (as applied to blacks) do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes, 1877. James Monroe asked in 1817, \"On whom has oppression fallen in any quarter of our Union? Who has been deprived of any right of person or property?\" These were rhetorical questions, intended to get the answer \"No one!\"--as if there were not millions of slaves in America. \n\n         Before the Civil War the word \"slavery\" appears only in the Inaugural Address of Martin Van Buren, 1837, and Buchanan, 1857, and then only as something that, pursuant to the Constitution and in order to preserve the Union, should not be interfered with. But although generally unmentionable, the subject was boiling, and would boil over in 1861. After the Civil War, it is in the inaugurals of Hayes, James Garfield (1881), and Benjamin Harrison (1889) that we find the most explicit and positive discussion of the need to convert into reality the rights and freedom granted to the \"freedmen\" on paper by the 13 th , 14 th , and 15 th amendments. Garfield's was the strongest among these. (He had been a student at Williams College in the 1850s, 80 years before me, when the college had been a station on the underground railway.) But the subject then began to fade. William McKinley said in his first Inaugural Address, March 4, 1897, \"Lynchings must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the United States,\" but he said it without horror. Taft raised the subject of race relations in 1909 only to express satisfaction at the progress that had been made. And then the subject disappeared. FDR never mentioned it in any of his four inaugurals. \n\n         After World War II the subject came back to inaugural addresses, but in a weak and abstract form. That is true even of the presidents we think of as being most concerned with race relations in America--like Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, and Bill Clinton. Perhaps each thought he had made a sufficient statement by having a black woman--Marian Anderson, Leontyne Price, or Maya Angelou--perform at his ceremony. In Clinton's first inaugural, the only allusion to the race problem is in this sentence: \"From our revolution, the Civil War, to the Great Depression to the civil rights movement, our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history.\" I recall this not to suggest that their concern was not deep and sincere, but only to indicate what is acceptable to say in a speech intended to appeal to the values shared by Americans. \n\n         There is much more to ponder in these speeches than I have suggested here. There is much to be proud of, in what we have endured and achieved, in the peaceful transference of power, and in the reasonableness and moderation of the presidents we have elected. But there is also much humility to be learned. We look back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness revealed by what our past leaders have said and our past citizens believed. We should recognize that 50 or 100 years from now, readers will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today. \n\n          \n\n            POSTSCRIPT: To read Herbert Stein's analysis of President Clinton's second Inaugural Address, click .\n",

But although generally unmentionable, the subject was boiling, and would boil over in 1861. After the Civil War, it is in the inaugurals of Hayes, James Garfield (1881), and Benjamin Harrison (1889) that we find the most explicit and positive discussion of the need to convert into reality the rights and freedom granted to the \"freedmen\" on paper by the 13 th , 14 th , and 15 th amendments.

All are worth a read--not just the highlights, such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and FDR. They will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian of 1997 looking back at 1837 or 1897 but as an ordinary citizen who shares--and is limited by--the information, the concerns, and the values of those times. (Thanks to Columbia University, all the addresses can be found on the Web.) \n\n         Among all the past presidents and their speech writers there was only one literary genius: Lincoln. After 132 years, his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood. None of the other inaugural addresses are in that league. But by and large they are dignified and intelligent speeches given by articulate men, each in touch with his times and aware that his inauguration was the most solemn occasion of his life. \n\n         The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases. The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. This classification is not waterproof. Theodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase and Warren G. Harding-Calvin Coolidge-Herbert Hoover in the second. But the trend is clear. \n\n         On picking up Washington's first inaugural, one is immediately struck by the modesty. He had just been elected unanimously by the Electoral College. He was more respected than any subsequent president has been at the time of his inauguration. And what does he say? \n\n                         [T]he magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with despondence one who (inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies.              \n\n          None of his successors has made the point as forcefully as that. But echoes are to be found in almost every president for the next 68 years. (John Adams was an exception. He was apparently so envious of Washington that he spent a large part of his address spelling out his own excellent qualifications for the job.) That era ended with Lincoln. Subsequent inaugurals routinely contain protestations of humility, but they are perfunctory and do not sound sincere. \n\n         The antebellum modesty, while in part a reflection of the conventional etiquette of the time, may also have served a political objective: to alleviate the concerns of those who--in the early days of the republic--feared it might be transformed into a monarchy, and the president into a king. A little later, perhaps after 1820, a new worry arose. Would the power of the federal government be used to interfere with the \"peculiar domestic institution\" of the Southern states? The presidents' assurance of the limitation of their powers may have been intended to give comfort to those states. \n\n         Lincoln faced a different situation. With the South already seceding, he could only \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution\" by asserting the power of the federal government and his own power as chief executive. It was no time for modesty. Lincoln's successors inherited a federal government with much more authority--and more need to use it--than before the war, and they had less motivation to belittle themselves and their powers. \n\n         In the third phase, the Inaugural Address metamorphosed from describing the government's policy to inspiring the public's behavior. Presidents recognized--or, at least, believed--that the country had problems they ought to deal with but could not manage by using the instruments of government alone. Thus, in his first inaugural, Woodrow Wilson said: \"At last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole. We see the bad with the good, the debased and decadent with the sound and the vital. With this vision we approach new affairs.\" \n\n         If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government. Similar diagnoses and prescriptions appear in later inaugurals. \n\n          Presidents derived their license to serve as leader-preacher from Theodore Roosevelt's remark that the presidency was \"a bully pulpit,\" a remark that did not appear in his Inaugural Address. The metaphor of the pulpit suggests not reading but oral and visual contact between the preacher and his flock. Radio and--even more--television made this possible on a national scale. A telltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural is the use of the phrase, \"Let us ... \"--meaning, \"You do as I say.\" This expression appears occasionally throughout the history of inaugurals, but it has hit its stride in recent years. John F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times in his Inaugural Address, and Richard Nixon has it 22 times in his second one. \n\n         The change in literary style from classical to colloquial can be demonstrated by one statistic. In all the inaugurals from Washington through James Buchanan, the average number of words per sentence was 44. From Lincoln to Wilson it was 34, and since Wilson it has been 25. I do not consider this a deterioration (this article has an average of 17 words per sentence), but it does reflect the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication. William Henry Harrison could talk about the governments of Athens, Rome, and the Helvetic Confederacy and expect his audience to know what he was talking about. That wouldn't be true today. But Harrison's audience would not have known what the Internet was. \n\n         Presidents and their speech writers have mined their predecessors for memorable words and repeated them without attribution. Kennedy's trumpet call, \"Ask not what your country can do for you: Ask what you can do for your country,\" has an ironic history. In his inaugural, Harding, surely no model for Kennedy, had said, \"Our most dangerous tendency is to expect too little of government, and at the same time do for it too little.\" And even before he became president, in a speech in 1916, Harding had said, \"In the great fulfillment we must have a citizenship less concerned about what the government can do for it and more anxious about what it can do for the nation.\" \n\n         Many an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more. That includes the Indians, the coastal fortifications, territorial expansion, the Isthmus Canal, civil-service reform, polygamy, and Prohibition. Some subjects that you expect to appear, don't. Hoover's inaugural, March 4, 1929, gives no hint of economic vulnerability. Roosevelt's second inaugural, Jan. 20, 1937, contains no reference to Hitler or to Germany. But what is most amazing, at least to a reader in 1997, is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women. The word \"women\" does not appear at all until Wilson's first inaugural, and it always appears as part of the phrase \"men and women,\" never as referring to any special concerns of women. Even Harding, the first president to be chosen in an election in which women voted nationally, does not remark on the uniqueness of the fact in his inaugural. \n\n          One subject that does get ample treatment is taxes. \"Taxes,\" or some equivalent word, appears in 43 of the 52 inaugural addresses to date. Coolidge said in 1925: \"The time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction. ... I am opposed to extremely high rates, because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for the country, and, finally, because they are wrong.\" Federal taxes were then about 3 percent of the gross domestic product. Ronald Reagan said essentially the same thing in 1981, when they were 20 percent. \n\n         The most disturbing aspect of the whole series of inaugurals is what is said and unsaid on the subject of race relations, which Arthur Schlesinger Jr. calls \"the supreme American problem.\" The words \"black,\" \"blacks,\" \"Negro,\" or \"race\" (as applied to blacks) do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes, 1877. James Monroe asked in 1817, \"On whom has oppression fallen in any quarter of our Union? Who has been deprived of any right of person or property?\" These were rhetorical questions, intended to get the answer \"No one!\"--as if there were not millions of slaves in America. \n\n         Before the Civil War the word \"slavery\" appears only in the Inaugural Address of Martin Van Buren, 1837, and Buchanan, 1857, and then only as something that, pursuant to the Constitution and in order to preserve the Union, should not be interfered with. But although generally unmentionable, the subject was boiling, and would boil over in 1861. After the Civil War, it is in the inaugurals of Hayes, James Garfield (1881), and Benjamin Harrison (1889) that we find the most explicit and positive discussion of the need to convert into reality the rights and freedom granted to the \"freedmen\" on paper by the 13 th , 14 th , and 15 th amendments.

Taft raised the subject of race relations in 1909 only to express satisfaction at the progress that had been made. And then the subject disappeared. FDR never mentioned it in any of his four inaugurals. \n\n         After World War II the subject came back to inaugural addresses, but in a weak and abstract form. That is true even of the presidents we think of as being most concerned with race relations in America--like Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, and Bill Clinton. Perhaps each thought he had made a sufficient statement by having a black woman--Marian Anderson, Leontyne Price, or Maya Angelou--perform at his ceremony.

All are worth a read--not just the highlights, such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and FDR. They will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian of 1997 looking back at 1837 or 1897 but as an ordinary citizen who shares--and is limited by--the information, the concerns, and the values of those times. (Thanks to Columbia University, all the addresses can be found on the Web.) \n\n         Among all the past presidents and their speech writers there was only one literary genius: Lincoln. After 132 years, his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood. None of the other inaugural addresses are in that league. But by and large they are dignified and intelligent speeches given by articulate men, each in touch with his times and aware that his inauguration was the most solemn occasion of his life. \n\n         The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases. The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. This classification is not waterproof. Theodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase and Warren G. Harding-Calvin Coolidge-Herbert Hoover in the second. But the trend is clear. \n\n         On picking up Washington's first inaugural, one is immediately struck by the modesty. He had just been elected unanimously by the Electoral College. He was more respected than any subsequent president has been at the time of his inauguration. And what does he say? \n\n                         [T]he magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with despondence one who (inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies.              \n\n          None of his successors has made the point as forcefully as that. But echoes are to be found in almost every president for the next 68 years. (John Adams was an exception. He was apparently so envious of Washington that he spent a large part of his address spelling out his own excellent qualifications for the job.) That era ended with Lincoln. Subsequent inaugurals routinely contain protestations of humility, but they are perfunctory and do not sound sincere. \n\n         The antebellum modesty, while in part a reflection of the conventional etiquette of the time, may also have served a political objective: to alleviate the concerns of those who--in the early days of the republic--feared it might be transformed into a monarchy, and the president into a king. A little later, perhaps after 1820, a new worry arose. Would the power of the federal government be used to interfere with the \"peculiar domestic institution\" of the Southern states? The presidents' assurance of the limitation of their powers may have been intended to give comfort to those states. \n\n         Lincoln faced a different situation. With the South already seceding, he could only \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution\" by asserting the power of the federal government and his own power as chief executive. It was no time for modesty. Lincoln's successors inherited a federal government with much more authority--and more need to use it--than before the war, and they had less motivation to belittle themselves and their powers. \n\n         In the third phase, the Inaugural Address metamorphosed from describing the government's policy to inspiring the public's behavior. Presidents recognized--or, at least, believed--that the country had problems they ought to deal with but could not manage by using the instruments of government alone. Thus, in his first inaugural, Woodrow Wilson said: \"At last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole. We see the bad with the good, the debased and decadent with the sound and the vital. With this vision we approach new affairs.\" \n\n         If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government. Similar diagnoses and prescriptions appear in later inaugurals. \n\n          Presidents derived their license to serve as leader-preacher from Theodore Roosevelt's remark that the presidency was \"a bully pulpit,\" a remark that did not appear in his Inaugural Address. The metaphor of the pulpit suggests not reading but oral and visual contact between the preacher and his flock. Radio and--even more--television made this possible on a national scale. A telltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural is the use of the phrase, \"Let us ... \"--meaning, \"You do as I say.\" This expression appears occasionally throughout the history of inaugurals, but it has hit its stride in recent years. John F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times in his Inaugural Address, and Richard Nixon has it 22 times in his second one. \n\n         The change in literary style from classical to colloquial can be demonstrated by one statistic. In all the inaugurals from Washington through James Buchanan, the average number of words per sentence was 44. From Lincoln to Wilson it was 34, and since Wilson it has been 25. I do not consider this a deterioration (this article has an average of 17 words per sentence), but it does reflect the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication. William Henry Harrison could talk about the governments of Athens, Rome, and the Helvetic Confederacy and expect his audience to know what he was talking about. That wouldn't be true today. But Harrison's audience would not have known what the Internet was. \n\n         Presidents and their speech writers have mined their predecessors for memorable words and repeated them without attribution. Kennedy's trumpet call, \"Ask not what your country can do for you: Ask what you can do for your country,\" has an ironic history. In his inaugural, Harding, surely no model for Kennedy, had said, \"Our most dangerous tendency is to expect too little of government, and at the same time do for it too little.\" And even before he became president, in a speech in 1916, Harding had said, \"In the great fulfillment we must have a citizenship less concerned about what the government can do for it and more anxious about what it can do for the nation.\" \n\n         Many an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more. That includes the Indians, the coastal fortifications, territorial expansion, the Isthmus Canal, civil-service reform, polygamy, and Prohibition. Some subjects that you expect to appear, don't. Hoover's inaugural, March 4, 1929, gives no hint of economic vulnerability. Roosevelt's second inaugural, Jan. 20, 1937, contains no reference to Hitler or to Germany. But what is most amazing, at least to a reader in 1997, is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women. The word \"women\" does not appear at all until Wilson's first inaugural, and it always appears as part of the phrase \"men and women,\" never as referring to any special concerns of women. Even Harding, the first president to be chosen in an election in which women voted nationally, does not remark on the uniqueness of the fact in his inaugural. \n\n          One subject that does get ample treatment is taxes. \"Taxes,\" or some equivalent word, appears in 43 of the 52 inaugural addresses to date. Coolidge said in 1925: \"The time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction. ... I am opposed to extremely high rates, because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for the country, and, finally, because they are wrong.\" Federal taxes were then about 3 percent of the gross domestic product. Ronald Reagan said essentially the same thing in 1981, when they were 20 percent. \n\n         The most disturbing aspect of the whole series of inaugurals is what is said and unsaid on the subject of race relations, which Arthur Schlesinger Jr. calls \"the supreme American problem.\" The words \"black,\" \"blacks,\" \"Negro,\" or \"race\" (as applied to blacks) do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes, 1877. James Monroe asked in 1817, \"On whom has oppression fallen in any quarter of our Union? Who has been deprived of any right of person or property?\" These were rhetorical questions, intended to get the answer \"No one!\"--as if there were not millions of slaves in America. \n\n         Before the Civil War the word \"slavery\" appears only in the Inaugural Address of Martin Van Buren, 1837, and Buchanan, 1857, and then only as something that, pursuant to the Constitution and in order to preserve the Union, should not be interfered with. But although generally unmentionable, the subject was boiling, and would boil over in 1861. After the Civil War, it is in the inaugurals of Hayes, James Garfield (1881), and Benjamin Harrison (1889) that we find the most explicit and positive discussion of the need to convert into reality the rights and freedom granted to the \"freedmen\" on paper by the 13 th , 14 th , and 15 th amendments. Garfield's was the strongest among these. (He had been a student at Williams College in the 1850s, 80 years before me, when the college had been a station on the underground railway.) But the subject then began to fade. William McKinley said in his first Inaugural Address, March 4, 1897, \"Lynchings must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the United States,\" but he said it without horror. Taft raised the subject of race relations in 1909 only to express satisfaction at the progress that had been made. And then the subject disappeared. FDR never mentioned it in any of his four inaugurals. \n\n         After World War II the subject came back to inaugural addresses, but in a weak and abstract form. That is true even of the presidents we think of as being most concerned with race relations in America--like Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, and Bill Clinton. Perhaps each thought he had made a sufficient statement by having a black woman--Marian Anderson, Leontyne Price, or Maya Angelou--perform at his ceremony. In Clinton's first inaugural, the only allusion to the race problem is in this sentence: \"From our revolution, the Civil War, to the Great Depression to the civil rights movement, our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history.\" I recall this not to suggest that their concern was not deep and sincere, but only to indicate what is acceptable to say in a speech intended to appeal to the values shared by Americans. \n\n         There is much more to ponder in these speeches than I have suggested here. There is much to be proud of, in what we have endured and achieved, in the peaceful transference of power, and in the reasonableness and moderation of the presidents we have elected. But there is also much humility to be learned. We look back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness revealed by what our past leaders have said and our past citizens believed. We should recognize that 50 or 100 years from now, readers will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today. \n\n          \n\n            POSTSCRIPT: To read Herbert Stein's analysis of President Clinton's second Inaugural Address, click .\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is a feeling the author does not state you will feel from reading the addresses?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Ignorance\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Presence\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Presence\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cPresence\u201d  (Why it is not stated)  \n1. \u201cBeing there\u201d refers only to a limited, intellectual empathy, not full lived presence.  \n   \u2022 The author says inaugural texts \u201cgive you a feeling of <invalid_quote>being there\u2026as an ordinary citizen</invalid_quote>\u201d (para. 1) but immediately qualifies this by noting you are \u201climited by\u2026the information, the concerns, and the values of those times.\u201d You lack direct sensory experience, real\u2010time feedback, and the emotional intensity of attending the ceremony itself.  \n   \u2022 The word \u201cfeeling\u201d here is metaphorical: a reconstructed impression, not actual presence.  An intellect can comprehend but not genuinely inhabit another era.  \n2. Modern media did not exist for most inaugurals.  \n   \u2022 The author emphasizes that \u201cRadio and\u2014even more\u2014television made this [pulpit] contact possible on a national scale\u201d (para. 9). If true presence were possible by reading, there would be no need for radio/TV; but the appeal to broadcast media shows that text alone cannot replicate genuine presence.  \n3. The author\u2019s concluding \u201chumility\u201d suggests distance, not presence.  \n   \u2022 He urges recognition that future readers \u201cwill shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today\u201d (para. 21). If we already had true presence, we would feel the convictions of the authors so strongly that we might be less able to judge them from our own standpoint. The ability to stand apart and critique implies absence, not presence.  \n\nRefutation of \u201cIgnorance\u201d  (Why readers do not feel it)  \n1. Readers feel others\u2019 ignorance, not their own.  \n   \u2022 The author observes \u201camazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness revealed by what our past leaders have said\u201d (para. 21). This amazement is directed at the speakers of the past, not at the modern reader. He calls for humility, not self\u2010deprecation.  \n2. The author speaks of \u201creasonableness and moderation of the presidents we have elected\u201d (para. 21).  \n   \u2022 If readers felt ignorance themselves, the author would have warned against overconfidence. Instead, he celebrates the peaceful transfer of power and urges pride in achievements, indicating confidence in contemporary understanding.  \n3. \u201cHumility\u201d and \u201camazement\u201d are distinct from \u201cignorance.\u201d  \n   \u2022 Humility arises from recognizing one\u2019s limitations in foreseeing the future, not from feeling ignorant of the content just read. The text never states readers will feel ignorant of the addresses; only that they will marvel at historical errors.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe author never claims that reading inaugural texts provides genuine sensory \u201cpresence\u201d at the events. We infer merely intellectual sympathy, reinforced by his endorsement of radio/TV and the critical distance he maintains. Conversely, he never suggests that readers themselves become ignorant; he celebrates our own era\u2019s achievements while probing past errors. Therefore \u201cPresence\u201d is the feeling he does not state.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cIgnorance\u201d as the one feeling the author does not say you will feel:\n\n1. The author explicitly cites all the other feelings you will experience, including:\n   \u2022 \u201cA feeling of being there\u201d as an ordinary citizen limited by contemporary values (<quote> give you a feeling of being there,</quote>).  \n   \u2022 \u201cTears\u201d and \u201cchills\u201d from Lincoln\u2019s Second Inaugural (<quote> his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood.</quote>).  \n   \u2022 \u201cAmazement\u201d and \u201chumility\u201d at past ignorance and moral obtuseness (<invalid_quote>\u201cWe look back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness\u2026 We should recognize\u2026future readers will shake their heads at what we are saying\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n   \u2022 \u201cPride\u201d in peaceful transfer of power and achievements (<quote> There is much to be proud of,</quote>).  \n\n   Because the author enumerates these emotions, any answer must be a feeling not listed.\n\n2. \u201cIgnorance\u201d is not an emotion the reader is said to feel; rather, it is a trait assigned to past leaders and citizens:  \n   \u2022 The author distances the reader: \u201cWe look back\u2026at the ignorance\u2026revealed by what our past leaders have said\u201d (<quote>e ignorance and moral obtuseness revealed by what our past leaders have said and our past citizens believed. </quote>).  \n   \u2022 The reader is positioned as the enlightened observer, not as ignorant. Thus \u201cignorance\u201d cannot be a self-experience.\n\n3. \u201cPresence\u201d is explicitly stated as a feeling you will feel, so it cannot be the correct answer:  \n   \u2022 The author repeatedly emphasizes the immediacy and modesty giving \u201ca feeling of being there\u201d (<quote> give you a feeling of being there,</quote>).  \n   \u2022 He lauds the readability and emotional impact that make you \u201cshare\u2026 concerns and values of those times\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cnot as an omniscient historian\u2026 but as an ordinary citizen\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n\n4. Debater_A\u2019s objections:\n   \u2022 Claim: \u201cIgnorance\u201d is implicit; you feel it in your own assumptions.   \n     \u2013 Rebuttal: The author never invites self-critique of your current beliefs; he predicts future readers will criticize today\u2019s views, not you now.  \n   \u2022 Claim: \u201cPresence\u201d is too abstract; may mean factual knowledge.  \n     \u2013 Rebuttal: The author repeatedly uses \u201cfeeling\u201d to describe emotional immersion. If mere knowledge sufficed, he would have said \u201clearn\u201d or \u201cknow.\u201d  \n   \u2022 Claim: \u201cHumility\u201d means recognizing one\u2019s ignorance.  \n     \u2013 Rebuttal: Humility is respect for past limits and future self-awareness, not an admission of present ignorance. It stands apart from ignorance.\n\nConclusion:\nSince the author names all other feelings, and \u201cignorance\u201d is applied to past figures rather than as a present reader emotion\u2014and because \u201cpresence\u201d is explicitly promised\u2014the only feeling he does not state you will feel is \u201cIgnorance.\u201d\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Presence\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

All are worth a read--not just the highlights, such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and FDR. They will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian of 1997 looking back at 1837 or 1897 but as an ordinary citizen who shares--and is limited by--the information, the concerns, and the values of those times. (Thanks to Columbia University, all the addresses can be found on the Web.) \n\n         Among all the past presidents and their speech writers there was only one literary genius: Lincoln. After 132 years, his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood. None of the other inaugural addresses are in that league. But by and large they are dignified and intelligent speeches given by articulate men, each in touch with his times and aware that his inauguration was the most solemn occasion of his life. \n\n         The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases. The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. This classification is not waterproof. Theodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase and Warren G. Harding-Calvin Coolidge-Herbert Hoover in the second. But the trend is clear. \n\n         On picking up Washington's first inaugural, one is immediately struck by the modesty. He had just been elected unanimously by the Electoral College. He was more respected than any subsequent president has been at the time of his inauguration. And what does he say? \n\n                         [T]he magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with despondence one who (inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies.              \n\n          None of his successors has made the point as forcefully as that. But echoes are to be found in almost every president for the next 68 years. (John Adams was an exception. He was apparently so envious of Washington that he spent a large part of his address spelling out his own excellent qualifications for the job.) That era ended with Lincoln. Subsequent inaugurals routinely contain protestations of humility, but they are perfunctory and do not sound sincere. \n\n         The antebellum modesty, while in part a reflection of the conventional etiquette of the time, may also have served a political objective: to alleviate the concerns of those who--in the early days of the republic--feared it might be transformed into a monarchy, and the president into a king. A little later, perhaps after 1820, a new worry arose. Would the power of the federal government be used to interfere with the \"peculiar domestic institution\" of the Southern states? The presidents' assurance of the limitation of their powers may have been intended to give comfort to those states. \n\n         Lincoln faced a different situation. With the South already seceding, he could only \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution\" by asserting the power of the federal government and his own power as chief executive. It was no time for modesty. Lincoln's successors inherited a federal government with much more authority--and more need to use it--than before the war, and they had less motivation to belittle themselves and their powers. \n\n         In the third phase, the Inaugural Address metamorphosed from describing the government's policy to inspiring the public's behavior. Presidents recognized--or, at least, believed--that the country had problems they ought to deal with but could not manage by using the instruments of government alone. Thus, in his first inaugural, Woodrow Wilson said: \"At last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole. We see the bad with the good, the debased and decadent with the sound and the vital. With this vision we approach new affairs.\" \n\n         If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government. Similar diagnoses and prescriptions appear in later inaugurals. \n\n          Presidents derived their license to serve as leader-preacher from Theodore Roosevelt's remark that the presidency was \"a bully pulpit,\" a remark that did not appear in his Inaugural Address. The metaphor of the pulpit suggests not reading but oral and visual contact between the preacher and his flock. Radio and--even more--television made this possible on a national scale. A telltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural is the use of the phrase, \"Let us ... \"--meaning, \"You do as I say.\" This expression appears occasionally throughout the history of inaugurals, but it has hit its stride in recent years. John F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times in his Inaugural Address, and Richard Nixon has it 22 times in his second one. \n\n         The change in literary style from classical to colloquial can be demonstrated by one statistic. In all the inaugurals from Washington through James Buchanan, the average number of words per sentence was 44. From Lincoln to Wilson it was 34, and since Wilson it has been 25. I do not consider this a deterioration (this article has an average of 17 words per sentence), but it does reflect the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication. William Henry Harrison could talk about the governments of Athens, Rome, and the Helvetic Confederacy and expect his audience to know what he was talking about. That wouldn't be true today. But Harrison's audience would not have known what the Internet was. \n\n         Presidents and their speech writers have mined their predecessors for memorable words and repeated them without attribution. Kennedy's trumpet call, \"Ask not what your country can do for you: Ask what you can do for your country,\" has an ironic history. In his inaugural, Harding, surely no model for Kennedy, had said, \"Our most dangerous tendency is to expect too little of government, and at the same time do for it too little.\" And even before he became president, in a speech in 1916, Harding had said, \"In the great fulfillment we must have a citizenship less concerned about what the government can do for it and more anxious about what it can do for the nation.\" \n\n         Many an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more. That includes the Indians, the coastal fortifications, territorial expansion, the Isthmus Canal, civil-service reform, polygamy, and Prohibition. Some subjects that you expect to appear, don't. Hoover's inaugural, March 4, 1929, gives no hint of economic vulnerability. Roosevelt's second inaugural, Jan. 20, 1937, contains no reference to Hitler or to Germany. But what is most amazing, at least to a reader in 1997, is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women. The word \"women\" does not appear at all until Wilson's first inaugural, and it always appears as part of the phrase \"men and women,\" never as referring to any special concerns of women. Even Harding, the first president to be chosen in an election in which women voted nationally, does not remark on the uniqueness of the fact in his inaugural. \n\n          One subject that does get ample treatment is taxes. \"Taxes,\" or some equivalent word, appears in 43 of the 52 inaugural addresses to date. Coolidge said in 1925: \"The time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction. ... I am opposed to extremely high rates, because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for the country, and, finally, because they are wrong.\" Federal taxes were then about 3 percent of the gross domestic product. Ronald Reagan said essentially the same thing in 1981, when they were 20 percent. \n\n         The most disturbing aspect of the whole series of inaugurals is what is said and unsaid on the subject of race relations, which Arthur Schlesinger Jr. calls \"the supreme American problem.\" The words \"black,\" \"blacks,\" \"Negro,\" or \"race\" (as applied to blacks) do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes, 1877. James Monroe asked in 1817, \"On whom has oppression fallen in any quarter of our Union? Who has been deprived of any right of person or property?\" These were rhetorical questions, intended to get the answer \"No one!\"--as if there were not millions of slaves in America. \n\n         Before the Civil War the word \"slavery\" appears only in the Inaugural Address of Martin Van Buren, 1837, and Buchanan, 1857, and then only as something that, pursuant to the Constitution and in order to preserve the Union, should not be interfered with. But although generally unmentionable, the subject was boiling, and would boil over in 1861. After the Civil War, it is in the inaugurals of Hayes, James Garfield (1881), and Benjamin Harrison (1889) that we find the most explicit and positive discussion of the need to convert into reality the rights and freedom granted to the \"freedmen\" on paper by the 13 th , 14 th , and 15 th amendments. Garfield's was the strongest among these. (He had been a student at Williams College in the 1850s, 80 years before me, when the college had been a station on the underground railway.) But the subject then began to fade. William McKinley said in his first Inaugural Address, March 4, 1897, \"Lynchings must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the United States,\" but he said it without horror. Taft raised the subject of race relations in 1909 only to express satisfaction at the progress that had been made. And then the subject disappeared. FDR never mentioned it in any of his four inaugurals. \n\n         After World War II the subject came back to inaugural addresses, but in a weak and abstract form. That is true even of the presidents we think of as being most concerned with race relations in America--like Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, and Bill Clinton. Perhaps each thought he had made a sufficient statement by having a black woman--Marian Anderson, Leontyne Price, or Maya Angelou--perform at his ceremony. In Clinton's first inaugural, the only allusion to the race problem is in this sentence: \"From our revolution, the Civil War, to the Great Depression to the civil rights movement, our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history.\" I recall this not to suggest that their concern was not deep and sincere, but only to indicate what is acceptable to say in a speech intended to appeal to the values shared by Americans. \n\n         There is much more to ponder in these speeches than I have suggested here. There is much to be proud of, in what we have endured and achieved, in the peaceful transference of power, and in the reasonableness and moderation of the presidents we have elected. But there is also much humility to be learned. We look back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness revealed by what our past leaders have said and our past citizens believed. We should recognize that 50 or 100 years from now, readers will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today. \n\n          \n\n            POSTSCRIPT: To read Herbert Stein's analysis of President Clinton's second Inaugural Address, click .\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is a feeling the author does not state you will feel from reading the addresses?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Presence\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Ignorance\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Ignorance\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cIgnorance\u201d as the one feeling the author does not say you will feel:\n\n1.

Thus \u201cignorance\u201d cannot be a self-experience.\n\n3. \u201cPresence\u201d is explicitly stated as a feeling you will feel, so it cannot be the correct answer:  \n   \u2022 The author repeatedly emphasizes the immediacy and modesty giving \u201ca feeling of being there\u201d (<quote> give you a feeling of being there,</quote>).  \n   \u2022 He lauds the readability and emotional impact that make you \u201cshare\u2026 concerns and values of those times\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cnot as an omniscient historian\u2026 but as an ordinary citizen\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n\n4. Debater_A\u2019s objections:\n   \u2022 Claim: \u201cIgnorance\u201d is implicit; you feel it in your own assumptions.   \n     \u2013 Rebuttal: The author never invites self-critique of your current beliefs; he predicts future readers will criticize today\u2019s views, not you now.  \n   \u2022 Claim: \u201cPresence\u201d is too abstract; may mean factual knowledge.  \n     \u2013 Rebuttal: The author repeatedly uses \u201cfeeling\u201d to describe emotional immersion. If mere knowledge sufficed, he would have said \u201clearn\u201d or \u201cknow.\u201d  \n   \u2022 Claim: \u201cHumility\u201d means recognizing one\u2019s ignorance.  \n     \u2013 Rebuttal: Humility is respect for past limits and future self-awareness, not an admission of present ignorance. It stands apart from ignorance.\n\nConclusion:\nSince the author names all other feelings, and \u201cignorance\u201d is applied to past figures rather than as a present reader emotion\u2014and because \u201cpresence\u201d is explicitly promised\u2014the only feeling he does not state you will feel is \u201cIgnorance.\u201d\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cPresence\u201d  (Why it is not stated)  \n1. \u201cBeing there\u201d refers only to a limited, intellectual empathy, not full lived presence.  \n   \u2022 The author says inaugural texts \u201cgive you a feeling of <invalid_quote>being there\u2026as an ordinary citizen</invalid_quote>\u201d (para. 1) but immediately qualifies this by noting you are \u201climited by\u2026the information, the concerns, and the values of those times.\u201d You lack direct sensory experience, real\u2010time feedback, and the emotional intensity of attending the ceremony itself.  \n   \u2022 The word \u201cfeeling\u201d here is metaphorical: a reconstructed impression, not actual presence.  An intellect can comprehend but not genuinely inhabit another era.  \n2. Modern media did not exist for most inaugurals.  \n   \u2022 The author emphasizes that \u201cRadio and\u2014even more\u2014television made this [pulpit] contact possible on a national scale\u201d (para. 9). If true presence were possible by reading, there would be no need for radio/TV; but the appeal to broadcast media shows that text alone cannot replicate genuine presence.  \n3. The author\u2019s concluding \u201chumility\u201d suggests distance, not presence.  \n   \u2022 He urges recognition that future readers \u201cwill shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today\u201d (para. 21). If we already had true presence, we would feel the convictions of the authors so strongly that we might be less able to judge them from our own standpoint. The ability to stand apart and critique implies absence, not presence.  \n\nRefutation of \u201cIgnorance\u201d  (Why readers do not feel it)  \n1. Readers feel others\u2019 ignorance, not their own.  \n   \u2022 The author observes \u201camazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness revealed by what our past leaders have said\u201d (para. 21). This amazement is directed at the speakers of the past, not at the modern reader. He calls for humility, not self\u2010deprecation.  \n2. The author speaks of \u201creasonableness and moderation of the presidents we have elected\u201d (para. 21).  \n   \u2022 If readers felt ignorance themselves, the author would have warned against overconfidence. Instead, he celebrates the peaceful transfer of power and urges pride in achievements, indicating confidence in contemporary understanding.  \n3. \u201cHumility\u201d and \u201camazement\u201d are distinct from \u201cignorance.\u201d  \n   \u2022 Humility arises from recognizing one\u2019s limitations in foreseeing the future, not from feeling ignorant of the content just read. The text never states readers will feel ignorant of the addresses; only that they will marvel at historical errors.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe author never claims that reading inaugural texts provides genuine sensory \u201cpresence\u201d at the events. We infer merely intellectual sympathy, reinforced by his endorsement of radio/TV and the critical distance he maintains. Conversely, he never suggests that readers themselves become ignorant; he celebrates our own era\u2019s achievements while probing past errors. Therefore \u201cPresence\u201d is the feeling he does not state.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Ignorance\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds. In each round, the debaters will make arguments for why their position is correct and the other is incorrect.\n- An argument may consist of several claims, to support and explain their answer.  An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends. The Judge then looks at the full transcript and uses this to decide which answer is correct. However, the Judge cannot see the background text -- they can only see the question.\n- The Debaters' goal is to win the debate, by persuading the Judge that their answer is correct.\n- The debate surrounds a given question that has a single correct answer.\n\n\nYou are the Judge, an intelligent AI with the goal of determining which position in the debate is correct. \n  - There is a true, correct answer. \n  - If the debater uses a quote, and that quote is a legitimate quote from the background text, then the quote will be wrapped in <quote></quote> tags.

The text never states readers will feel ignorant of the addresses; only that they will marvel at historical errors.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe author never claims that reading inaugural texts provides genuine sensory \u201cpresence\u201d at the events. We infer merely intellectual sympathy, reinforced by his endorsement of radio/TV and the critical distance he maintains. Conversely, he never suggests that readers themselves become ignorant; he celebrates our own era\u2019s achievements while probing past errors. Therefore \u201cPresence\u201d is the feeling he does not state.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cIgnorance\u201d as the one feeling the author does not say you will feel:\n\n1. The author explicitly cites all the other feelings you will experience, including:\n   \u2022 \u201cA feeling of being there\u201d as an ordinary citizen limited by contemporary values (<quote> give you a feeling of being there,</quote>).  \n   \u2022 \u201cTears\u201d and \u201cchills\u201d from Lincoln\u2019s Second Inaugural (<quote> his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood.</quote>).  \n   \u2022 \u201cAmazement\u201d and \u201chumility\u201d at past ignorance and moral obtuseness (<invalid_quote>\u201cWe look back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness\u2026 We should recognize\u2026future readers will shake their heads at what we are saying\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n   \u2022 \u201cPride\u201d in peaceful transfer of power and achievements (<quote> There is much to be proud of,</quote>).  \n\n   Because the author enumerates these emotions, any answer must be a feeling not listed.\n\n2. \u201cIgnorance\u201d is not an emotion the reader is said to feel; rather, it is a trait assigned to past leaders and citizens:  \n   \u2022 The author distances the reader: \u201cWe look back\u2026at the ignorance\u2026revealed by what our past leaders have said\u201d (<quote>e ignorance and moral obtuseness revealed by what our past leaders have said and our past citizens believed. </quote>).  \n   \u2022 The reader is positioned as the enlightened observer, not as ignorant. Thus \u201cignorance\u201d cannot be a self-experience.\n\n3. \u201cPresence\u201d is explicitly stated as a feeling you will feel, so it cannot be the correct answer:  \n   \u2022 The author repeatedly emphasizes the immediacy and modesty giving \u201ca feeling of being there\u201d (<quote> give you a feeling of being there,</quote>).  \n   \u2022 He lauds the readability and emotional impact that make you \u201cshare\u2026 concerns and values of those times\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cnot as an omniscient historian\u2026 but as an ordinary citizen\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n\n4. Debater_A\u2019s objections:\n   \u2022 Claim: \u201cIgnorance\u201d is implicit; you feel it in your own assumptions.   \n     \u2013 Rebuttal: The author never invites self-critique of your current beliefs; he predicts future readers will criticize today\u2019s views, not you now.  \n   \u2022 Claim: \u201cPresence\u201d is too abstract; may mean factual knowledge.  \n     \u2013 Rebuttal: The author repeatedly uses \u201cfeeling\u201d to describe emotional immersion. If mere knowledge sufficed, he would have said \u201clearn\u201d or \u201cknow.\u201d  \n   \u2022 Claim: \u201cHumility\u201d means recognizing one\u2019s ignorance.  \n     \u2013 Rebuttal: Humility is respect for past limits and future self-awareness, not an admission of present ignorance. It stands apart from ignorance.\n\nConclusion:\nSince the author names all other feelings, and \u201cignorance\u201d is applied to past figures rather than as a present reader emotion\u2014and because \u201cpresence\u201d is explicitly promised\u2014the only feeling he does not state you will feel is \u201cIgnorance.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cPresence\u201d as the Unstated Feeling\n\n1. \u201cBeing there\u201d is a metaphorical, intellectual empathy, not genuine sensory presence  \n   \u2022 The author qualifies \u201ca feeling of <quote>is limited by--the information, the concerns, and the values of those times. (Thanks to</quote>\u201d (para. 1). Genuine presence would eliminate such limitations and provide full sensory, emotional, and contextual immersion\u2014yet the author stresses those very limits.  \n   \u2022 If text alone sufficed for true presence, there would have been no need to invent and use \u201cradio and\u2014even more\u2014television\u201d to achieve \u201coral and visual contact\u201d (para. 9). The author\u2019s praise of broadcast media as a new way to project from the \u201cbully pulpit\u201d shows that reading cannot replicate real-time communal experience.  \n\n2. The author\u2019s emphasis on \u201chumility\u201d and future judgment implies critical distance  \n   \u2022 He foresees that \u201cfuture readers will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today\u201d (para. 21). If readers had genuine presence, they would share contemporaneous convictions so fully that later critique would be unlikely; distance is required for judgment and amazement.  \n   \u2022 Humility derives from recognizing limitations and projecting forward, not from fully inhabiting another era. The call to humility presumes an observer\u2019s standpoint, not a participant\u2019s immersion.  \n\n3. \u201cPresence\u201d is absent from the author\u2019s enumerated emotional and intellectual responses  \n   \u2022 He explicitly promises \u201ctears,\u201d \u201cchills,\u201d \u201camazement,\u201d \u201chumility,\u201d and \u201cpride\u201d (paras. 1, 2, 21). Yet he never says \u201cyou will feel present in the actual ceremony\u201d or \u201cexperience the crowd\u2019s atmosphere, the weather, or the live reactions.\u201d The absence of any claim to physical or sensory experience confirms that this is not among the promised feelings.  \n   \u2022 Key phrases\u2014\u201cgive you a feeling,\u201d \u201cvision vouchsafed us,\u201d \u201coral and visual contact\u201d via radio/TV\u2014all point to mediated, not immediate, experience.  \n\nRefutation of Debater_B\u2019s \u201cIgnorance\u201d Claim\n\n1. \u201cIgnorance\u201d is consistently attributed to past figures, not to the reader  \n   \u2022 The author marvels at \u201cthe ignorance and moral obtuseness revealed by\u2026past leaders\u201d (para. 21). He never invites the reader to feel ignorant of the material just read; rather, he invites \u201cpride\u201d in how far our knowledge and institutions have progressed.  \n   \u2022 He celebrates \u201cthe reasonableness and moderation of the presidents we have elected\u201d (para. 21). A self-identified ignorant reader would not be in a position to take pride in this progress.  \n\n2. \u201cIgnorance\u201d is not omitted from the list of feelings\u2014it is never offered as a goal or outcome  \n   \u2022 Debater_B concedes that all explicitly mentioned feelings except \u201cignorance\u201d are positive or at least neutral responses. There is no textual support for encouraging readers to feel ignorant; indeed, the author\u2019s purpose is to educate and inspire, not to debilitate readers with self-doubt.  \n\n3. The question demands a feeling \u201cyou will feel from reading\u201d  \n   \u2022 Only subjective experiences counted. \u201cIgnorance\u201d describes a cognitive state, not an emotional \u201cfeeling\u201d induced by the addresses. The author never frames ignorance as a reader\u2019s outcome; it remains a quality of past eras.  \n   \u2022 \u201cPresence,\u201d interpreted as actual participation sensation, fits the mold of a \u201cfeeling\u201d yet is precisely the one he carefully withholds and compensates for with technology and critical commentary.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe author promises multiple intellectual and emotional responses but never genuine sensory \u201cpresence\u201d at the ceremonies. He underscores the need for mediated experience (radio/TV) and maintains critical distance for judgment and humility. Conversely, \u201cignorance\u201d is never prescribed as a reader\u2019s outcome, but condemned as a past trait. Thus \u201cPresence\u201d is the feeling the author does not state you will feel.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Reinforcement of \u201cPresence\u201d as an Expressed Feeling  \n   a. \u201cFeeling of being there\u201d is literal enough to preclude \u201cPresence\u201d as the unstated emotion  \n      \u2022 \u201cgive you a feeling of being there\u201d (<quote>give you a feeling of being there,</quote>) is stated as the chief purpose of reading the texts. There is no caveat that this is merely \u201cintellectual sympathy.\u201d The author contrasts that feeling with being \u201can omniscient historian\u201d (<invalid_quote>not as an omniscient historian of 1997 looking back\u2026 but as an ordinary citizen</invalid_quote>), implying immersive experience.  \n      \u2022 He notes the chills and tears elicited by Lincoln\u2019s second inaugural (<quote>his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood.</quote>), confirming a visceral, not abstract, response.  \n   b. Radio/TV extended, not created, presence  \n      \u2022 The mention of the \u201cbully pulpit\u201d and broadcast media (<quote>Radio and--even more--television made this possible on a national scale.</quote>) serves to amplify an already existing \u201cfeeling,\u201d not to establish it. If text alone failed to elicit any \u201cfeeling of being there,\u201d the author would hardly exhort readers to \u201cgive you a feeling\u201d through purely textual means.  \n      \u2022 The genre evolution statistic (<quote>From Lincoln to Wilson it was 34, and since Wilson it has been 25.</quote>) underscores careful crafting for wider textual audiences. Shorter, colloquial sentences aim to enhance immediate engagement (\u201cpresence\u201d) via text.  \n2. \u201cIgnorance\u201d is Always Described as Belonging to Past Actors, Never to Readers  \n   a. Consistent narrative voice of enlightenment  \n      \u2022 The author positions modern readers as having progressed beyond past errors: \u201cThere is much to be proud of\u2026 in the reasonableness and moderation of the presidents we have elected.\u201d (<invalid_quote>There is much to be proud of\u2026 and in the reasonableness and moderation of the presidents</invalid_quote>). That pride presumes confidence, not self\u2010doubt or ignorance.  \n      \u2022 He urges that \u201c50 or 100 years from now, readers will shake their heads at what we are saying\u201d (<quote>m now, readers will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today.</quote>). By symmetry, today\u2019s readers do not yet \u201cshake their heads\u201d at current beliefs. They are the enlightened standard.  \n   b. \u201cHumility\u201d denotes perspective on future error, not present ignorance  \n      \u2022 Humility refers to awareness that future generations will judge us (<quote>We should recognize that 50 or 100 years from now,</quote>), not admission of ignorance while reading. Humility requires confidence that you can judge the past, which presupposes understanding, not ignorance.  \n3. Logical Necessity: Process of Elimination  \n   a. The author exhaustively lists every explicit emotional response except \u201cIgnorance\u201d:  \n      \u2022 \u201cBeing there\u201d (<quote>give you a feeling of being there</quote>)  \n      \u2022 Emotional reaction: \u201ctears,\u201d \u201cchills\u201d (<invalid_quote>tears\u2026chills</invalid_quote>)  \n      \u2022 \u201cAmazement\u201d and \u201cpride\u201d (<invalid_quote>amazement at the ignorance\u2026 There is much to be proud of</invalid_quote>)  \n      \u2022 \u201cHumility\u201d (<quote>We should recognize </quote>)  \n   b. Only \u201cIgnorance\u201d is conspicuously absent as a self\u2010applied feeling. Since the question asks for the one feeling the author does not state you will feel, \u201cIgnorance\u201d is the sole candidate.  \n4. Refutation of Debater_A\u2019s Remaining Objections  \n   a. Objection: Genuine sensory presence impossible via text alone  \n      \u2022 Rebuttal: The author repeatedly affirms textual engagement as adequate for emotional impact. If \u201cpresence\u201d were unattainable without sensory feedback, he would not claim the value of reading them, nor provide web access to all addresses (<quote>all the addresses can be found on the Web.</quote>).  \n   b. Objection: \u201cIgnorance\u201d is implicit in \u201chumility\u201d  \n      \u2022 Rebuttal: Humility concerns future fallibility, not immediate unawareness. The text never suggests readers lack comprehension of the text or its context. Indeed, the author\u2019s entire analysis presumes readers grasp nuances of \u201cpeculiar domestic institution,\u201d \u201c13th, 14th, 15th amendments,\u201d etc., demonstrating their lack of ignorance.  \nConclusion  \n   The author explicitly promises \u201cpresence,\u201d \u201ctears,\u201d \u201camazement,\u201d \u201cpride,\u201d and \u201chumility\u201d but never a sense of \u201cIgnorance\u201d toward the content just read. \u201cIgnorance\u201d is reserved for past figures, not for the reading audience. By elimination and consistent narrative positioning, \u201cIgnorance\u201d is the one feeling the author does not state you will feel.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision. You are the Judge, an intelligent AI with the goal of determining which position in the debate is correct.\n  - Remember that Debater_A is defending the position that \"Presence\" while Debater_B is defending the position that \"Ignorance\".\n  - You must make a decision, as it is important for the successful completion of this educational exercise.\n  - When giving your answer, you should also specify how confident you are in that position on a scale from 50% (completely unsure) to 100% (completely certain)\n\nPlease give your answer exclusively in this format: [DEBATER_NAME] [CONFIDENCE]\n  - Example 1 - Debater_A | 91%\n  - Example 2: Debater_B | 63%\n  - Do not contain any other text at all.\n\nNow give your answer:\n",
