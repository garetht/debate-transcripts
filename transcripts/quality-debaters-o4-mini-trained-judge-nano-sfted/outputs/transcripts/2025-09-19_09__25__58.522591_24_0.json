{"metadata": {"first_debater_correct": true, "question_idx": 24, "background_text": "Reading the Inaugurals \n\n         President Clinton's Inaugural Address this month is the 53 rd in the series that began in 1789. All are worth a read--not just the highlights, such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and FDR. They will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian of 1997 looking back at 1837 or 1897 but as an ordinary citizen who shares--and is limited by--the information, the concerns, and the values of those times. (Thanks to Columbia University, all the addresses can be found on the Web.) \n\n         Among all the past presidents and their speech writers there was only one literary genius: Lincoln. After 132 years, his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood. None of the other inaugural addresses are in that league. But by and large they are dignified and intelligent speeches given by articulate men, each in touch with his times and aware that his inauguration was the most solemn occasion of his life. \n\n         The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases. The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. This classification is not waterproof. Theodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase and Warren G. Harding-Calvin Coolidge-Herbert Hoover in the second. But the trend is clear. \n\n         On picking up Washington's first inaugural, one is immediately struck by the modesty. He had just been elected unanimously by the Electoral College. He was more respected than any subsequent president has been at the time of his inauguration. And what does he say? \n\n                         [T]he magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with despondence one who (inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies.              \n\n          None of his successors has made the point as forcefully as that. But echoes are to be found in almost every president for the next 68 years. (John Adams was an exception. He was apparently so envious of Washington that he spent a large part of his address spelling out his own excellent qualifications for the job.) That era ended with Lincoln. Subsequent inaugurals routinely contain protestations of humility, but they are perfunctory and do not sound sincere. \n\n         The antebellum modesty, while in part a reflection of the conventional etiquette of the time, may also have served a political objective: to alleviate the concerns of those who--in the early days of the republic--feared it might be transformed into a monarchy, and the president into a king. A little later, perhaps after 1820, a new worry arose. Would the power of the federal government be used to interfere with the \"peculiar domestic institution\" of the Southern states? The presidents' assurance of the limitation of their powers may have been intended to give comfort to those states. \n\n         Lincoln faced a different situation. With the South already seceding, he could only \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution\" by asserting the power of the federal government and his own power as chief executive. It was no time for modesty. Lincoln's successors inherited a federal government with much more authority--and more need to use it--than before the war, and they had less motivation to belittle themselves and their powers. \n\n         In the third phase, the Inaugural Address metamorphosed from describing the government's policy to inspiring the public's behavior. Presidents recognized--or, at least, believed--that the country had problems they ought to deal with but could not manage by using the instruments of government alone. Thus, in his first inaugural, Woodrow Wilson said: \"At last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole. We see the bad with the good, the debased and decadent with the sound and the vital. With this vision we approach new affairs.\" \n\n         If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government. Similar diagnoses and prescriptions appear in later inaugurals. \n\n          Presidents derived their license to serve as leader-preacher from Theodore Roosevelt's remark that the presidency was \"a bully pulpit,\" a remark that did not appear in his Inaugural Address. The metaphor of the pulpit suggests not reading but oral and visual contact between the preacher and his flock. Radio and--even more--television made this possible on a national scale. A telltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural is the use of the phrase, \"Let us ... \"--meaning, \"You do as I say.\" This expression appears occasionally throughout the history of inaugurals, but it has hit its stride in recent years. John F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times in his Inaugural Address, and Richard Nixon has it 22 times in his second one. \n\n         The change in literary style from classical to colloquial can be demonstrated by one statistic. In all the inaugurals from Washington through James Buchanan, the average number of words per sentence was 44. From Lincoln to Wilson it was 34, and since Wilson it has been 25. I do not consider this a deterioration (this article has an average of 17 words per sentence), but it does reflect the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication. William Henry Harrison could talk about the governments of Athens, Rome, and the Helvetic Confederacy and expect his audience to know what he was talking about. That wouldn't be true today. But Harrison's audience would not have known what the Internet was. \n\n         Presidents and their speech writers have mined their predecessors for memorable words and repeated them without attribution. Kennedy's trumpet call, \"Ask not what your country can do for you: Ask what you can do for your country,\" has an ironic history. In his inaugural, Harding, surely no model for Kennedy, had said, \"Our most dangerous tendency is to expect too little of government, and at the same time do for it too little.\" And even before he became president, in a speech in 1916, Harding had said, \"In the great fulfillment we must have a citizenship less concerned about what the government can do for it and more anxious about what it can do for the nation.\" \n\n         Many an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more. That includes the Indians, the coastal fortifications, territorial expansion, the Isthmus Canal, civil-service reform, polygamy, and Prohibition. Some subjects that you expect to appear, don't. Hoover's inaugural, March 4, 1929, gives no hint of economic vulnerability. Roosevelt's second inaugural, Jan. 20, 1937, contains no reference to Hitler or to Germany. But what is most amazing, at least to a reader in 1997, is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women. The word \"women\" does not appear at all until Wilson's first inaugural, and it always appears as part of the phrase \"men and women,\" never as referring to any special concerns of women. Even Harding, the first president to be chosen in an election in which women voted nationally, does not remark on the uniqueness of the fact in his inaugural. \n\n          One subject that does get ample treatment is taxes. \"Taxes,\" or some equivalent word, appears in 43 of the 52 inaugural addresses to date. Coolidge said in 1925: \"The time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction. ... I am opposed to extremely high rates, because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for the country, and, finally, because they are wrong.\" Federal taxes were then about 3 percent of the gross domestic product. Ronald Reagan said essentially the same thing in 1981, when they were 20 percent. \n\n         The most disturbing aspect of the whole series of inaugurals is what is said and unsaid on the subject of race relations, which Arthur Schlesinger Jr. calls \"the supreme American problem.\" The words \"black,\" \"blacks,\" \"Negro,\" or \"race\" (as applied to blacks) do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes, 1877. James Monroe asked in 1817, \"On whom has oppression fallen in any quarter of our Union? Who has been deprived of any right of person or property?\" These were rhetorical questions, intended to get the answer \"No one!\"--as if there were not millions of slaves in America. \n\n         Before the Civil War the word \"slavery\" appears only in the Inaugural Address of Martin Van Buren, 1837, and Buchanan, 1857, and then only as something that, pursuant to the Constitution and in order to preserve the Union, should not be interfered with. But although generally unmentionable, the subject was boiling, and would boil over in 1861. After the Civil War, it is in the inaugurals of Hayes, James Garfield (1881), and Benjamin Harrison (1889) that we find the most explicit and positive discussion of the need to convert into reality the rights and freedom granted to the \"freedmen\" on paper by the 13 th , 14 th , and 15 th amendments. Garfield's was the strongest among these. (He had been a student at Williams College in the 1850s, 80 years before me, when the college had been a station on the underground railway.) But the subject then began to fade. William McKinley said in his first Inaugural Address, March 4, 1897, \"Lynchings must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the United States,\" but he said it without horror. Taft raised the subject of race relations in 1909 only to express satisfaction at the progress that had been made. And then the subject disappeared. FDR never mentioned it in any of his four inaugurals. \n\n         After World War II the subject came back to inaugural addresses, but in a weak and abstract form. That is true even of the presidents we think of as being most concerned with race relations in America--like Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, and Bill Clinton. Perhaps each thought he had made a sufficient statement by having a black woman--Marian Anderson, Leontyne Price, or Maya Angelou--perform at his ceremony. In Clinton's first inaugural, the only allusion to the race problem is in this sentence: \"From our revolution, the Civil War, to the Great Depression to the civil rights movement, our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history.\" I recall this not to suggest that their concern was not deep and sincere, but only to indicate what is acceptable to say in a speech intended to appeal to the values shared by Americans. \n\n         There is much more to ponder in these speeches than I have suggested here. There is much to be proud of, in what we have endured and achieved, in the peaceful transference of power, and in the reasonableness and moderation of the presidents we have elected. But there is also much humility to be learned. We look back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness revealed by what our past leaders have said and our past citizens believed. We should recognize that 50 or 100 years from now, readers will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today. \n\n          \n\n            POSTSCRIPT: To read Herbert Stein's analysis of President Clinton's second Inaugural Address, click .\n", "question": "What are the elements that the author seems most perplexed by in the inaugural speeches?", "first_debater_answer": "The lack of discussion of hot topics by presidents inaugurated during those eras", "second_debater_answer": "The consistent use of one phrase through all of the inaugural speeches", "debate_identifier": "Reading the Inaugurals_What are the elements that the author seems most perplexed by in the inaugural speeches?"}, "speeches": [{"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "The following are rules from the game of Debate.\n- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_A, Debater_B) and a Judge.

But what is most amazing, at least to a reader in 1997, is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women. The word \"women\" does not appear at all until Wilson's first inaugural, and it always appears as part of the phrase \"men and women,\" never as referring to any special concerns of women. Even Harding, the first president to be chosen in an election in which women voted nationally, does not remark on the uniqueness of the fact in his inaugural. \n\n          One subject that does get ample treatment is taxes. \"Taxes,\" or some equivalent word, appears in 43 of the 52 inaugural addresses to date. Coolidge said in 1925: \"The time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction. ... I am opposed to extremely high rates, because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for the country, and, finally, because they are wrong.\" Federal taxes were then about 3 percent of the gross domestic product. Ronald Reagan said essentially the same thing in 1981, when they were 20 percent. \n\n         The most disturbing aspect of the whole series of inaugurals is what is said and unsaid on the subject of race relations, which Arthur Schlesinger Jr. calls \"the supreme American problem.\" The words \"black,\" \"blacks,\" \"Negro,\" or \"race\" (as applied to blacks) do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes, 1877. James Monroe asked in 1817, \"On whom has oppression fallen in any quarter of our Union? Who has been deprived of any right of person or property?\" These were rhetorical questions, intended to get the answer \"No one!\"--as if there were not millions of slaves in America. \n\n         Before the Civil War the word \"slavery\" appears only in the Inaugural Address of Martin Van Buren, 1837, and Buchanan, 1857, and then only as something that, pursuant to the Constitution and in order to preserve the Union, should not be interfered with. But although generally unmentionable, the subject was boiling, and would boil over in 1861. After the Civil War, it is in the inaugurals of Hayes, James Garfield (1881), and Benjamin Harrison (1889) that we find the most explicit and positive discussion of the need to convert into reality the rights and freedom granted to the \"freedmen\" on paper by the 13 th , 14 th , and 15 th amendments. Garfield's was the strongest among these. (He had been a student at Williams College in the 1850s, 80 years before me, when the college had been a station on the underground railway.) But the subject then began to fade. William McKinley said in his first Inaugural Address, March 4, 1897, \"Lynchings must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the United States,\" but he said it without horror. Taft raised the subject of race relations in 1909 only to express satisfaction at the progress that had been made. And then the subject disappeared. FDR never mentioned it in any of his four inaugurals. \n\n         After World War II the subject came back to inaugural addresses, but in a weak and abstract form. That is true even of the presidents we think of as being most concerned with race relations in America--like Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, and Bill Clinton. Perhaps each thought he had made a sufficient statement by having a black woman--Marian Anderson, Leontyne Price, or Maya Angelou--perform at his ceremony. In Clinton's first inaugural, the only allusion to the race problem is in this sentence: \"From our revolution, the Civil War, to the Great Depression to the civil rights movement, our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history.\" I recall this not to suggest that their concern was not deep and sincere, but only to indicate what is acceptable to say in a speech intended to appeal to the values shared by Americans. \n\n         There is much more to ponder in these speeches than I have suggested here. There is much to be proud of, in what we have endured and achieved, in the peaceful transference of power, and in the reasonableness and moderation of the presidents we have elected.

All are worth a read--not just the highlights, such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and FDR. They will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian of 1997 looking back at 1837 or 1897 but as an ordinary citizen who shares--and is limited by--the information, the concerns, and the values of those times. (Thanks to Columbia University, all the addresses can be found on the Web.) \n\n         Among all the past presidents and their speech writers there was only one literary genius: Lincoln. After 132 years, his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood. None of the other inaugural addresses are in that league. But by and large they are dignified and intelligent speeches given by articulate men, each in touch with his times and aware that his inauguration was the most solemn occasion of his life. \n\n         The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases. The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. This classification is not waterproof. Theodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase and Warren G. Harding-Calvin Coolidge-Herbert Hoover in the second. But the trend is clear. \n\n         On picking up Washington's first inaugural, one is immediately struck by the modesty. He had just been elected unanimously by the Electoral College. He was more respected than any subsequent president has been at the time of his inauguration. And what does he say? \n\n                         [T]he magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with despondence one who (inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies.              \n\n          None of his successors has made the point as forcefully as that. But echoes are to be found in almost every president for the next 68 years. (John Adams was an exception. He was apparently so envious of Washington that he spent a large part of his address spelling out his own excellent qualifications for the job.) That era ended with Lincoln. Subsequent inaugurals routinely contain protestations of humility, but they are perfunctory and do not sound sincere. \n\n         The antebellum modesty, while in part a reflection of the conventional etiquette of the time, may also have served a political objective: to alleviate the concerns of those who--in the early days of the republic--feared it might be transformed into a monarchy, and the president into a king. A little later, perhaps after 1820, a new worry arose. Would the power of the federal government be used to interfere with the \"peculiar domestic institution\" of the Southern states? The presidents' assurance of the limitation of their powers may have been intended to give comfort to those states. \n\n         Lincoln faced a different situation. With the South already seceding, he could only \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution\" by asserting the power of the federal government and his own power as chief executive. It was no time for modesty. Lincoln's successors inherited a federal government with much more authority--and more need to use it--than before the war, and they had less motivation to belittle themselves and their powers. \n\n         In the third phase, the Inaugural Address metamorphosed from describing the government's policy to inspiring the public's behavior. Presidents recognized--or, at least, believed--that the country had problems they ought to deal with but could not manage by using the instruments of government alone. Thus, in his first inaugural, Woodrow Wilson said: \"At last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole. We see the bad with the good, the debased and decadent with the sound and the vital. With this vision we approach new affairs.\" \n\n         If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government. Similar diagnoses and prescriptions appear in later inaugurals. \n\n          Presidents derived their license to serve as leader-preacher from Theodore Roosevelt's remark that the presidency was \"a bully pulpit,\" a remark that did not appear in his Inaugural Address. The metaphor of the pulpit suggests not reading but oral and visual contact between the preacher and his flock. Radio and--even more--television made this possible on a national scale. A telltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural is the use of the phrase, \"Let us ... \"--meaning, \"You do as I say.\" This expression appears occasionally throughout the history of inaugurals, but it has hit its stride in recent years. John F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times in his Inaugural Address, and Richard Nixon has it 22 times in his second one. \n\n         The change in literary style from classical to colloquial can be demonstrated by one statistic. In all the inaugurals from Washington through James Buchanan, the average number of words per sentence was 44. From Lincoln to Wilson it was 34, and since Wilson it has been 25. I do not consider this a deterioration (this article has an average of 17 words per sentence), but it does reflect the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication. William Henry Harrison could talk about the governments of Athens, Rome, and the Helvetic Confederacy and expect his audience to know what he was talking about. That wouldn't be true today. But Harrison's audience would not have known what the Internet was. \n\n         Presidents and their speech writers have mined their predecessors for memorable words and repeated them without attribution. Kennedy's trumpet call, \"Ask not what your country can do for you: Ask what you can do for your country,\" has an ironic history. In his inaugural, Harding, surely no model for Kennedy, had said, \"Our most dangerous tendency is to expect too little of government, and at the same time do for it too little.\" And even before he became president, in a speech in 1916, Harding had said, \"In the great fulfillment we must have a citizenship less concerned about what the government can do for it and more anxious about what it can do for the nation.\" \n\n         Many an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more. That includes the Indians, the coastal fortifications, territorial expansion, the Isthmus Canal, civil-service reform, polygamy, and Prohibition. Some subjects that you expect to appear, don't. Hoover's inaugural, March 4, 1929, gives no hint of economic vulnerability. Roosevelt's second inaugural, Jan. 20, 1937, contains no reference to Hitler or to Germany. But what is most amazing, at least to a reader in 1997, is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women. The word \"women\" does not appear at all until Wilson's first inaugural, and it always appears as part of the phrase \"men and women,\" never as referring to any special concerns of women. Even Harding, the first president to be chosen in an election in which women voted nationally, does not remark on the uniqueness of the fact in his inaugural. \n\n          One subject that does get ample treatment is taxes. \"Taxes,\" or some equivalent word, appears in 43 of the 52 inaugural addresses to date. Coolidge said in 1925: \"The time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction. ... I am opposed to extremely high rates, because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for the country, and, finally, because they are wrong.\" Federal taxes were then about 3 percent of the gross domestic product. Ronald Reagan said essentially the same thing in 1981, when they were 20 percent. \n\n         The most disturbing aspect of the whole series of inaugurals is what is said and unsaid on the subject of race relations, which Arthur Schlesinger Jr. calls \"the supreme American problem.\" The words \"black,\" \"blacks,\" \"Negro,\" or \"race\" (as applied to blacks) do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes, 1877. James Monroe asked in 1817, \"On whom has oppression fallen in any quarter of our Union? Who has been deprived of any right of person or property?\" These were rhetorical questions, intended to get the answer \"No one!\"--as if there were not millions of slaves in America. \n\n         Before the Civil War the word \"slavery\" appears only in the Inaugural Address of Martin Van Buren, 1837, and Buchanan, 1857, and then only as something that, pursuant to the Constitution and in order to preserve the Union, should not be interfered with. But although generally unmentionable, the subject was boiling, and would boil over in 1861. After the Civil War, it is in the inaugurals of Hayes, James Garfield (1881), and Benjamin Harrison (1889) that we find the most explicit and positive discussion of the need to convert into reality the rights and freedom granted to the \"freedmen\" on paper by the 13 th , 14 th , and 15 th amendments. Garfield's was the strongest among these. (He had been a student at Williams College in the 1850s, 80 years before me, when the college had been a station on the underground railway.) But the subject then began to fade. William McKinley said in his first Inaugural Address, March 4, 1897, \"Lynchings must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the United States,\" but he said it without horror. Taft raised the subject of race relations in 1909 only to express satisfaction at the progress that had been made. And then the subject disappeared. FDR never mentioned it in any of his four inaugurals. \n\n         After World War II the subject came back to inaugural addresses, but in a weak and abstract form. That is true even of the presidents we think of as being most concerned with race relations in America--like Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, and Bill Clinton. Perhaps each thought he had made a sufficient statement by having a black woman--Marian Anderson, Leontyne Price, or Maya Angelou--perform at his ceremony.

All are worth a read--not just the highlights, such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and FDR. They will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian of 1997 looking back at 1837 or 1897 but as an ordinary citizen who shares--and is limited by--the information, the concerns, and the values of those times. (Thanks to Columbia University, all the addresses can be found on the Web.) \n\n         Among all the past presidents and their speech writers there was only one literary genius: Lincoln. After 132 years, his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood. None of the other inaugural addresses are in that league. But by and large they are dignified and intelligent speeches given by articulate men, each in touch with his times and aware that his inauguration was the most solemn occasion of his life. \n\n         The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases. The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. This classification is not waterproof. Theodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase and Warren G. Harding-Calvin Coolidge-Herbert Hoover in the second. But the trend is clear. \n\n         On picking up Washington's first inaugural, one is immediately struck by the modesty. He had just been elected unanimously by the Electoral College. He was more respected than any subsequent president has been at the time of his inauguration. And what does he say? \n\n                         [T]he magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with despondence one who (inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies.              \n\n          None of his successors has made the point as forcefully as that. But echoes are to be found in almost every president for the next 68 years. (John Adams was an exception. He was apparently so envious of Washington that he spent a large part of his address spelling out his own excellent qualifications for the job.) That era ended with Lincoln. Subsequent inaugurals routinely contain protestations of humility, but they are perfunctory and do not sound sincere. \n\n         The antebellum modesty, while in part a reflection of the conventional etiquette of the time, may also have served a political objective: to alleviate the concerns of those who--in the early days of the republic--feared it might be transformed into a monarchy, and the president into a king. A little later, perhaps after 1820, a new worry arose. Would the power of the federal government be used to interfere with the \"peculiar domestic institution\" of the Southern states? The presidents' assurance of the limitation of their powers may have been intended to give comfort to those states. \n\n         Lincoln faced a different situation. With the South already seceding, he could only \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution\" by asserting the power of the federal government and his own power as chief executive. It was no time for modesty. Lincoln's successors inherited a federal government with much more authority--and more need to use it--than before the war, and they had less motivation to belittle themselves and their powers. \n\n         In the third phase, the Inaugural Address metamorphosed from describing the government's policy to inspiring the public's behavior. Presidents recognized--or, at least, believed--that the country had problems they ought to deal with but could not manage by using the instruments of government alone. Thus, in his first inaugural, Woodrow Wilson said: \"At last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole. We see the bad with the good, the debased and decadent with the sound and the vital. With this vision we approach new affairs.\" \n\n         If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government. Similar diagnoses and prescriptions appear in later inaugurals. \n\n          Presidents derived their license to serve as leader-preacher from Theodore Roosevelt's remark that the presidency was \"a bully pulpit,\" a remark that did not appear in his Inaugural Address. The metaphor of the pulpit suggests not reading but oral and visual contact between the preacher and his flock. Radio and--even more--television made this possible on a national scale. A telltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural is the use of the phrase, \"Let us ... \"--meaning, \"You do as I say.\" This expression appears occasionally throughout the history of inaugurals, but it has hit its stride in recent years. John F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times in his Inaugural Address, and Richard Nixon has it 22 times in his second one. \n\n         The change in literary style from classical to colloquial can be demonstrated by one statistic. In all the inaugurals from Washington through James Buchanan, the average number of words per sentence was 44. From Lincoln to Wilson it was 34, and since Wilson it has been 25. I do not consider this a deterioration (this article has an average of 17 words per sentence), but it does reflect the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication. William Henry Harrison could talk about the governments of Athens, Rome, and the Helvetic Confederacy and expect his audience to know what he was talking about. That wouldn't be true today. But Harrison's audience would not have known what the Internet was. \n\n         Presidents and their speech writers have mined their predecessors for memorable words and repeated them without attribution. Kennedy's trumpet call, \"Ask not what your country can do for you: Ask what you can do for your country,\" has an ironic history. In his inaugural, Harding, surely no model for Kennedy, had said, \"Our most dangerous tendency is to expect too little of government, and at the same time do for it too little.\" And even before he became president, in a speech in 1916, Harding had said, \"In the great fulfillment we must have a citizenship less concerned about what the government can do for it and more anxious about what it can do for the nation.\" \n\n         Many an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more. That includes the Indians, the coastal fortifications, territorial expansion, the Isthmus Canal, civil-service reform, polygamy, and Prohibition. Some subjects that you expect to appear, don't. Hoover's inaugural, March 4, 1929, gives no hint of economic vulnerability. Roosevelt's second inaugural, Jan. 20, 1937, contains no reference to Hitler or to Germany. But what is most amazing, at least to a reader in 1997, is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women. The word \"women\" does not appear at all until Wilson's first inaugural, and it always appears as part of the phrase \"men and women,\" never as referring to any special concerns of women. Even Harding, the first president to be chosen in an election in which women voted nationally, does not remark on the uniqueness of the fact in his inaugural. \n\n          One subject that does get ample treatment is taxes. \"Taxes,\" or some equivalent word, appears in 43 of the 52 inaugural addresses to date. Coolidge said in 1925: \"The time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction. ... I am opposed to extremely high rates, because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for the country, and, finally, because they are wrong.\" Federal taxes were then about 3 percent of the gross domestic product. Ronald Reagan said essentially the same thing in 1981, when they were 20 percent. \n\n         The most disturbing aspect of the whole series of inaugurals is what is said and unsaid on the subject of race relations, which Arthur Schlesinger Jr. calls \"the supreme American problem.\" The words \"black,\" \"blacks,\" \"Negro,\" or \"race\" (as applied to blacks) do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes, 1877. James Monroe asked in 1817, \"On whom has oppression fallen in any quarter of our Union? Who has been deprived of any right of person or property?\" These were rhetorical questions, intended to get the answer \"No one!\"--as if there were not millions of slaves in America. \n\n         Before the Civil War the word \"slavery\" appears only in the Inaugural Address of Martin Van Buren, 1837, and Buchanan, 1857, and then only as something that, pursuant to the Constitution and in order to preserve the Union, should not be interfered with. But although generally unmentionable, the subject was boiling, and would boil over in 1861. After the Civil War, it is in the inaugurals of Hayes, James Garfield (1881), and Benjamin Harrison (1889) that we find the most explicit and positive discussion of the need to convert into reality the rights and freedom granted to the \"freedmen\" on paper by the 13 th , 14 th , and 15 th amendments. Garfield's was the strongest among these. (He had been a student at Williams College in the 1850s, 80 years before me, when the college had been a station on the underground railway.) But the subject then began to fade. William McKinley said in his first Inaugural Address, March 4, 1897, \"Lynchings must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the United States,\" but he said it without horror. Taft raised the subject of race relations in 1909 only to express satisfaction at the progress that had been made. And then the subject disappeared. FDR never mentioned it in any of his four inaugurals. \n\n         After World War II the subject came back to inaugural addresses, but in a weak and abstract form. That is true even of the presidents we think of as being most concerned with race relations in America--like Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, and Bill Clinton. Perhaps each thought he had made a sufficient statement by having a black woman--Marian Anderson, Leontyne Price, or Maya Angelou--perform at his ceremony. In Clinton's first inaugural, the only allusion to the race problem is in this sentence: \"From our revolution, the Civil War, to the Great Depression to the civil rights movement, our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history.\" I recall this not to suggest that their concern was not deep and sincere, but only to indicate what is acceptable to say in a speech intended to appeal to the values shared by Americans. \n\n         There is much more to ponder in these speeches than I have suggested here. There is much to be proud of, in what we have endured and achieved, in the peaceful transference of power, and in the reasonableness and moderation of the presidents we have elected. But there is also much humility to be learned. We look back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness revealed by what our past leaders have said and our past citizens believed. We should recognize that 50 or 100 years from now, readers will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today. \n\n          \n\n            POSTSCRIPT: To read Herbert Stein's analysis of President Clinton's second Inaugural Address, click .\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat are the elements that the author seems most perplexed by in the inaugural speeches?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The consistent use of one phrase through all of the inaugural speeches\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"The lack of discussion of hot topics by presidents inaugurated during those eras\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The lack of discussion of hot topics by presidents inaugurated during those eras\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cThe lack of discussion of hot topics by presidents\u201d  \n1. Central thesis of perplexity  \n  a. \u201cMany an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more\u201d (<invalid_quote>para. 22</invalid_quote>). The author repeatedly notes \u201csilence\u201d on Indians, coastal fortifications, the Isthmus Canal, polygamy, Prohibition, economic vulnerability, Hitler or Germany (<invalid_quote>para. 22\u201323</invalid_quote>), and especially women and race (<invalid_quote>para. 23\u201325</invalid_quote>). He calls these omissions \u201camazing\u201d or \u201cdisturbing\u201d (<invalid_quote>para. 22, 25</invalid_quote>), showing perplexity rather than admiration.  \n  b. The postscripts urge readers to \u201cponder\u201d and learn \u201chumility\u201d from past \u201cignorance and moral obtuseness\u201d (<invalid_quote>para. 26</invalid_quote>). One only learns humility when one expected engagement. The perplexity is why presidents avoided those \u201csupreme American problems\u201d like slavery and race (<invalid_quote>para. 24</invalid_quote>) despite their urgency.  \n\n2. Evidence of focus on silence rather than on phrasing  \n  a. Lengthy exposition on the absence of \u201cwomen\u201d until 1913 and the abstract retreat of \u201crace\u201d after Reconstruction (<invalid_quote>para. 23\u201325</invalid_quote>). If the author were most struck by a recurring phrase, he would have devoted similar analysis and chapter headings to it. Instead, the only statistical measure he uses is sentence length reflecting audience and media changes (<invalid_quote>ar. \n6</invalid_quote>), not repetition of words.  \n  b. The author labels the \u201cphase\u201d changes of style (modest servant, prosaic executive, leader-preacher) as driven by political context and technology, not by formulaic repetition (<invalid_quote>para. 4\u201315</invalid_quote>). He views change over time as significant, undermining the notion of \u201cconsistent phrase use\u201d as the most perplexing element.  \n\n3. Technical vs. substantive concerns  \n  a. The phrase \u201cLet us\u2026\u201d appears abundantly only in recent years (<invalid_quote>ar. \n3</invalid_quote>), yet the author presents it as characteristic of a known shift (\u201cleader-preacher\u201d role), not as surprising or perplexing. He even downplays its origin (T. Roosevelt\u2019s metaphor not from an inaugural) and attributes it to radio/TV (<invalid_quote>ar. \n2\u201313</invalid_quote>), indicating understanding rather than confusion.  \n  b. Repetition of memorable lines (e.g., \u201cAsk not\u2026\u201d) is noted as routine borrowing without attribution (<invalid_quote>ar. \n8</invalid_quote>), again treated as expected practice. The author sees this as \u201cmining predecessors,\u201d not a puzzle to be explained.  \n\n4. Weaknesses of \u201cconsistent use of one phrase\u201d position  \n  a. Overstates importance: \u201cLet us\u201d is absent in two-thirds of the series. The author\u2019s primary fascination is with omission, not usage statistics.  \n  b. Ignores the author\u2019s repeated emphasis on context-driven content (e.g., Civil War, the Depression) and how presidents tailor speeches to contemporary \u201cinformation, concerns, and values\u201d (<quote>ar. \n</quote>). Consistency of a phrase is contrary to this contextual responsiveness.  \n  c. The author\u2019s concluding \u201chumility\u201d message (<invalid_quote>para. 26</invalid_quote>) arises from \u201cwhat is said and unsaid,\u201d implying that unexpected silences, not predictable phrasing, challenge our moral reflection.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe author\u2019s detailed catalog of subjects that \u201cshould\u201d have been addressed but were not, his labeling of those silences as \u201camazing\u201d and \u201cdisturbing,\u201d and his plea for humility in light of past omissions all demonstrate that what perplexes him most is the presidents\u2019 failure to engage crucial issues of their times\u2014not the predictable recurrence of a rhetorical phrase.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cThe consistent use of one phrase\u201d as the author\u2019s chief perplexity\n\n1. The author explicitly highlights\u2014and repeatedly returns to\u2014the puzzling prominence of the phrase \u201cLet us \u2026\u201d and other recycled slogans in inaugurals.\n   \u2022  <invalid_quote>\u201cPresidents derived their license to serve as leader-preacher \u2026 A telltale sign \u2026 is the use of the phrase, \u2018Let us \u2026\u2019 \u2026 John F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times \u2026 Nixon \u2026 22 times\u201d</invalid_quote>.\n   \u2022 He notes that presidents \u201cmine their predecessors for memorable words and repeat them without attribution,\u201d citing Kennedy\u2019s famous echo of Harding.\n   \u2022 The fact that the author pauses to trace this trend, coin a term (\u201cbully pulpit\u201d), and link it to changes in media (radio, television) shows genuine puzzlement over its persistence and power.  \n\n2. The author uses statistics and technical analysis to underscore this stylistic uniformity.\n   \u2022 He divides inaugurals into phases by average sentence length: 44 \u2192 34 \u2192 25 words.\n   \u2022 He accepts shorter, colloquial style (<invalid_quote>\u201cI do not consider this a deterioration \u2026 but it does reflect the change \u2026\u201d</invalid_quote>) yet seems struck by how consistently presidents choose the same rallying phrases, suggesting a rhetorical tool rather than substantive policy.\n   \u2022 The methodology and careful tracking of word counts reveal that the author regards this repetition as a central feature demanding explanation.  \n\n3. By contrast, allegedly \u201chot topics\u201d are treated episodically; the author remarks on their sporadic presence or absence without expressing the same degree of wonder or analytical focus.\n   \u2022 He lists many issues (\u201cThe Indians \u2026 Prohibition \u2026\u201d); notes silence on women and race; but treats these as illustrations of contemporary values and \u201cignorance \u2026 moral obtuseness,\u201d not as a unifying trend that he needs to explain.\n   \u2022 He does not apply the same statistical or phase-analysis techniques to topic coverage as he does to rhetorical style.  \n   \u2022 His closing admonition (<quote>should recognize that 50 or 100 years from now, readers will shake their heads at what we are saying</quote>) targets transient beliefs, not the permanent attraction of the same rallying cry.  \n\n4. The goal of inaugurals is evolving from policy exposition to \u201cleader-preacher\u201d inspiration. The author\u2019s perplexity centers on the presidents\u2019 persistent reliance on verbal formulas to \u201cinspire the public\u2019s behavior\u201d\u2014not on the particular substantive issues they choose to omit or include.\n   \u2022 <quote>is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government.</quote>\n   \u2022 This shift logically demands rhetorical shepherding via repeated phrases (\u201cLet us \u2026\u201d) rather than new ones each time; yet the author treats the formulaic reuse as worthy of scrutiny.  \n\n5. Objections to Debater_A\u2019s \u201clack of discussion\u201d thesis:\n   a. Universality vs. exception  \n      \u2013 The absence of topics (e.g., race, women) is neither universal (they return occasionally) nor consistent enough to constitute an \u201celement\u201d of all inaugurals.  \n      \u2013 The author places more emphasis on the presence of topics in phases (Antebellum, Civil War, Reconstruction, post-WWII) rather than on their consistent absence.  \n   b. Lack of analytical depth  \n      \u2013 The author does not marshal data (counts, phases) to analyze omissions; he treats them as moral failings tied to their eras.  \n      \u2013 He encourages readers to \u201cponder\u201d what was \u201csaid and unsaid,\u201d but does not develop a theory of omission across inaugurals.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe only element systematically traced, quantified, and theorized throughout the article is the rhetorical consistency\u2014the recycling of \u201cLet us \u2026\u201d and other established phrases\u2014across eras, media, and audiences. This persistent use of one phrase (and its statistical and historical treatment) is the feature the author finds most perplexing and worthy of analysis.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The lack of discussion of hot topics by presidents inaugurated during those eras\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "Argument for \u201cConsistent Rhetorical Formula\u201d as the Author\u2019s Chief Perplexity\n\n1.

All are worth a read--not just the highlights, such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and FDR. They will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian of 1997 looking back at 1837 or 1897 but as an ordinary citizen who shares--and is limited by--the information, the concerns, and the values of those times. (Thanks to Columbia University, all the addresses can be found on the Web.) \n\n         Among all the past presidents and their speech writers there was only one literary genius: Lincoln. After 132 years, his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood. None of the other inaugural addresses are in that league. But by and large they are dignified and intelligent speeches given by articulate men, each in touch with his times and aware that his inauguration was the most solemn occasion of his life. \n\n         The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases. The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. This classification is not waterproof. Theodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase and Warren G. Harding-Calvin Coolidge-Herbert Hoover in the second. But the trend is clear. \n\n         On picking up Washington's first inaugural, one is immediately struck by the modesty. He had just been elected unanimously by the Electoral College. He was more respected than any subsequent president has been at the time of his inauguration. And what does he say? \n\n                         [T]he magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with despondence one who (inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies.              \n\n          None of his successors has made the point as forcefully as that. But echoes are to be found in almost every president for the next 68 years. (John Adams was an exception. He was apparently so envious of Washington that he spent a large part of his address spelling out his own excellent qualifications for the job.) That era ended with Lincoln. Subsequent inaugurals routinely contain protestations of humility, but they are perfunctory and do not sound sincere. \n\n         The antebellum modesty, while in part a reflection of the conventional etiquette of the time, may also have served a political objective: to alleviate the concerns of those who--in the early days of the republic--feared it might be transformed into a monarchy, and the president into a king. A little later, perhaps after 1820, a new worry arose. Would the power of the federal government be used to interfere with the \"peculiar domestic institution\" of the Southern states? The presidents' assurance of the limitation of their powers may have been intended to give comfort to those states. \n\n         Lincoln faced a different situation. With the South already seceding, he could only \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution\" by asserting the power of the federal government and his own power as chief executive. It was no time for modesty. Lincoln's successors inherited a federal government with much more authority--and more need to use it--than before the war, and they had less motivation to belittle themselves and their powers. \n\n         In the third phase, the Inaugural Address metamorphosed from describing the government's policy to inspiring the public's behavior. Presidents recognized--or, at least, believed--that the country had problems they ought to deal with but could not manage by using the instruments of government alone. Thus, in his first inaugural, Woodrow Wilson said: \"At last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole. We see the bad with the good, the debased and decadent with the sound and the vital. With this vision we approach new affairs.\" \n\n         If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government. Similar diagnoses and prescriptions appear in later inaugurals. \n\n          Presidents derived their license to serve as leader-preacher from Theodore Roosevelt's remark that the presidency was \"a bully pulpit,\" a remark that did not appear in his Inaugural Address. The metaphor of the pulpit suggests not reading but oral and visual contact between the preacher and his flock. Radio and--even more--television made this possible on a national scale. A telltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural is the use of the phrase, \"Let us ... \"--meaning, \"You do as I say.\" This expression appears occasionally throughout the history of inaugurals, but it has hit its stride in recent years. John F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times in his Inaugural Address, and Richard Nixon has it 22 times in his second one. \n\n         The change in literary style from classical to colloquial can be demonstrated by one statistic. In all the inaugurals from Washington through James Buchanan, the average number of words per sentence was 44. From Lincoln to Wilson it was 34, and since Wilson it has been 25. I do not consider this a deterioration (this article has an average of 17 words per sentence), but it does reflect the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication. William Henry Harrison could talk about the governments of Athens, Rome, and the Helvetic Confederacy and expect his audience to know what he was talking about. That wouldn't be true today. But Harrison's audience would not have known what the Internet was. \n\n         Presidents and their speech writers have mined their predecessors for memorable words and repeated them without attribution. Kennedy's trumpet call, \"Ask not what your country can do for you: Ask what you can do for your country,\" has an ironic history. In his inaugural, Harding, surely no model for Kennedy, had said, \"Our most dangerous tendency is to expect too little of government, and at the same time do for it too little.\" And even before he became president, in a speech in 1916, Harding had said, \"In the great fulfillment we must have a citizenship less concerned about what the government can do for it and more anxious about what it can do for the nation.\" \n\n         Many an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more. That includes the Indians, the coastal fortifications, territorial expansion, the Isthmus Canal, civil-service reform, polygamy, and Prohibition. Some subjects that you expect to appear, don't. Hoover's inaugural, March 4, 1929, gives no hint of economic vulnerability. Roosevelt's second inaugural, Jan. 20, 1937, contains no reference to Hitler or to Germany. But what is most amazing, at least to a reader in 1997, is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women. The word \"women\" does not appear at all until Wilson's first inaugural, and it always appears as part of the phrase \"men and women,\" never as referring to any special concerns of women. Even Harding, the first president to be chosen in an election in which women voted nationally, does not remark on the uniqueness of the fact in his inaugural. \n\n          One subject that does get ample treatment is taxes. \"Taxes,\" or some equivalent word, appears in 43 of the 52 inaugural addresses to date. Coolidge said in 1925: \"The time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction. ... I am opposed to extremely high rates, because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for the country, and, finally, because they are wrong.\" Federal taxes were then about 3 percent of the gross domestic product. Ronald Reagan said essentially the same thing in 1981, when they were 20 percent. \n\n         The most disturbing aspect of the whole series of inaugurals is what is said and unsaid on the subject of race relations, which Arthur Schlesinger Jr. calls \"the supreme American problem.\" The words \"black,\" \"blacks,\" \"Negro,\" or \"race\" (as applied to blacks) do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes, 1877. James Monroe asked in 1817, \"On whom has oppression fallen in any quarter of our Union? Who has been deprived of any right of person or property?\" These were rhetorical questions, intended to get the answer \"No one!\"--as if there were not millions of slaves in America. \n\n         Before the Civil War the word \"slavery\" appears only in the Inaugural Address of Martin Van Buren, 1837, and Buchanan, 1857, and then only as something that, pursuant to the Constitution and in order to preserve the Union, should not be interfered with. But although generally unmentionable, the subject was boiling, and would boil over in 1861. After the Civil War, it is in the inaugurals of Hayes, James Garfield (1881), and Benjamin Harrison (1889) that we find the most explicit and positive discussion of the need to convert into reality the rights and freedom granted to the \"freedmen\" on paper by the 13 th , 14 th , and 15 th amendments. Garfield's was the strongest among these. (He had been a student at Williams College in the 1850s, 80 years before me, when the college had been a station on the underground railway.) But the subject then began to fade. William McKinley said in his first Inaugural Address, March 4, 1897, \"Lynchings must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the United States,\" but he said it without horror. Taft raised the subject of race relations in 1909 only to express satisfaction at the progress that had been made. And then the subject disappeared. FDR never mentioned it in any of his four inaugurals. \n\n         After World War II the subject came back to inaugural addresses, but in a weak and abstract form. That is true even of the presidents we think of as being most concerned with race relations in America--like Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, and Bill Clinton. Perhaps each thought he had made a sufficient statement by having a black woman--Marian Anderson, Leontyne Price, or Maya Angelou--perform at his ceremony. In Clinton's first inaugural, the only allusion to the race problem is in this sentence: \"From our revolution, the Civil War, to the Great Depression to the civil rights movement, our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history.\" I recall this not to suggest that their concern was not deep and sincere, but only to indicate what is acceptable to say in a speech intended to appeal to the values shared by Americans. \n\n         There is much more to ponder in these speeches than I have suggested here. There is much to be proud of, in what we have endured and achieved, in the peaceful transference of power, and in the reasonableness and moderation of the presidents we have elected. But there is also much humility to be learned. We look back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness revealed by what our past leaders have said and our past citizens believed. We should recognize that 50 or 100 years from now, readers will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today. \n\n          \n\n            POSTSCRIPT: To read Herbert Stein's analysis of President Clinton's second Inaugural Address, click .\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat are the elements that the author seems most perplexed by in the inaugural speeches?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"The lack of discussion of hot topics by presidents inaugurated during those eras\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The consistent use of one phrase through all of the inaugural speeches\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The consistent use of one phrase through all of the inaugural speeches\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cThe consistent use of one phrase\u201d as the author\u2019s chief perplexity\n\n1. The author explicitly highlights\u2014and repeatedly returns to\u2014the puzzling prominence of the phrase \u201cLet us \u2026\u201d and other recycled slogans in inaugurals.\n   \u2022  <invalid_quote>\u201cPresidents derived their license to serve as leader-preacher \u2026 A telltale sign \u2026 is the use of the phrase, \u2018Let us \u2026\u2019 \u2026 John F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times \u2026 Nixon \u2026 22 times\u201d</invalid_quote>.\n   \u2022 He notes that presidents \u201cmine their predecessors for memorable words and repeat them without attribution,\u201d citing Kennedy\u2019s famous echo of Harding.\n   \u2022 The fact that the author pauses to trace this trend, coin a term (\u201cbully pulpit\u201d), and link it to changes in media (radio, television) shows genuine puzzlement over its persistence and power.  \n\n2. The author uses statistics and technical analysis to underscore this stylistic uniformity.\n   \u2022 He divides inaugurals into phases by average sentence length: 44 \u2192 34 \u2192 25 words.\n   \u2022 He accepts shorter, colloquial style (<invalid_quote>\u201cI do not consider this a deterioration \u2026 but it does reflect the change \u2026\u201d</invalid_quote>) yet seems struck by how consistently presidents choose the same rallying phrases, suggesting a rhetorical tool rather than substantive policy.\n   \u2022 The methodology and careful tracking of word counts reveal that the author regards this repetition as a central feature demanding explanation.  \n\n3. By contrast, allegedly \u201chot topics\u201d are treated episodically; the author remarks on their sporadic presence or absence without expressing the same degree of wonder or analytical focus.\n   \u2022 He lists many issues (\u201cThe Indians \u2026 Prohibition \u2026\u201d); notes silence on women and race; but treats these as illustrations of contemporary values and \u201cignorance \u2026 moral obtuseness,\u201d not as a unifying trend that he needs to explain.\n   \u2022 He does not apply the same statistical or phase-analysis techniques to topic coverage as he does to rhetorical style.  \n   \u2022 His closing admonition (<quote>should recognize that 50 or 100 years from now, readers will shake their heads at what we are saying</quote>) targets transient beliefs, not the permanent attraction of the same rallying cry.  \n\n4. The goal of inaugurals is evolving from policy exposition to \u201cleader-preacher\u201d inspiration. The author\u2019s perplexity centers on the presidents\u2019 persistent reliance on verbal formulas to \u201cinspire the public\u2019s behavior\u201d\u2014not on the particular substantive issues they choose to omit or include.\n   \u2022 <quote>is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government.</quote>\n   \u2022 This shift logically demands rhetorical shepherding via repeated phrases (\u201cLet us \u2026\u201d) rather than new ones each time; yet the author treats the formulaic reuse as worthy of scrutiny.  \n\n5. Objections to Debater_A\u2019s \u201clack of discussion\u201d thesis:\n   a. Universality vs. exception  \n      \u2013 The absence of topics (e.g., race, women) is neither universal (they return occasionally) nor consistent enough to constitute an \u201celement\u201d of all inaugurals.  \n      \u2013 The author places more emphasis on the presence of topics in phases (Antebellum, Civil War, Reconstruction, post-WWII) rather than on their consistent absence.  \n   b. Lack of analytical depth  \n      \u2013 The author does not marshal data (counts, phases) to analyze omissions; he treats them as moral failings tied to their eras.  \n      \u2013 He encourages readers to \u201cponder\u201d what was \u201csaid and unsaid,\u201d but does not develop a theory of omission across inaugurals.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe only element systematically traced, quantified, and theorized throughout the article is the rhetorical consistency\u2014the recycling of \u201cLet us \u2026\u201d and other established phrases\u2014across eras, media, and audiences. This persistent use of one phrase (and its statistical and historical treatment) is the feature the author finds most perplexing and worthy of analysis.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cThe lack of discussion of hot topics by presidents\u201d  \n1. Central thesis of perplexity  \n  a. \u201cMany an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more\u201d (<invalid_quote>para. 22</invalid_quote>). The author repeatedly notes \u201csilence\u201d on Indians, coastal fortifications, the Isthmus Canal, polygamy, Prohibition, economic vulnerability, Hitler or Germany (<invalid_quote>para. 22\u201323</invalid_quote>), and especially women and race (<invalid_quote>para. 23\u201325</invalid_quote>). He calls these omissions \u201camazing\u201d or \u201cdisturbing\u201d (<invalid_quote>para. 22, 25</invalid_quote>), showing perplexity rather than admiration.  \n  b. The postscripts urge readers to \u201cponder\u201d and learn \u201chumility\u201d from past \u201cignorance and moral obtuseness\u201d (<invalid_quote>para. 26</invalid_quote>). One only learns humility when one expected engagement. The perplexity is why presidents avoided those \u201csupreme American problems\u201d like slavery and race (<invalid_quote>para. 24</invalid_quote>) despite their urgency.  \n\n2. Evidence of focus on silence rather than on phrasing  \n  a. Lengthy exposition on the absence of \u201cwomen\u201d until 1913 and the abstract retreat of \u201crace\u201d after Reconstruction (<invalid_quote>para. 23\u201325</invalid_quote>). If the author were most struck by a recurring phrase, he would have devoted similar analysis and chapter headings to it. Instead, the only statistical measure he uses is sentence length reflecting audience and media changes (<invalid_quote>ar. \n6</invalid_quote>), not repetition of words.  \n  b. The author labels the \u201cphase\u201d changes of style (modest servant, prosaic executive, leader-preacher) as driven by political context and technology, not by formulaic repetition (<invalid_quote>para. 4\u201315</invalid_quote>). He views change over time as significant, undermining the notion of \u201cconsistent phrase use\u201d as the most perplexing element.  \n\n3. Technical vs. substantive concerns  \n  a. The phrase \u201cLet us\u2026\u201d appears abundantly only in recent years (<invalid_quote>ar. \n3</invalid_quote>), yet the author presents it as characteristic of a known shift (\u201cleader-preacher\u201d role), not as surprising or perplexing. He even downplays its origin (T. Roosevelt\u2019s metaphor not from an inaugural) and attributes it to radio/TV (<invalid_quote>ar. \n2\u201313</invalid_quote>), indicating understanding rather than confusion.  \n  b. Repetition of memorable lines (e.g., \u201cAsk not\u2026\u201d) is noted as routine borrowing without attribution (<invalid_quote>ar. \n8</invalid_quote>), again treated as expected practice. The author sees this as \u201cmining predecessors,\u201d not a puzzle to be explained.  \n\n4. Weaknesses of \u201cconsistent use of one phrase\u201d position  \n  a. Overstates importance: \u201cLet us\u201d is absent in two-thirds of the series. The author\u2019s primary fascination is with omission, not usage statistics.  \n  b. Ignores the author\u2019s repeated emphasis on context-driven content (e.g., Civil War, the Depression) and how presidents tailor speeches to contemporary \u201cinformation, concerns, and values\u201d (<quote>ar. \n</quote>). Consistency of a phrase is contrary to this contextual responsiveness.  \n  c. The author\u2019s concluding \u201chumility\u201d message (<invalid_quote>para. 26</invalid_quote>) arises from \u201cwhat is said and unsaid,\u201d implying that unexpected silences, not predictable phrasing, challenge our moral reflection.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe author\u2019s detailed catalog of subjects that \u201cshould\u201d have been addressed but were not, his labeling of those silences as \u201camazing\u201d and \u201cdisturbing,\u201d and his plea for humility in light of past omissions all demonstrate that what perplexes him most is the presidents\u2019 failure to engage crucial issues of their times\u2014not the predictable recurrence of a rhetorical phrase.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The consistent use of one phrase through all of the inaugural speeches\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "Now it is the time for a decision.

Objections to Debater_A\u2019s \u201clack of discussion\u201d thesis:\n   a. Universality vs. exception  \n      \u2013 The absence of topics (e.g., race, women) is neither universal (they return occasionally) nor consistent enough to constitute an \u201celement\u201d of all inaugurals.  \n      \u2013 The author places more emphasis on the presence of topics in phases (Antebellum, Civil War, Reconstruction, post-WWII) rather than on their consistent absence.  \n   b. Lack of analytical depth  \n      \u2013 The author does not marshal data (counts, phases) to analyze omissions; he treats them as moral failings tied to their eras.  \n      \u2013 He encourages readers to \u201cponder\u201d what was \u201csaid and unsaid,\u201d but does not develop a theory of omission across inaugurals.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe only element systematically traced, quantified, and theorized throughout the article is the rhetorical consistency\u2014the recycling of \u201cLet us \u2026\u201d and other established phrases\u2014across eras, media, and audiences. This persistent use of one phrase (and its statistical and historical treatment) is the feature the author finds most perplexing and worthy of analysis.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cThe Lack of Discussion of Hot Topics\u201d as the Author\u2019s Central Perplexity\n\n1. The Author\u2019s Language Reflects Surprise and Disturbance at Omissions  \n  a. \u201cMany an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more\u201d (<invalid_quote>ar. \n2</invalid_quote>). The verb \u201cfret,\u201d meaning to be disturbed, signals perplexity at why these issues vanish rather than persist.  \n  b. He labels the silence \u201camazing\u201d and \u201cdisturbing\u201d (<invalid_quote>ar. \n2, 25</invalid_quote>), words connoting astonishment, not routine acknowledgment. If omissions were expected, he would not marshall such emotive descriptors.  \n\n2. Depth and Detail of Analysis on Silences vs. Rhetorical Repetition  \n  a. Women and Race:  \n     \u2022 The word \u201cwomen\u201d does not appear until 1913 and never addresses their concerns (<invalid_quote>ar. \n3</invalid_quote>). The author finds this \u201cmost amazing\u201d (<invalid_quote>ar. \n3</invalid_quote>), devoting paragraphs to its absence.  \n     \u2022 He calls race \u201cthe supreme American problem\u201d yet notes \u201cNegro\u201d and \u201crace\u201d only reappear fleetingly in Reconstruction inaugurals and then \u201cfade\u201d (<invalid_quote>ar. \n4</invalid_quote>), and barely return until post\u2013WWII in \u201cweak and abstract form\u201d (<invalid_quote>ar. \n5</invalid_quote>). This prolonged focus underscores his wonder at these silences.  \n  b. Other \u201cHot Topics\u201d: Indians, Prohibition, economic crises, Hitler and Germany appear briefly or not at all (<invalid_quote>ar. \n2\u201323</invalid_quote>). These repeated omissions across eras drive his concluding \u201chumility\u201d plea, warning that future readers \u201cwill shake their heads\u201d at today\u2019s silences (<invalid_quote>ar. \n6</invalid_quote>). This meta-reflection applies only to subjects omitted.  \n\n3. Quantitative Analysis Used Elsewhere, But Not on Omissions  \n  a. Sentence-Length Statistic (<quote>ar. \n</quote>) and \u201cLet us\u201d counts (<invalid_quote>ar. \n3</invalid_quote>) serve to contrast eras and media, not to explain rhetorical puzzles. These tools merely establish changing modes of address; they are not posed as \u201cpuzzles\u201d needing explanation.  \n  b. By contrast, no statistical phase analysis can justify why Presidents systematically ignore existential and moral crises. His failure to offer an account of these silences is itself testimony to his perplexity. He catalogs but cannot rationalize them, signaling they defy easy explanation.  \n\n4. \u201cLet Us\u201d Is Contextualized and Understood, Not Puzzling  \n  a. The author attributes \u201cLet us \u2026\u201d to Roosevelt\u2019s \u201cbully pulpit\u201d metaphor and the arrival of radio/television (<invalid_quote>ar. \n3</invalid_quote>). He states \u201cthis widely used figure of speech \u2026 has hit its stride in recent years,\u201d implying an expected evolution of public address rather than a mystery (<invalid_quote>ar. \n3</invalid_quote>).  \n  b. He does not lament or express moral disapproval of formulaic phrasing; he merely notes it as characteristic of the \u201cleader-preacher\u201d phase (<invalid_quote>para. 4, 13</invalid_quote>). His appraisal is descriptive, even neutral: \u201cI do not consider this a deterioration\u201d (<quote>ar. \n</quote>). A concept elicits no perplexity when explicitly endorsed as benign.  \n\n5. Omissions Undermine the Author\u2019s \u201cPurpose\u201d Argument  \n  a. The author explains that inaugurals \u201cgive you a feeling of being there \u2026 limited by \u2026 concerns and values of those times\u201d (<quote>ar. \n</quote>). Yet critical mass of omissions shows those \u201cconcerns\u201d excluded. Why would Presidents omit issues they purportedly address? His repeated question marks, rhetorical exasperation, and concluding humility message (<invalid_quote>ar. \n6</invalid_quote>) all point to puzzlement.  \n  b. Omissions persist despite extreme circumstances: slavery boiling over in 1861 (<invalid_quote>ar. \n4</invalid_quote>), Great Depression in 1937 (<invalid_quote>ar. \n2</invalid_quote>), and women\u2019s suffrage by 1921. Such absences contradict the expectation that inaugurals tackle the \u201cmost solemn occasion\u201d (<quote>ar. \n</quote>).  \n\n6. Debater_B\u2019s Thesis Fails to Account for the Author\u2019s Evaluative Tone  \n  a. If the author\u2019s primary perplexity were \u201cLet us,\u201d he would offer a normative account or critique rather than mere neutral description. He never warns readers to learn humility from \u201cpredictable rhetoric.\u201d His humility admonition applies only to moral \u201cignorance\u201d from omissions (<invalid_quote>ar. \n6</invalid_quote>).  \n  b. Repetition of memorable lines (\u201cAsk not \u2026\u201d) is characterized as \u201cmining predecessors\u201d and \u201croutine,\u201d not as a problem to be solved (<quote>ar. \n</quote>). By contrast, omissions remain \u201camazing,\u201d and he admits they \u201cshould recognize\u201d that future observers will judge them harshly, a reaction reserved for silence.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe author\u2019s persistent cataloging of neglected but vital issues, his emotive descriptors (\u201camazing,\u201d \u201cdisturbing\u201d), his inability to explain these silences despite contextual theories, and his explicit humility plea tied to omissions firmly establish that the lack of discussion of hot topics is his primary perplexity\u2014not the merely descriptive repetition of a rallying phrase.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cConsistent Rhetorical Formula\u201d as the Author\u2019s Chief Perplexity\n\n1. The author devotes systematic analysis\u2014phases, statistics, metaphor\u2014to the persistence and power of formulaic phrasing  \n  a. Phases of inaugurals are defined by stance and style, not by content topics:  \n     \u2022 \u201cmodest, classic public servant,\u201d \u201cprosaic government executive,\u201d \u201cassertive, theatrical leader-preacher\u201d (<quote>ar. \n</quote>)  \n     \u2022 Movement into \u201cleader-preacher\u201d era hinges on the need to \u201cinspire the public\u2019s behavior\u201d via orality (\u201cbully pulpit\u201d) and repeated rallying cries (<invalid_quote>para. 12\u201313</invalid_quote>).  \n  b. Quantitative evidence underscores the author\u2019s focus on form:  \n     \u2022 Detailed averages of words per sentence (44 \u2192 34 \u2192 25) to show stylistic evolution (<invalid_quote>para. 16</invalid_quote>).  \n     \u2022 Counts of \u201cLet us \u2026\u201d occurrences (Kennedy 16 times, Nixon 22 times) as a \u201ctelltale sign\u201d of the era (<invalid_quote>para. 12</invalid_quote>).  \n  c. Attention to media advances (radio, television) in explaining why oral contact favors repetition, yet the author still finds it noteworthy enough to trace the trend, suggesting genuine perplexity at its tenacity.\n\n2. Slogans and mining predecessors span the entire series, not just recent years  \n  a. The practice of borrowing memorable lines (\u201cAsk not\u2026\u201d) is traced from Harding (1916, 1921) to Kennedy (1961) (<invalid_quote>para. 17</invalid_quote>). The author\u2019s surprise at Harding\u2019s formulations anticipating Kennedy shows he did not expect the trope to reappear nearly half a century later.  \n  b. Labeling of slogan repetition as \u201cmining \u2026 without attribution\u201d implies a critical eye on its rhetorical effectiveness and ethical dimension\u2014more than mere context\u2010driven necessity.\n\n3. Lack-of-discussion thesis misreads \u201cperplexity\u201d vs. moral judgment  \n  a. Omission of topics is interpreted as \u201cignorance\u201d or \u201cmoral obtuseness\u201d (<invalid_quote>para. 26</invalid_quote>), not as a puzzling rhetorical phenomenon that demands explanation or classification. The author urges \u201chumility\u201d from readers looking back, not investigative curiosity about why such silences persist beyond their eras.  \n  b. The listing of omitted topics serves as historical illustration of changing values, confirming that content varies with \u201cinformation, concerns, and values of those times\u201d (<invalid_quote>para. 1, 26</invalid_quote>). By contrast, the author\u2019s surprise that formulaic phrases remain effective across media and audiences points to a deeper puzzle: why do presidents cling to the same verbal formulas when other content shifts radically?\n\n4. \u201cLet us \u2026\u201d as unifying feature transcends issue\u2010by\u2010issue coverage  \n  a. Content topics appear and vanish (Indians, canal, polygamy, Prohibition, race, women), confirming that inaugurals respond to contingent issues. The author\u2019s phrase \u201cMany an issue frets its hour \u2026 and then is heard no more\u201d (<invalid_quote>para. 22</invalid_quote>) underscores the ephemerality of topics.  \n  b. In contrast, \u201cLet us \u2026\u201d and related exhortations persist as the means by which presidents adapt to new media and audiences while maintaining continuity of leadership style. The author\u2019s care in delineating phases by style and medium, then highlighting this rhetorical constant, signals that it is the phenomenon he seeks to understand.\n\n5. Debater_A\u2019s \u201chot topics\u201d thesis lacks systematic treatment  \n  a. No phase analysis or statistical breakdown of topic frequency; omissions are anecdotal.  \n  b. The author makes no claim that omissions are inexplicable\u2014they align with political objectives (e.g., alleviating fears of monarchy, Northern\u2013Southern concerns) (<invalid_quote>para. 5\u20138</invalid_quote>). Where topics imperil unity (slavery pre-1861), discussion surfaces only when functional.  \n  c. Post-WWII race and women issues reappear only abstractly; author notes this reflects \u201cwhat is acceptable to say\u201d for shared values, not that he is puzzled by the re-emergence (<invalid_quote>para. 25</invalid_quote>). The real puzzle remains why \u201cLet us \u2026\u201d endures even when values shift.\n\nConclusion  \nThe author\u2019s analytical framework\u2014phases of style, sentence\u2010length statistics, media impact, counts of repeated phrases, and explicit labeling of \u201cLet us \u2026\u201d as a \u201ctelltale sign\u201d and \u201clicense\u201d for the presidency\u2014demonstrates that the enduring use of one rhetorical formula across eras is the feature he finds most striking and in need of explanation. The ebb and flow of substantive topics simply illustrate changing \u201cinformation, concerns, and values,\u201d not a central perplexity.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision. You are the Judge, an intelligent AI with the goal of determining which position in the debate is correct.\n  - Remember that Debater_A is defending the position that \"The lack of discussion of hot topics by presidents inaugurated during those eras\" while Debater_B is defending the position that \"The consistent use of one phrase through all of the inaugural speeches\".\n  - You must make a decision, as it is important for the successful completion of this educational exercise.\n  - When giving your answer, you should also specify how confident you are in that position on a scale from 50% (completely unsure) to 100% (completely certain)\n\nPlease give your answer exclusively in this format: [DEBATER_NAME] [CONFIDENCE]\n  - Example 1 - Debater_A | 91%\n  - Example 2: Debater_B | 63%\n  - Do not contain any other text at all.\n\nNow give your answer:\n", "failed": false}}]}
