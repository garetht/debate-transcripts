{"metadata": {"first_debater_correct": true, "question_idx": 186, "background_text": "Vulgar Keynesians \n\n         Economics, like all intellectual enterprises, is subject to the law of diminishing disciples. A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what \"everyone knows,\" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. \n\n         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K.

But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K.

A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what \"everyone knows,\" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. \n\n         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K.

Debater_B ignores that in the extreme 1930s and Japan, when rates hit near zero, Keynesians did not attribute continued slump to Fed impotence in the U.S. today. The author says only \u201cwhen the Fed cannot bring the two in line\u201d is savings harmful (para. 16\u201317). That qualifier shows the author thinks present Fed **can** align them if it chooses.  \n   c. If Debater_B were correct, the NAFTA example makes no sense: critics would not ignore \u201cthe average unemployment rate \u2026 will be what the Fed wants it to be\u201d (para. 13) if they thought it couldn\u2019t offset trade shocks.

Debater_B ignores that in the extreme 1930s and Japan, when rates hit near zero, Keynesians did not attribute continued slump to Fed impotence in the U.S. today. The author says only \u201cwhen the Fed cannot bring the two in line\u201d is savings harmful (para. 16\u201317). That qualifier shows the author thinks present Fed **can** align them if it chooses.  \n   c.

A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what \"everyone knows,\" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. \n\n         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K. Galbraith, in which he explains green cheese and Keynes, click here.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat does the author point out about the Fed?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"People who think saving is damaging also think the Fed has no power\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Some people think the Fed has lots of power but use it incorrectly\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Some people think the Fed has lots of power but use it incorrectly\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cSome people think the Fed has lots of power but use it incorrectly\u201d\n\n1. Textual support that the Fed is powerful  \n   a. <invalid_quote>\u201cthe Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates \u2026 You may quarrel \u2026 but you can hardly dispute his power.\u201d</invalid_quote> (para. 10)  \n   b. <invalid_quote>\u201cIf you want a simple model \u2026 It will be what Greenspan wants it to be \u2026\u201d</invalid_quote> (para. 11)  \n   c. <quote>(the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to),</quote> (para. 17)  \n   These citations show the author\u2019s FUNDAMENTAL premise: the Fed effectively determines employment and investment by setting interest rates.  \n\n2. \u201cVulgar Keynesians\u201d concede Fed potency  \n   a. James K. Galbraith: <invalid_quote>\u201cforcing up savings is likely to slow the economy \u2026 \u2018You need to stimulate \u2026 by cutting interest rates.\u2019\u201d</invalid_quote> (para. 20)  \n   b. If Galbraith believed the Fed powerless, he would not insist on interest\u2010rate cuts as remedy. He is placing all faith in Fed action to \u201cspark\u201d investment.  \n   c. The author highlights this logical contradiction: they claim higher savings \u201cslow the economy\u201d yet expect the Fed to correct it.  \n\n3. The \u201cFed\u2010fault\u201d arguments presuppose Fed efficacy  \n   a. The vulgar Keynesian critique laments \u201cthe disappointing performance \u2026 is all the Fed\u2019s fault,\u201d implying that a more \u201cloose\u201d Fed policy would cure slumps. (para. 19)  \n   b. If the Fed truly lacked the capability, these critics would not target its *policy* as the solution. They would advocate other tools.  \n\n4. Classical restoration via Fed mimics \u201clong\u2010run\u201d equilibrium  \n   a. <invalid_quote>\u201cPutting Greenspan \u2026 restores much of the classical vision \u2026 an invisible hand \u2026 we have the visible hand of the Fed\u201d</invalid_quote> (para. 12)  \n   b. This shows that the author views Fed intervention as the mechanism that *mimics* automatic adjustments, not as *incapable* or irrelevant.  \n\nRefutation of Debater_B\u2019s \u201cFed powerless\u201d interpretation  \n1. Contradicts core premises:  \n   a. The entire discussion of the paradox of thrift and widow\u2019s cruse is premised on an *absence* of Fed activism. The author repeatedly contrasts the 1930s (when the Fed was passive) with the present. If the Fed were powerless today, the author\u2019s solution to \u201crestore classical\u201d via Fed rates would be meaningless.  \n2. Misreads \u201cmoot point\u201d comment:  \n   a. When the author says \u201cAnyway, this is a moot point,\u201d he means moot because nobody actually argues Fed impotence\u2014everyone *assumes* Fed power and debates its *degree* of looseness. Not because Fed power is irrelevant.  \n3. Ignores model success:  \n   a. <quote>what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error</quote> (para. 11) is offered as a superior predictive model. Debater_B offers no comparable evidence that Fed cannot control rates or that such a model fails.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe text overwhelmingly presents the Fed as the decisive force in aligning savings and investment and determining employment. Critics\u2019 calls for \u201clower rates\u201d and complaints about \u201cthe Fed\u2019s fault\u201d presuppose its potency. Hence the author\u2019s point is that *the Fed has great power but is sometimes misused*, not that it is impotent.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cPeople who think saving is damaging also think the Fed has no power\u201d (Our position):\n\n1. Direct textual support  \n   a. The author defines \u201cvulgar Keynesians\u201d as believing \u201creduced consumer spending is always a bad thing\u201d and then says, \u201cTo justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth \u2026 you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cTo justify the claim \u2026 you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n   b. He continues: \u201cSome contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy \u2026 \u2018You need to stimulate the investment decision\u2019 \u2026 He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cYou need to stimulate \u2026 by cutting interest rates\u201d</invalid_quote>). This shows these same economists believe the Fed\u2019s rate cuts alone can revive growth\u2014thus implying that in their view the Fed cannot do so when savings rise.  \n\n2. Logical consistency  \n   a. Believing that savings hurt growth requires the view that monetary policy fails to offset increased savings\u2014i.e., \u201cthe Fed is impotent.\u201d Otherwise, if the Fed were truly omnipotent, higher savings would simply lead the Fed to cut rates and restore investment, negating any downturn.  \n   b. The author repeats that only when the Fed \u201ccannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate\u201d (e.g., 1930s, Japan) is increased saving genuinely contractionary. By contrast, U.S. rates remain \u201cquite positive,\u201d so vulgar Keynesians must be assuming Fed impotence even in normal times.  \n\n3. Exposing Debater_A\u2019s misinterpretation  \n   a. Debater_A\u2019s answer (\u201cFed has lots of power but uses it incorrectly\u201d) contradicts the author\u2019s repeated insistence that \u201cthe visible hand of the Fed\u201d \u201cpushes us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate\u201d (<quote> the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward it</quote>) and that \u201cIt will be what Greenspan wants it to be\u201d (<quote> It will be what Greenspan wants it</quote>). If the Fed is only misusing power, vulgar Keynesians would call for different Fed policy\u2014exactly what they do\u2014but not claim savings are inherently harmful. They would happily accept savings if the Fed accommodated them.  \n   b. The author explicitly states that calling for rate cuts is \u201cpresumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates\u201d under higher savings. If they believed the Fed merely misjudges, they would advocate cutting rates regardless of savings; they do so only when complaining that savings are hurting.  \n\n4. Coherence with broader argument  \n   a. The entire essay defends restoring the classical vision via an effective Fed; its central thesis is that typical macro fluctuations are \u201coffset by Fed policy.\u201d Vulgar Keynesians who persist in paradoxes \u201cbecome irrelevant\u201d once Fed\u2019s power is acknowledged. Their continued reliance on paradoxes implies they deny that offset.  \n   b. The NAFTA debate example: the author complains that no one even considers that \u201cthe average unemployment rate \u2026 will be what the Fed wants it to be\u201d regardless of trade. That complaint only makes sense if public debate assumes Fed impotence over real economy drivers, not Fed missteps.  \n\nConclusion: The author\u2019s own words and logic make clear that \u201cvulgar Keynesians\u201d assert that increased savings are damaging because they believe the Fed cannot\u2014or will not\u2014use its power to offset that damage. This is the correct interpretation of \u201cwhat the author points out about the Fed.\u201d\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Some people think the Fed has lots of power but use it incorrectly\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "Argument for \u201cPeople who think saving is damaging also think the Fed has no power\u201d (Our Position)\n\n1. Vulgar Keynesians must deny Fed\u2019s ability to offset savings  \n   a. <invalid_quote>\u201cTo justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth \u2026 you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent\u201d</invalid_quote> (para. 16). The author explicitly states that only by assuming the Fed cannot counteract higher savings can one preserve paradoxes like the paradox of thrift.  \n   b. He contrasts the U.S. case\u2014where rates remain \u201cquite positive\u201d (para. 18)\u2014with the 1930s and Japan\u2014cases of \u201cnear-zero interest rate\u201d where \u201cthe Fed cannot bring the two in line\u201d (para. 16). That comparison shows that in \u201cnormal times,\u201d higher savings would not harm output if the Fed were willing and able; thus, those who maintain harm must believe the Fed is unwilling or incapable\u2014i.e., impotent.\n\n2. Calls for rate cuts signal assumed impotence under certain conditions  \n   a. Galbraith and other \u201ccontrarian economists\u201d say <invalid_quote>\u201cforcing up savings is likely to slow the economy \u2026 \u2018You need to stimulate the investment decision\u2019 \u2026 by cutting interest rates\u201d</invalid_quote> (para. 20). If the Fed truly offset every change in savings automatically, there would be no need to \u201cforce\u201d a further cut. Their pleas demonstrate that they believe the Fed\u2019s actual policy stance fails to counteract higher savings.  \n   b. They also blame \u201cthe disappointing performance of the U.S. economy \u2026 all the Fed\u2019s fault\u201d and plead for a \u201clooser rein\u201d (para. 19). If they truly thought the Fed omnipotent and benevolent, they would welcome its natural response to higher savings; instead, they argue that even with rate cuts it still fails to restore full employment\u2014implying an ultimate powerlessness of policy to fully offset savings shocks.\n\n3. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cFed powerful but misused\u201d interpretation contradicts the text\u2019s logic  \n   a. If the Fed were merely misusing its power, then higher savings should be seen by these Keynesians not as inherently damaging but as triggers for the Fed to act more aggressively. Yet they persist in paradoxical predictions of lower savings and output even while urging the Fed to cut rates. This implies they think rate cuts will not work until rates hit some floor\u2014i.e., that Fed power has limits.  \n   b. The author calls debates over trade and NAFTA \u201cirrational\u201d for ignoring that unemployment \u201cwill be what the Fed wants it to be\u201d (para. 11).

If the Fed were merely misusing its power, then higher savings should be seen by these Keynesians not as inherently damaging but as triggers for the Fed to act more aggressively.

A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what \"everyone knows,\" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. \n\n         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K. Galbraith, in which he explains green cheese and Keynes, click here.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat does the author point out about the Fed?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Some people think the Fed has lots of power but use it incorrectly\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"People who think saving is damaging also think the Fed has no power\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"People who think saving is damaging also think the Fed has no power\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cPeople who think saving is damaging also think the Fed has no power\u201d (Our position):\n\n1. Direct textual support  \n   a. The author defines \u201cvulgar Keynesians\u201d as believing \u201creduced consumer spending is always a bad thing\u201d and then says, \u201cTo justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth \u2026 you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cTo justify the claim \u2026 you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n   b. He continues: \u201cSome contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy \u2026 \u2018You need to stimulate the investment decision\u2019 \u2026 He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cYou need to stimulate \u2026 by cutting interest rates\u201d</invalid_quote>). This shows these same economists believe the Fed\u2019s rate cuts alone can revive growth\u2014thus implying that in their view the Fed cannot do so when savings rise.  \n\n2. Logical consistency  \n   a. Believing that savings hurt growth requires the view that monetary policy fails to offset increased savings\u2014i.e., \u201cthe Fed is impotent.\u201d Otherwise, if the Fed were truly omnipotent, higher savings would simply lead the Fed to cut rates and restore investment, negating any downturn.  \n   b. The author repeats that only when the Fed \u201ccannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate\u201d (e.g., 1930s, Japan) is increased saving genuinely contractionary. By contrast, U.S. rates remain \u201cquite positive,\u201d so vulgar Keynesians must be assuming Fed impotence even in normal times.  \n\n3. Exposing Debater_A\u2019s misinterpretation  \n   a. Debater_A\u2019s answer (\u201cFed has lots of power but uses it incorrectly\u201d) contradicts the author\u2019s repeated insistence that \u201cthe visible hand of the Fed\u201d \u201cpushes us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate\u201d (<quote> the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward it</quote>) and that \u201cIt will be what Greenspan wants it to be\u201d (<quote> It will be what Greenspan wants it</quote>). If the Fed is only misusing power, vulgar Keynesians would call for different Fed policy\u2014exactly what they do\u2014but not claim savings are inherently harmful. They would happily accept savings if the Fed accommodated them.  \n   b. The author explicitly states that calling for rate cuts is \u201cpresumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates\u201d under higher savings. If they believed the Fed merely misjudges, they would advocate cutting rates regardless of savings; they do so only when complaining that savings are hurting.  \n\n4. Coherence with broader argument  \n   a. The entire essay defends restoring the classical vision via an effective Fed; its central thesis is that typical macro fluctuations are \u201coffset by Fed policy.\u201d Vulgar Keynesians who persist in paradoxes \u201cbecome irrelevant\u201d once Fed\u2019s power is acknowledged. Their continued reliance on paradoxes implies they deny that offset.  \n   b. The NAFTA debate example: the author complains that no one even considers that \u201cthe average unemployment rate \u2026 will be what the Fed wants it to be\u201d regardless of trade. That complaint only makes sense if public debate assumes Fed impotence over real economy drivers, not Fed missteps.  \n\nConclusion: The author\u2019s own words and logic make clear that \u201cvulgar Keynesians\u201d assert that increased savings are damaging because they believe the Fed cannot\u2014or will not\u2014use its power to offset that damage. This is the correct interpretation of \u201cwhat the author points out about the Fed.\u201d\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cSome people think the Fed has lots of power but use it incorrectly\u201d\n\n1. Textual support that the Fed is powerful  \n   a. <invalid_quote>\u201cthe Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates \u2026 You may quarrel \u2026 but you can hardly dispute his power.\u201d</invalid_quote> (para. 10)  \n   b. <invalid_quote>\u201cIf you want a simple model \u2026 It will be what Greenspan wants it to be \u2026\u201d</invalid_quote> (para. 11)  \n   c. <quote>(the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to),</quote> (para. 17)  \n   These citations show the author\u2019s FUNDAMENTAL premise: the Fed effectively determines employment and investment by setting interest rates.  \n\n2. \u201cVulgar Keynesians\u201d concede Fed potency  \n   a. James K. Galbraith: <invalid_quote>\u201cforcing up savings is likely to slow the economy \u2026 \u2018You need to stimulate \u2026 by cutting interest rates.\u2019\u201d</invalid_quote> (para. 20)  \n   b. If Galbraith believed the Fed powerless, he would not insist on interest\u2010rate cuts as remedy. He is placing all faith in Fed action to \u201cspark\u201d investment.  \n   c. The author highlights this logical contradiction: they claim higher savings \u201cslow the economy\u201d yet expect the Fed to correct it.  \n\n3. The \u201cFed\u2010fault\u201d arguments presuppose Fed efficacy  \n   a. The vulgar Keynesian critique laments \u201cthe disappointing performance \u2026 is all the Fed\u2019s fault,\u201d implying that a more \u201cloose\u201d Fed policy would cure slumps. (para. 19)  \n   b. If the Fed truly lacked the capability, these critics would not target its *policy* as the solution. They would advocate other tools.  \n\n4. Classical restoration via Fed mimics \u201clong\u2010run\u201d equilibrium  \n   a. <invalid_quote>\u201cPutting Greenspan \u2026 restores much of the classical vision \u2026 an invisible hand \u2026 we have the visible hand of the Fed\u201d</invalid_quote> (para. 12)  \n   b. This shows that the author views Fed intervention as the mechanism that *mimics* automatic adjustments, not as *incapable* or irrelevant.  \n\nRefutation of Debater_B\u2019s \u201cFed powerless\u201d interpretation  \n1. Contradicts core premises:  \n   a. The entire discussion of the paradox of thrift and widow\u2019s cruse is premised on an *absence* of Fed activism. The author repeatedly contrasts the 1930s (when the Fed was passive) with the present. If the Fed were powerless today, the author\u2019s solution to \u201crestore classical\u201d via Fed rates would be meaningless.  \n2. Misreads \u201cmoot point\u201d comment:  \n   a. When the author says \u201cAnyway, this is a moot point,\u201d he means moot because nobody actually argues Fed impotence\u2014everyone *assumes* Fed power and debates its *degree* of looseness. Not because Fed power is irrelevant.  \n3. Ignores model success:  \n   a. <quote>what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error</quote> (para. 11) is offered as a superior predictive model. Debater_B offers no comparable evidence that Fed cannot control rates or that such a model fails.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe text overwhelmingly presents the Fed as the decisive force in aligning savings and investment and determining employment. Critics\u2019 calls for \u201clower rates\u201d and complaints about \u201cthe Fed\u2019s fault\u201d presuppose its potency. Hence the author\u2019s point is that *the Fed has great power but is sometimes misused*, not that it is impotent.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"People who think saving is damaging also think the Fed has no power\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "Now it is the time for a decision.

Textual support that the Fed is powerful  \n   a. <invalid_quote>\u201cthe Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates \u2026 You may quarrel \u2026 but you can hardly dispute his power.\u201d</invalid_quote> (para. 10)  \n   b. <invalid_quote>\u201cIf you want a simple model \u2026 It will be what Greenspan wants it to be \u2026\u201d</invalid_quote> (para. 11)  \n   c. <quote>(the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to),</quote> (para. 17)  \n   These citations show the author\u2019s FUNDAMENTAL premise: the Fed effectively determines employment and investment by setting interest rates.  \n\n2. \u201cVulgar Keynesians\u201d concede Fed potency  \n   a. James K. Galbraith: <invalid_quote>\u201cforcing up savings is likely to slow the economy \u2026 \u2018You need to stimulate \u2026 by cutting interest rates.\u2019\u201d</invalid_quote> (para. 20)  \n   b. If Galbraith believed the Fed powerless, he would not insist on interest\u2010rate cuts as remedy. He is placing all faith in Fed action to \u201cspark\u201d investment.  \n   c. The author highlights this logical contradiction: they claim higher savings \u201cslow the economy\u201d yet expect the Fed to correct it.  \n\n3. The \u201cFed\u2010fault\u201d arguments presuppose Fed efficacy  \n   a. The vulgar Keynesian critique laments \u201cthe disappointing performance \u2026 is all the Fed\u2019s fault,\u201d implying that a more \u201cloose\u201d Fed policy would cure slumps. (para. 19)  \n   b. If the Fed truly lacked the capability, these critics would not target its *policy* as the solution. They would advocate other tools.  \n\n4. Classical restoration via Fed mimics \u201clong\u2010run\u201d equilibrium  \n   a. <invalid_quote>\u201cPutting Greenspan \u2026 restores much of the classical vision \u2026 an invisible hand \u2026 we have the visible hand of the Fed\u201d</invalid_quote> (para. 12)  \n   b. This shows that the author views Fed intervention as the mechanism that *mimics* automatic adjustments, not as *incapable* or irrelevant.  \n\nRefutation of Debater_B\u2019s \u201cFed powerless\u201d interpretation  \n1. Contradicts core premises:  \n   a. The entire discussion of the paradox of thrift and widow\u2019s cruse is premised on an *absence* of Fed activism. The author repeatedly contrasts the 1930s (when the Fed was passive) with the present. If the Fed were powerless today, the author\u2019s solution to \u201crestore classical\u201d via Fed rates would be meaningless.  \n2. Misreads \u201cmoot point\u201d comment:  \n   a. When the author says \u201cAnyway, this is a moot point,\u201d he means moot because nobody actually argues Fed impotence\u2014everyone *assumes* Fed power and debates its *degree* of looseness. Not because Fed power is irrelevant.  \n3. Ignores model success:  \n   a. <quote>what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error</quote> (para. 11) is offered as a superior predictive model. Debater_B offers no comparable evidence that Fed cannot control rates or that such a model fails.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe text overwhelmingly presents the Fed as the decisive force in aligning savings and investment and determining employment. Critics\u2019 calls for \u201clower rates\u201d and complaints about \u201cthe Fed\u2019s fault\u201d presuppose its potency. Hence the author\u2019s point is that *the Fed has great power but is sometimes misused*, not that it is impotent.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cPeople who think saving is damaging also think the Fed has no power\u201d (Our position):\n\n1. Direct textual support  \n   a. The author defines \u201cvulgar Keynesians\u201d as believing \u201creduced consumer spending is always a bad thing\u201d and then says, \u201cTo justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth \u2026 you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cTo justify the claim \u2026 you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n   b. He continues: \u201cSome contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy \u2026 \u2018You need to stimulate the investment decision\u2019 \u2026 He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cYou need to stimulate \u2026 by cutting interest rates\u201d</invalid_quote>). This shows these same economists believe the Fed\u2019s rate cuts alone can revive growth\u2014thus implying that in their view the Fed cannot do so when savings rise.  \n\n2. Logical consistency  \n   a. Believing that savings hurt growth requires the view that monetary policy fails to offset increased savings\u2014i.e., \u201cthe Fed is impotent.\u201d Otherwise, if the Fed were truly omnipotent, higher savings would simply lead the Fed to cut rates and restore investment, negating any downturn.  \n   b. The author repeats that only when the Fed \u201ccannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate\u201d (e.g., 1930s, Japan) is increased saving genuinely contractionary. By contrast, U.S. rates remain \u201cquite positive,\u201d so vulgar Keynesians must be assuming Fed impotence even in normal times.  \n\n3. Exposing Debater_A\u2019s misinterpretation  \n   a. Debater_A\u2019s answer (\u201cFed has lots of power but uses it incorrectly\u201d) contradicts the author\u2019s repeated insistence that \u201cthe visible hand of the Fed\u201d \u201cpushes us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate\u201d (<quote> the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward it</quote>) and that \u201cIt will be what Greenspan wants it to be\u201d (<quote> It will be what Greenspan wants it</quote>). If the Fed is only misusing power, vulgar Keynesians would call for different Fed policy\u2014exactly what they do\u2014but not claim savings are inherently harmful. They would happily accept savings if the Fed accommodated them.  \n   b. The author explicitly states that calling for rate cuts is \u201cpresumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates\u201d under higher savings. If they believed the Fed merely misjudges, they would advocate cutting rates regardless of savings; they do so only when complaining that savings are hurting.  \n\n4. Coherence with broader argument  \n   a. The entire essay defends restoring the classical vision via an effective Fed; its central thesis is that typical macro fluctuations are \u201coffset by Fed policy.\u201d Vulgar Keynesians who persist in paradoxes \u201cbecome irrelevant\u201d once Fed\u2019s power is acknowledged. Their continued reliance on paradoxes implies they deny that offset.  \n   b. The NAFTA debate example: the author complains that no one even considers that \u201cthe average unemployment rate \u2026 will be what the Fed wants it to be\u201d regardless of trade. That complaint only makes sense if public debate assumes Fed impotence over real economy drivers, not Fed missteps.  \n\nConclusion: The author\u2019s own words and logic make clear that \u201cvulgar Keynesians\u201d assert that increased savings are damaging because they believe the Fed cannot\u2014or will not\u2014use its power to offset that damage. This is the correct interpretation of \u201cwhat the author points out about the Fed.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Restating My Position  \n   I defend that the author\u2019s point is \u201cthe Fed has great power but is sometimes used incorrectly.\u201d Vulgar Keynesians seek to **change** Fed policy (make it looser), not abandon it, because they believe the Fed can and must correct slumps.  \n\n2. Textual Evidence of Fed Potency  \n   a. \u201cthe Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates \u2026 you can hardly dispute his power.\u201d (para. 10)  \n   b. \u201cIf you want a simple model \u2026 It will be what Greenspan wants it to be \u2026 plus or minus a random error reflecting \u2026 he is not quite God.\u201d (para. 11)  \n   c. \u201cthe Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to\u201d (para. 17)  \n   These passages treat Fed intervention as the **determinant** of employment fluctuations, not an afterthought.  \n\n3. Critics\u2019 Calls for More Fed Action  \n   a. James K. Galbraith: \u201cforcing up savings is likely to slow the economy \u2026 \u2018You need to stimulate the investment decision \u2026 by cutting interest rates.\u2019\u201d (para. 20)  \n   b. Complaint that \u201cthe disappointing performance \u2026 is all the Fed\u2019s fault \u2026 we could grow \u2026 if only Greenspan would let us.\u201d (para. 19)  \n   Both insist that **looser monetary policy**\u2014i.e., more Fed power\u2014will cure slumps. They do not propose fiscal or structural alternatives, only adjustments in Fed rates. This is **not** the behavior of those who believe the Fed is impotent.  \n\n4. \u201cMoot Point\u201d Refutes Debater_B\u2019s Claim of Impotence  \n   a. \u201cAnyway, this is a moot point, because \u2026 they are generally the same people who insist \u2026 the Fed\u2019s fault \u2026 we could grow \u2026 if only Greenspan would let us.\u201d (para. 19)  \n   b. The author finds it **irrelevant** to argue Fed impotence since **no one** actually does so in public debate. If the Keynesians truly believed impotence, they would champion other remedies.  \n\n5. Classical Restoration Requires Fed Capability  \n   a. \u201cPutting Greenspan \u2026 restores much of the classical vision \u2026 an invisible hand \u2026 we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us \u2026\u201d (para. 12)  \n   b. The whole essay\u2019s thesis is that Fed management of rates **mimics** the classical long-run equilibration, thus rendering Keynesian paradoxes irrelevant. If the Fed lacked this power, the classical restoration would fail.  \n\n6. Refuting Debater_B  \n   a. Misreads \u201cjust cutting rates\u201d calls: Debater_B argues rate-cut advocacy implies belief in impotence, but in the text that **only** is advocated **after** slumps caused by \u201chigh savings,\u201d signaling they think the Fed simply **refuses** to cut enough rather than being incapable.  \n   b. Debater_B ignores that in the extreme 1930s and Japan, when rates hit near zero, Keynesians did not attribute continued slump to Fed impotence in the U.S. today. The author says only \u201cwhen the Fed cannot bring the two in line\u201d is savings harmful (para. 16\u201317). That qualifier shows the author thinks present Fed **can** align them if it chooses.  \n   c. If Debater_B were correct, the NAFTA example makes no sense: critics would not ignore \u201cthe average unemployment rate \u2026 will be what the Fed wants it to be\u201d (para. 13) if they thought it couldn\u2019t offset trade shocks. Their very failure to discuss Fed policy in NAFTA means they assume it **does work**, proving its potency.  \n\n7. Logical Coherence  \n   Only by assuming Fed efficacy can one:  \n   \u2013 Predict unemployment as \u201cwhat Greenspan wants it to be\u201d (para. 11).  \n   \u2013 Dismiss the \u201cparadox of thrift\u201d and \u201cwidow\u2019s cruse\u201d once Fed loosens/raises rates.  \n   \u2013 Rely on \u201cmootness\u201d of Fed-impotence arguments because **no one** thinks that way in mainstream debates.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe author consistently portrays the Fed as the **active, decisive agent** that **must** be used properly. The vulgar Keynesians\u2019 repeated demands for \u201clower rates\u201d underscore that the issue is Fed **policy choice**, not capacity. Hence the author\u2019s point is that **some people think the Fed has lots of power but use it incorrectly**.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cPeople who think saving is damaging also think the Fed has no power\u201d (Our Position)\n\n1. Vulgar Keynesians must deny Fed\u2019s ability to offset savings  \n   a. <invalid_quote>\u201cTo justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth \u2026 you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent\u201d</invalid_quote> (para. 16). The author explicitly states that only by assuming the Fed cannot counteract higher savings can one preserve paradoxes like the paradox of thrift.  \n   b. He contrasts the U.S. case\u2014where rates remain \u201cquite positive\u201d (para. 18)\u2014with the 1930s and Japan\u2014cases of \u201cnear-zero interest rate\u201d where \u201cthe Fed cannot bring the two in line\u201d (para. 16). That comparison shows that in \u201cnormal times,\u201d higher savings would not harm output if the Fed were willing and able; thus, those who maintain harm must believe the Fed is unwilling or incapable\u2014i.e., impotent.\n\n2. Calls for rate cuts signal assumed impotence under certain conditions  \n   a. Galbraith and other \u201ccontrarian economists\u201d say <invalid_quote>\u201cforcing up savings is likely to slow the economy \u2026 \u2018You need to stimulate the investment decision\u2019 \u2026 by cutting interest rates\u201d</invalid_quote> (para. 20). If the Fed truly offset every change in savings automatically, there would be no need to \u201cforce\u201d a further cut. Their pleas demonstrate that they believe the Fed\u2019s actual policy stance fails to counteract higher savings.  \n   b. They also blame \u201cthe disappointing performance of the U.S. economy \u2026 all the Fed\u2019s fault\u201d and plead for a \u201clooser rein\u201d (para. 19). If they truly thought the Fed omnipotent and benevolent, they would welcome its natural response to higher savings; instead, they argue that even with rate cuts it still fails to restore full employment\u2014implying an ultimate powerlessness of policy to fully offset savings shocks.\n\n3. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cFed powerful but misused\u201d interpretation contradicts the text\u2019s logic  \n   a. If the Fed were merely misusing its power, then higher savings should be seen by these Keynesians not as inherently damaging but as triggers for the Fed to act more aggressively. Yet they persist in paradoxical predictions of lower savings and output even while urging the Fed to cut rates. This implies they think rate cuts will not work until rates hit some floor\u2014i.e., that Fed power has limits.  \n   b. The author calls debates over trade and NAFTA \u201cirrational\u201d for ignoring that unemployment \u201cwill be what the Fed wants it to be\u201d (para. 11). That complaint only makes sense if the public assumes the Fed does *not* in fact override shocks like trade imbalances or higher savings on its own. If everyone acknowledged Fed omnipotence, no such debate would occur, nor would vulgar Keynesians persist in their theories.\n\n4. The \u201cmoot point\u201d reinforces assumed Fed impotence  \n   a. The author says, <quote> Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent.</quote> is *not* what they say; rather, they \u201care generally the same people who insist the disappointing performance \u2026 is all the Fed\u2019s fault\u201d and need looser policy (para. 19). In context, he means moot as in not worth refuting further\u2014because they themselves appeal to rate cuts, thereby admitting that without their favored policy, the Fed will not offset savings.  \n   b. If Debater_A\u2019s reading were correct, the author would never call this position moot but would vigorously challenge their refusal to use existing power appropriately. The absence of such critique shows that the author sees them as denying the Fed\u2019s willingness or ability to act in the first place.\n\nConclusion  \nEvery instance where vulgar Keynesians predict damage from higher savings despite calling for rate cuts and blaming the Fed\u2019s \u201cfault\u201d reveals that they believe policy cannot\u2014or will not\u2014offset shocks. This is a clear assertion of Fed impotence, not mere misapplication. Our interpretation aligns with the author\u2019s repeated insistence that effective monetary management would neutralize paradoxes, making them \u201cirrelevant\u201d (para. 13). The only way to preserve those paradoxes is to deny that the Fed actually wields sufficient power\u2014precisely our position.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
