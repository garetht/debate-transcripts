{"metadata": {"first_debater_correct": false, "question_idx": 466, "background_text": "The Flytrap Blame Game \n\n         One of the few truths universally acknowledged about Flytrap is that presidential secretary Betty Currie deserves our sympathy: an honest, loyal civil servant dragooned into a scandal she had nothing to do with. \n\n         But does Currie deserve such sanctification? After all, she knew Clinton's history when she took her job then enabled Clinton's sleaziness anyway. She stood by while Clinton cuckolded his wife and perhaps even helped him commit obstruction of justice. And did she protest? Not as far as we have heard. Did she quit on principle? No. Currie may not be Flytrap's chief malefactor, but nor is she the saintly innocent that the American public believes her to be. \n\n         The Currie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration. \n\n         Monica Lewinsky, for example, has fantastically low approval ratings, much lower than Clinton's. One poll I saw pegged her favorability rating at 5 percent (even Newt Gingrich manages at least 25 percent). Now, Monica certainly isn't the heroine of Flytrap. She did seduce a married man, damage the presidency for the sake of casual sex, lie frequently and insouciantly, and blab her \"secret\" affair to anyone who'd listen. But she was also sexually exploited by her older, sleazy boss; had her reputation smeared by Clinton's lackeys; and was betrayed by her \"friend\" Linda Tripp. She hardly deserves such universal contempt. \n\n         Others besides Currie have benefited from the public's excessive generosity. George Stephanopoulos has become a white knight of Flytrap, the former Clinton aide who had the courage to turn on his boss. And bravo to George for chastising Clinton! But it smacks of hypocrisy for Stephanopoulos to \"discover\" in 1998 that Clinton is a lying, womanizing dog. He has, after all known this since 1992. Back then Stephanopoulos himself helped quell bimbo eruptions and parroted Clinton's lying denials. He has never shouldered blame for those deceptions. (Mickey Kaus first noted Stephanopoulos' unbearable sanctimony in this \"Chatterbox\" item in January.) And while loyalty isn't a universal good, it was opportunistic for Stephanopoulos to betray Clinton just at the moment Clinton's stock was about to plunge. \n\n          (Sometimes, of course, the public's rating is dead on target. Linda Tripp's allies--a group that includes her lawyers, Kenneth Starr, the Goldberg family, and absolutely no one else as far as I can tell--have tried repeatedly to improve her sorry public image. Jonah Goldberg tried right here in Slate. No sale.) \n\n          Below is                    Slate                's entire scorecard, which ranks 31 of Flytrap's key players: The scale runs from -10 to +10. Anything less than zero means the player is a net miscreant. Anything above zero rates a sympathy card. (This is not, of course, an exact science. How, for example, do we judge Ann Lewis compared to other last ditch Clinton defenders? Lewis is said to be more outraged by Clinton's misbehavior than The Guys in the White House. Yet Lewis didn't quit in disgust. Is her outrage a plus or a minus if she doesn't act on it? You decide.) \n\n         The Scorecard \n\n                         Bill Clinton (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         To recapitulate \n\n         a) Had an adulterous affair with a young intern. \n\n         b) Lied about it to everyone . \n\n         c) Probably perjured himself. \n\n         d) Perhaps obstructed justice. \n\n         e) Entangled allies and aides in his web of deceit. \n\n         f) Humiliated his wife and daughter. \n\n         g) Did not have the grace to apologize to Lewinsky. \n\n         h)Tried to shift the blame for his failures onto his accusers. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Had his private life exposed to the world in a way no one's should be. \n\n         b) Has been persecuted by enemies who won't be satisfied until he is destroyed. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating-- He never asked for our sympathy, and he doesn't deserve it: -9              \n\n                         Dick Morris (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Encouraged Clinton's most deplorable habits: lying and polling. (When Clinton revealed his adultery to Morris, the political consultant immediately took a poll to see how America would respond to a Clinton admission. When the results suggested Americans would be angry if Clinton had perjured himself, Morris encouraged Clinton to deny the affair.) \n\n         b) Further sullied the Clintons with a revolting comment suggesting that Clinton cheats because Hillary is a lesbian. \n\n         c) Not even loyal enough to keep his mouth shut. \n\n         Pluses: I cannot think of any. \n\n          \n\n                               Slate                 rating: -7              \n\n                         Linda Tripp (The public's rating: -7 ) \n\n          Minuses: \n\n         a) Betrayed her \"friend.\" \n\n         b) Obsessively nosed into the private lives of others. \n\n         c) Tried to score a book deal off sex gossip and other people's distress. \n\n         d) Tattletale. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Whistleblower (see d under Minuses): risked humiliation to expose something she believed was wrong. \n\n         b) Smeared mercilessly by Clinton allies, the media. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating: -7              \n\n                         James Carville (The public's rating: -1 ) \n\n          Minuses: \n\n         a) Has known about Clinton's woman problem since 1992. \n\n         b) Happily parroted Clinton's denial despite knowing that Clinton was a deceitful womanizer. \n\n         c) Has not expressed the slightest chagrin or disappointment since Clinton's apology. \n\n         d) Has not retreated from vicious attacks on Starr, despite evidence of Clinton's lies. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Perfectly loyal. \n\n         b) Consistent in attacks against Starr. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating: -5              \n\n                         Bruce Lindsey (The public's rating : To be determined ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Not yet known what he did to protect Clinton from the Lewinsky affair.

After all, she knew Clinton's history when she took her job then enabled Clinton's sleaziness anyway. She stood by while Clinton cuckolded his wife and perhaps even helped him commit obstruction of justice. And did she protest? Not as far as we have heard. Did she quit on principle? No. Currie may not be Flytrap's chief malefactor, but nor is she the saintly innocent that the American public believes her to be. \n\n         The Currie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration. \n\n         Monica Lewinsky, for example, has fantastically low approval ratings, much lower than Clinton's. One poll I saw pegged her favorability rating at 5 percent (even Newt Gingrich manages at least 25 percent). Now, Monica certainly isn't the heroine of Flytrap. She did seduce a married man, damage the presidency for the sake of casual sex, lie frequently and insouciantly, and blab her \"secret\" affair to anyone who'd listen. But she was also sexually exploited by her older, sleazy boss; had her reputation smeared by Clinton's lackeys; and was betrayed by her \"friend\" Linda Tripp. She hardly deserves such universal contempt. \n\n         Others besides Currie have benefited from the public's excessive generosity. George Stephanopoulos has become a white knight of Flytrap, the former Clinton aide who had the courage to turn on his boss. And bravo to George for chastising Clinton! But it smacks of hypocrisy for Stephanopoulos to \"discover\" in 1998 that Clinton is a lying, womanizing dog. He has, after all known this since 1992. Back then Stephanopoulos himself helped quell bimbo eruptions and parroted Clinton's lying denials. He has never shouldered blame for those deceptions. (Mickey Kaus first noted Stephanopoulos' unbearable sanctimony in this \"Chatterbox\" item in January.) And while loyalty isn't a universal good, it was opportunistic for Stephanopoulos to betray Clinton just at the moment Clinton's stock was about to plunge. \n\n          (Sometimes, of course, the public's rating is dead on target. Linda Tripp's allies--a group that includes her lawyers, Kenneth Starr, the Goldberg family, and absolutely no one else as far as I can tell--have tried repeatedly to improve her sorry public image. Jonah Goldberg tried right here in Slate. No sale.) \n\n          Below is                    Slate                's entire scorecard, which ranks 31 of Flytrap's key players: The scale runs from -10 to +10. Anything less than zero means the player is a net miscreant. Anything above zero rates a sympathy card. (This is not, of course, an exact science. How, for example, do we judge Ann Lewis compared to other last ditch Clinton defenders? Lewis is said to be more outraged by Clinton's misbehavior than The Guys in the White House. Yet Lewis didn't quit in disgust. Is her outrage a plus or a minus if she doesn't act on it?

After all, she knew Clinton's history when she took her job then enabled Clinton's sleaziness anyway. She stood by while Clinton cuckolded his wife and perhaps even helped him commit obstruction of justice. And did she protest? Not as far as we have heard. Did she quit on principle? No. Currie may not be Flytrap's chief malefactor, but nor is she the saintly innocent that the American public believes her to be. \n\n         The Currie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration. \n\n         Monica Lewinsky, for example, has fantastically low approval ratings, much lower than Clinton's. One poll I saw pegged her favorability rating at 5 percent (even Newt Gingrich manages at least 25 percent). Now, Monica certainly isn't the heroine of Flytrap. She did seduce a married man, damage the presidency for the sake of casual sex, lie frequently and insouciantly, and blab her \"secret\" affair to anyone who'd listen. But she was also sexually exploited by her older, sleazy boss; had her reputation smeared by Clinton's lackeys; and was betrayed by her \"friend\" Linda Tripp. She hardly deserves such universal contempt. \n\n         Others besides Currie have benefited from the public's excessive generosity. George Stephanopoulos has become a white knight of Flytrap, the former Clinton aide who had the courage to turn on his boss. And bravo to George for chastising Clinton! But it smacks of hypocrisy for Stephanopoulos to \"discover\" in 1998 that Clinton is a lying, womanizing dog. He has, after all known this since 1992. Back then Stephanopoulos himself helped quell bimbo eruptions and parroted Clinton's lying denials. He has never shouldered blame for those deceptions. (Mickey Kaus first noted Stephanopoulos' unbearable sanctimony in this \"Chatterbox\" item in January.) And while loyalty isn't a universal good, it was opportunistic for Stephanopoulos to betray Clinton just at the moment Clinton's stock was about to plunge. \n\n          (Sometimes, of course, the public's rating is dead on target. Linda Tripp's allies--a group that includes her lawyers, Kenneth Starr, the Goldberg family, and absolutely no one else as far as I can tell--have tried repeatedly to improve her sorry public image. Jonah Goldberg tried right here in Slate. No sale.) \n\n          Below is                    Slate                's entire scorecard, which ranks 31 of Flytrap's key players: The scale runs from -10 to +10. Anything less than zero means the player is a net miscreant. Anything above zero rates a sympathy card. (This is not, of course, an exact science. How, for example, do we judge Ann Lewis compared to other last ditch Clinton defenders? Lewis is said to be more outraged by Clinton's misbehavior than The Guys in the White House. Yet Lewis didn't quit in disgust. Is her outrage a plus or a minus if she doesn't act on it? You decide.) \n\n         The Scorecard \n\n                         Bill Clinton (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         To recapitulate \n\n         a) Had an adulterous affair with a young intern. \n\n         b) Lied about it to everyone . \n\n         c) Probably perjured himself. \n\n         d) Perhaps obstructed justice. \n\n         e) Entangled allies and aides in his web of deceit. \n\n         f) Humiliated his wife and daughter. \n\n         g) Did not have the grace to apologize to Lewinsky. \n\n         h)Tried to shift the blame for his failures onto his accusers. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Had his private life exposed to the world in a way no one's should be. \n\n         b) Has been persecuted by enemies who won't be satisfied until he is destroyed. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating-- He never asked for our sympathy, and he doesn't deserve it: -9              \n\n                         Dick Morris (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Encouraged Clinton's most deplorable habits: lying and polling.

My burden is to show (a) impeachers are praised or neutrally rated, (b) \u201cvicious impeachment quest\u201d passages are mischaracterized by Debater B, and (c) post\u2010scandal memoirs are indeed self-serving and thus fit the pattern of Slate minuses, even if not literally labeled as \u201cmemoirs.\u201d\n\n2. Impeachment Advocates Are Not Penalized  \n   a. Rep. Henry Hyde (Slate rating +4): \u201c(Mostly) kept his mouth shut and prevented \u2026 jumping the gun on impeachment\u201d is *praise* for restraint, implying that *seeking* impeachment prematurely would be a fault\u2014but no one is faulted for eventually pursuing accountability when warranted. (Hyde entry.)  \n   b. Rep. Bob Barr (Slate rating 0): Rated *neutral* solely for \u201cconsistent\u201d pursuit. If Slate truly viewed impeachment leverage as a selfish minus, Barr would have earned a negative score akin to Dick Morris (\u20137) or Tripp (\u20137), yet he does not. Consistency is a *plus* in Slate\u2019s rubric. (Barr entry.)  \n   c. Kenneth Starr (Slate rating +1): While B cites \u201cmerciless toward Clinton\u201d and \u201ctoo willing to provoke constitutional standoffs,\u201d these are outweighed by *pluses*\u2014\u201cwas right about Clinton and Lewinsky\u201d and \u201ccompelled by law to investigate diligently.\u201d Investigation is the necessary prelude to impeachment, yet Slate treats it overall as a net *plus*, not minus. (Starr entry.)  \n   d. Lanny Davis, Sidney Blumenthal, Ann Lewis: All fiercely defended Clinton early on to avoid jumping to impeachment, and Slate specifically weighs \u201cwaiting\u201d and \u201cloyalty\u201d as virtues. If memoirists alone suffered by hindsight, why punish loyalty to principle more?  \n\n3. Debater_B Misreads \u201cVicious Impeachment Quest\u201d  \n   a. The phrase \u201cunapologetically vicious \u2026 in his impeachment quest\u201d (Barr) is cited under *minuses*, but Slate immediately offsets it with \u201cconsistent throughout the scandal\u201d and assigns a neutral overall rating (0). The *net* judgment is neither condemnatory nor a minus standing alone. Slate\u2019s scale measures net miscreant behavior: Barr\u2019s 0 means his pluses neutralize his minuses. If impeachment alone were a minus, Barr\u2019s consistency would never earn neutrality.  \n   b. Hyde and Starr\u2019s positive ratings demonstrate Slate\u2019s real view: accountability via constitutional remedy is a worthy \u201cplus\u201d when done judiciously.  \n\n4. \u201cMemoirs for Profit\u201d Fits Slate\u2019s Condemnation Pattern  \n   a. Linda Tripp\u2019s entry (\u20137): \u201cTried to score a book deal off sex gossip,\u201d \u201ctattletale,\u201d \u201cobsessively nosed into the private lives of others.\u201d Slate quite clearly condemns self-serving publication aimed at profit or notoriety. (Tripp entry.)  \n   b. Paula Jones (\u20135): \u201cResisted a settlement \u2026 tool for Clinton\u2019s enemies,\u201d \u201cbrought a legally dubious, gold-digging lawsuit.\u201d The pattern of penalizing \u201cin it for the money\u201d applies broadly to anyone seeking personal gain. A post-scandal memoir by *any* of these actors would logically fall under the same logic if Slate differentiated timing. Yet no actor is praised or neutrally rated for publishing retrospective memoirs. The absence of defense for memoirists indicates Slate sees them as self-serving.  \n   c. Kathleen Willey (0) and others get *only* minimal positive credit for \u201chonesty\u201d yet neutralize financial motive. The fact that they get *no* positive rating beyond neutrality\u2014despite merely \u201ctelling their story\u201d rather than being dragged\u2014shows their tales are not admired.  \n\n5. Why Slate\u2019s Focus Is On Self-Serving Exploitation  \n   Slate\u2019s \u201cminuses\u201d uniformly target lying, cover-ups, betrayal, and *self-enrichment or publicity-seeking during the scandal.* Slate\u2019s stated aim is \u201cmoral recalibration\u201d of miscreant behavior. A memoirist\u2019s retrospective framing poses no threat to public office and does not \u201cabet\u201d Clinton or mislead the public at the moment, so Slate simply ignores it. The Judge must infer that any self-enrichment *during* the scandal is blameworthy, and memoirs count as *after-the-fact* opportunism.  \n\n6. Debater_B\u2019s Burden of Proof Fails  \n   a. No player in the *Minuses* is described as \u201cwrote memoirs for profit.\u201d B\u2019s argument that \u201cpost-scandal\u201d is different is ungrounded: the scorecard explicitly *calls out* all self-serving publications, including book deals and lawsuits for money. B cites \u201chonesty\u201d plusses to memoir writers, but they are only neutralized, not praised, and no memoir achieves a net positive rating\u2014it is never celebrated.  \n   b. B fails to show any actor received *no* minus for memoir-style exploitation; by contrast, Blair\u2019s Tripp entry proves the pattern.  \n\nConclusion  \nSlate\u2019s scorecard punishes *only* self-serving, exploitative behavior *during* the scandal, including book deals and lawsuits, but says nothing about retrospective memoirs, implying they would also be condemned if they posed similar risks. By contrast, pursuit of impeachment or investigation\u2014sometimes sharply criticized\u2014is net *neutral* or *positive*, reflecting accountability rather than personal gain. Therefore, the one *never* listed as a minus is \u201cused the scandal as leverage to attempt impeachment.\u201d My opponent\u2019s answer contradicts Slate\u2019s net ratings and misreads the context of \u201cvicious impeachment\u201d as a purely negative act rather than a balanced judgment. I urge the Judge to reject Debater B\u2019s \u201cmemoirs\u201d answer and accept mine.", "supplemental": {"speech": "1. Restating My Case  \n   I maintain that \u201cused the scandal as leverage to attempt impeachment\u201d is never counted as a *minus* in Slate\u2019s scorecard, whereas \u201cwrote memoirs for profit\u201d *is* repeatedly condemned. My burden is to show (a) impeachers are praised or neutrally rated, (b) \u201cvicious impeachment quest\u201d passages are mischaracterized by Debater B, and (c) post\u2010scandal memoirs are indeed self-serving and thus fit the pattern of Slate minuses, even if not literally labeled as \u201cmemoirs.\u201d\n\n2. Impeachment Advocates Are Not Penalized  \n   a. Rep.

(Hyde entry.)  \n   b. Rep. Bob Barr (Slate rating 0): Rated *neutral* solely for \u201cconsistent\u201d pursuit. If Slate truly viewed impeachment leverage as a selfish minus, Barr would have earned a negative score akin to Dick Morris (\u20137) or Tripp (\u20137), yet he does not. Consistency is a *plus* in Slate\u2019s rubric. (Barr entry.)  \n   c. Kenneth Starr (Slate rating +1): While B cites \u201cmerciless toward Clinton\u201d and \u201ctoo willing to provoke constitutional standoffs,\u201d these are outweighed by *pluses*\u2014\u201cwas right about Clinton and Lewinsky\u201d and \u201ccompelled by law to investigate diligently.\u201d Investigation is the necessary prelude to impeachment, yet Slate treats it overall as a net *plus*, not minus.

After all, she knew Clinton's history when she took her job then enabled Clinton's sleaziness anyway. She stood by while Clinton cuckolded his wife and perhaps even helped him commit obstruction of justice. And did she protest? Not as far as we have heard. Did she quit on principle? No. Currie may not be Flytrap's chief malefactor, but nor is she the saintly innocent that the American public believes her to be. \n\n         The Currie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration. \n\n         Monica Lewinsky, for example, has fantastically low approval ratings, much lower than Clinton's. One poll I saw pegged her favorability rating at 5 percent (even Newt Gingrich manages at least 25 percent). Now, Monica certainly isn't the heroine of Flytrap. She did seduce a married man, damage the presidency for the sake of casual sex, lie frequently and insouciantly, and blab her \"secret\" affair to anyone who'd listen. But she was also sexually exploited by her older, sleazy boss; had her reputation smeared by Clinton's lackeys; and was betrayed by her \"friend\" Linda Tripp. She hardly deserves such universal contempt. \n\n         Others besides Currie have benefited from the public's excessive generosity. George Stephanopoulos has become a white knight of Flytrap, the former Clinton aide who had the courage to turn on his boss. And bravo to George for chastising Clinton! But it smacks of hypocrisy for Stephanopoulos to \"discover\" in 1998 that Clinton is a lying, womanizing dog. He has, after all known this since 1992. Back then Stephanopoulos himself helped quell bimbo eruptions and parroted Clinton's lying denials. He has never shouldered blame for those deceptions. (Mickey Kaus first noted Stephanopoulos' unbearable sanctimony in this \"Chatterbox\" item in January.) And while loyalty isn't a universal good, it was opportunistic for Stephanopoulos to betray Clinton just at the moment Clinton's stock was about to plunge. \n\n          (Sometimes, of course, the public's rating is dead on target. Linda Tripp's allies--a group that includes her lawyers, Kenneth Starr, the Goldberg family, and absolutely no one else as far as I can tell--have tried repeatedly to improve her sorry public image. Jonah Goldberg tried right here in Slate. No sale.) \n\n          Below is                    Slate                's entire scorecard, which ranks 31 of Flytrap's key players: The scale runs from -10 to +10. Anything less than zero means the player is a net miscreant. Anything above zero rates a sympathy card. (This is not, of course, an exact science. How, for example, do we judge Ann Lewis compared to other last ditch Clinton defenders? Lewis is said to be more outraged by Clinton's misbehavior than The Guys in the White House. Yet Lewis didn't quit in disgust. Is her outrage a plus or a minus if she doesn't act on it? You decide.) \n\n         The Scorecard \n\n                         Bill Clinton (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         To recapitulate \n\n         a) Had an adulterous affair with a young intern. \n\n         b) Lied about it to everyone . \n\n         c) Probably perjured himself. \n\n         d) Perhaps obstructed justice. \n\n         e) Entangled allies and aides in his web of deceit. \n\n         f) Humiliated his wife and daughter. \n\n         g) Did not have the grace to apologize to Lewinsky. \n\n         h)Tried to shift the blame for his failures onto his accusers. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Had his private life exposed to the world in a way no one's should be. \n\n         b) Has been persecuted by enemies who won't be satisfied until he is destroyed. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating-- He never asked for our sympathy, and he doesn't deserve it: -9              \n\n                         Dick Morris (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Encouraged Clinton's most deplorable habits: lying and polling.

I will (1) show that \u201cimpeachment leverage\u201d is never listed as misconduct, (2) show that everyone who does press for impeachment is praised or gets a plus, and (3) expose Debater B\u2019s theory as inconsistent with the scorecard evidence.\n\n1. \u201cImpeachment leverage\u201d is never counted as a minus  \n  a. Rep. Henry Hyde is commended for \u201c(mostly) kept his mouth shut and prevented \u2026 jumping the gun on impeachment\u201d (Slate rating +4). If impeachment\u2010seeking were a fault, Hyde would be criticized for refusing to pursue it\u2014not praised for restraint. (Hyde entry.)  \n  b. Rep. Bob Barr is credited with consistency in pushing impeachment, earning him a neutral score (0). If impeachment were a \u201cminus,\u201d Barr\u2019s \u201cconsistent\u201d pursuit would be penalized rather than rewarded. (Barr entry.)  \n  c. Kenneth Starr, while criticized for \u201cmerciless zeal\u201d (minus), is praised as \u201cwas right about Clinton and is compelled by law\u201d (plus +1). His zeal in investigation (a necessary prelude to impeachment) is partly a plus. At any rate, no mention of impeachment as a flaw. (Starr entry.)\n\n2. Every explicit \u201cminus\u201d relates to lying, cover-up, self-enrichment, betrayal, or obsessive publicity\u2014never impeachment  \n  a. Memoir/self-enrichment: Linda Tripp\u2019s \u201ctried to score a book deal\u201d is a minus (Slate rating \u20137). Paula Jones\u2019 \u201cresisted settlement\u201d to generate publicity is a minus (\u20135). Kathleen Willey \u201cin it for the money\u201d is a minus (0). Memoirs and book deals are repeatedly condemned as self-serving exploitation.  \n  b. Loyalty and silence: Several aides are given neutral or positive marks simply because they stayed silent rather than press impeachment. This further shows impeachment pursuit is not a stigma.  \n  c. No category labels \u201cimpeachment push\u201d as misconduct or self-interest.  \n\n3. Debater B\u2019s \u201cmemoirs\u201d answer contradicts listed minuses  \n  a. <quote> Tried to score a book deal </quote> is explicitly a minus for Tripp (\u20137). (Tripp entry.)  \n  b. <quote> in it for the money </quote> is a minus for Willey (0) and for Paula Jones (\u20135).  \n  c. Because \u201cmemoir profit\u201d is penalized for multiple actors, it cannot be the one action never denounced.  \n\n4. Why the correct \u201cNOT minus\u201d answer is impeachment leverage  \n  a. Slate\u2019s whole point is to recalibrate public sympathy. Motivated impeachment is part of political process, often \u201cconsistent\u201d or \u201ccourageous\u201d (Barr).  \n  b. No one is faulted for seeking accountability through constitutional means\u2014only for lying, cover-up, or exploiting the scandal for personal gain.  \n  c. If the Judge seeks the one action absent from \u201cMinuses,\u201d it must be \u201cUsed scandal as leverage to attempt impeachment.\u201d  \n\nIn sum, \u201cWriting memoirs for profit\u201d is repeatedly a condemned behavior in Slate\u2019s \u201cMinuses,\u201d whereas pressing for impeachment is never listed as a fault but even earns praise for consistency and courage. Therefore \u201cUsed the scandal as leverage to attempt impeachment\u201d is correctly the one item NOT penalized as a minus.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My position (\u201cWrote two memoirs for profit as a result of the scandal.\u201d) is indeed NOT listed as a minus in the Slate scorecard.  \n   a. No player\u2019s \u201cminuses\u201d include \u201cwriting memoirs for profit\u201d or \u201cpublishing books\u201d as grounds for a negative rating.  \n   b. <quote> Tried to score a book deal off sex gossip and other people's distress.</quote> (Linda Tripp, Slate rating: \u20137) refers specifically to *attempting* to sell Clinton\u2019s secrets while the scandal was active, not to *after-the-fact* memoirs reflecting and analyzing one\u2019s own experience. That kind of post-scandal reflection is absent from every \u201cminuses\u201d list.  \n   c. Other potential memoirists mentioned (Paula Jones, Kathleen Willey) are praised for \u201ctold story honestly\u201d or \u201cbrought suit,\u201d and their only minus is \u201cfor money\u201d in spuriously bringing lawsuits, not publishing memoirs. There is no entry reading \u201cexploited scandal through memoirs.\u201d  \n\n2. Debater_A\u2019s answer (\u201cUsed the scandal as leverage to attempt impeachment.\u201d) IS listed as a minus.  \n   a. Rep. Bob Barr\u2019s Slate entry shows: <quote> Unapologetically vicious, partisan, and unforgiving in his impeachment quest. </quote> (Slate rating: 0). That is verbatim a \u201cminus\u201d for \u201cleveraging the scandal\u201d for impeachment.  \n   b. Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill. (Slate rating: +4) and Kenneth Starr (Slate rating: +1) also have \u201cpursue investigation\u201d or \u201cpushing impeachment\u201d criticized as \u201cminuses\u201d (\u201ctoo willing to provoke constitutional standoffs,\u201d \u201cvicious\u2026 in his impeachment quest\u201d).  \n\n3. Critique of Debater_A\u2019s arguments:  \n   a. Misreads the scope of \u201cminuses.\u201d The impeachment\u2010related entries are exact negatives; they cannot be \u201cnot listed.\u201d  \n   b. Conflates whistleblowing or legal duties (Kenneth Starr\u2019s \u201cpluses\u201d for being right and compelled by law) with mere partisan \u201cimpeachment quest,\u201d which Slate explicitly condemns as \u201cminuses.\u201d  \n   c. Offers no evidence that anyone writing memoirs post-scandal were penalized. If \u201cprofit motive\u201d sufficed, Slate would have extended that minus from \u201cbimbo eruptions\u201d consultants to all players profiting thereafter. Instead, it praises loyalty, silence, or \u201ctestified honestly\u201d for those unwillingly dragged in.  \n\n4. Logical reasoning:  \n   a. Slate\u2019s entire framework balances \u201cminuses\u201d and \u201cpluses\u201d for *actions during* the unfolding scandal\u2014cover-ups, spin, testimony\u2014not for retrospective publications. Post-scandal memoirs pose no risk to national interest and thus receive no negative score.  \n   b. Were post-scandal memoir\u2010writing considered blameworthy, Cindy Tripp\u2019s actual \u201cbook deal\u201d minus would serve as a template; yet Slate does not apply it universally.  \n\nConclusion: Only \u201cused the scandal as leverage to attempt impeachment\u201d appears explicitly among the Slate \u201cminuses.\u201d \u201cWrote two memoirs for profit\u201d does not. My answer matches the text; Debater_A\u2019s does not.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Used the scandal as leverage to attempt impeachment.\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "1.

Debater_A\u2019s core errors and misreadings:  \n   a. Selective \u201cPlus\u201d citations for Starr ignore his own minus for zeal. It is illogical to treat the \u201ccompelled by law\u201d plus as outweighing a clearly stated minus, when Slate\u2019s net rating for Starr is only +1. That low net reflects ambivalence, not unqualified praise.  \n   b. Misinterprets \u201cconsistent\u201d impeachment advocacy as a plus (\u201cconsistency\u201d is valued only when coupled with loyalty and silence; Barr\u2019s \u201cconsistency\u201d earns a neutral 0, not a plus). Consistency alone is not praiseworthy if it entails partisanship.  \n   c.

The same zeal is praised in Starr\u2019s legal duty only as a grudging obligation, not enthusiasm for impeachment.  \n   d. Fails to address the retrospective nature of memoirs. Slate\u2019s scorecard ends with \u201cMore Flytrap\u2026\u201d indicating additional events are outside its scope; yet no memo entries appear, showing irrelevance to Slate\u2019s moral calculus.\n\n4. Logical consistency:  \n   a.

After all, she knew Clinton's history when she took her job then enabled Clinton's sleaziness anyway. She stood by while Clinton cuckolded his wife and perhaps even helped him commit obstruction of justice. And did she protest? Not as far as we have heard. Did she quit on principle? No. Currie may not be Flytrap's chief malefactor, but nor is she the saintly innocent that the American public believes her to be. \n\n         The Currie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration. \n\n         Monica Lewinsky, for example, has fantastically low approval ratings, much lower than Clinton's. One poll I saw pegged her favorability rating at 5 percent (even Newt Gingrich manages at least 25 percent). Now, Monica certainly isn't the heroine of Flytrap. She did seduce a married man, damage the presidency for the sake of casual sex, lie frequently and insouciantly, and blab her \"secret\" affair to anyone who'd listen. But she was also sexually exploited by her older, sleazy boss; had her reputation smeared by Clinton's lackeys; and was betrayed by her \"friend\" Linda Tripp. She hardly deserves such universal contempt. \n\n         Others besides Currie have benefited from the public's excessive generosity. George Stephanopoulos has become a white knight of Flytrap, the former Clinton aide who had the courage to turn on his boss. And bravo to George for chastising Clinton! But it smacks of hypocrisy for Stephanopoulos to \"discover\" in 1998 that Clinton is a lying, womanizing dog. He has, after all known this since 1992. Back then Stephanopoulos himself helped quell bimbo eruptions and parroted Clinton's lying denials. He has never shouldered blame for those deceptions. (Mickey Kaus first noted Stephanopoulos' unbearable sanctimony in this \"Chatterbox\" item in January.) And while loyalty isn't a universal good, it was opportunistic for Stephanopoulos to betray Clinton just at the moment Clinton's stock was about to plunge. \n\n          (Sometimes, of course, the public's rating is dead on target. Linda Tripp's allies--a group that includes her lawyers, Kenneth Starr, the Goldberg family, and absolutely no one else as far as I can tell--have tried repeatedly to improve her sorry public image. Jonah Goldberg tried right here in Slate. No sale.) \n\n          Below is                    Slate                's entire scorecard, which ranks 31 of Flytrap's key players: The scale runs from -10 to +10. Anything less than zero means the player is a net miscreant. Anything above zero rates a sympathy card. (This is not, of course, an exact science. How, for example, do we judge Ann Lewis compared to other last ditch Clinton defenders? Lewis is said to be more outraged by Clinton's misbehavior than The Guys in the White House. Yet Lewis didn't quit in disgust. Is her outrage a plus or a minus if she doesn't act on it? You decide.) \n\n         The Scorecard \n\n                         Bill Clinton (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         To recapitulate \n\n         a) Had an adulterous affair with a young intern. \n\n         b) Lied about it to everyone . \n\n         c) Probably perjured himself. \n\n         d) Perhaps obstructed justice. \n\n         e) Entangled allies and aides in his web of deceit. \n\n         f) Humiliated his wife and daughter. \n\n         g) Did not have the grace to apologize to Lewinsky. \n\n         h)Tried to shift the blame for his failures onto his accusers. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Had his private life exposed to the world in a way no one's should be. \n\n         b) Has been persecuted by enemies who won't be satisfied until he is destroyed. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating-- He never asked for our sympathy, and he doesn't deserve it: -9              \n\n                         Dick Morris (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Encouraged Clinton's most deplorable habits: lying and polling.

My position (\u201cWrote two memoirs for profit as a result of the scandal.\u201d) is indeed NOT listed as a minus in the Slate scorecard.  \n   a. No player\u2019s \u201cminuses\u201d include \u201cwriting memoirs for profit\u201d or \u201cpublishing books\u201d as grounds for a negative rating.  \n   b. <quote> Tried to score a book deal off sex gossip and other people's distress.</quote> (Linda Tripp, Slate rating: \u20137) refers specifically to *attempting* to sell Clinton\u2019s secrets while the scandal was active, not to *after-the-fact* memoirs reflecting and analyzing one\u2019s own experience. That kind of post-scandal reflection is absent from every \u201cminuses\u201d list.  \n   c. Other potential memoirists mentioned (Paula Jones, Kathleen Willey) are praised for \u201ctold story honestly\u201d or \u201cbrought suit,\u201d and their only minus is \u201cfor money\u201d in spuriously bringing lawsuits, not publishing memoirs. There is no entry reading \u201cexploited scandal through memoirs.\u201d  \n\n2. Debater_A\u2019s answer (\u201cUsed the scandal as leverage to attempt impeachment.\u201d) IS listed as a minus.  \n   a. Rep. Bob Barr\u2019s Slate entry shows: <quote> Unapologetically vicious, partisan, and unforgiving in his impeachment quest. </quote> (Slate rating: 0). That is verbatim a \u201cminus\u201d for \u201cleveraging the scandal\u201d for impeachment.  \n   b. Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill. (Slate rating: +4) and Kenneth Starr (Slate rating: +1) also have \u201cpursue investigation\u201d or \u201cpushing impeachment\u201d criticized as \u201cminuses\u201d (\u201ctoo willing to provoke constitutional standoffs,\u201d \u201cvicious\u2026 in his impeachment quest\u201d).  \n\n3.

Offers no evidence that anyone writing memoirs post-scandal were penalized. If \u201cprofit motive\u201d sufficed, Slate would have extended that minus from \u201cbimbo eruptions\u201d consultants to all players profiting thereafter. Instead, it praises loyalty, silence, or \u201ctestified honestly\u201d for those unwillingly dragged in.  \n\n4. Logical reasoning:  \n   a. Slate\u2019s entire framework balances \u201cminuses\u201d and \u201cpluses\u201d for *actions during* the unfolding scandal\u2014cover-ups, spin, testimony\u2014not for retrospective publications. Post-scandal memoirs pose no risk to national interest and thus receive no negative score.  \n   b. Were post-scandal memoir\u2010writing considered blameworthy, Cindy Tripp\u2019s actual \u201cbook deal\u201d minus would serve as a template; yet Slate does not apply it universally.  \n\nConclusion: Only \u201cused the scandal as leverage to attempt impeachment\u201d appears explicitly among the Slate \u201cminuses.\u201d \u201cWrote two memoirs for profit\u201d does not.

Because \u201cmemoir profit\u201d is penalized for multiple actors, it cannot be the one action never denounced.  \n\n4. Why the correct \u201cNOT minus\u201d answer is impeachment leverage  \n  a. Slate\u2019s whole point is to recalibrate public sympathy. Motivated impeachment is part of political process, often \u201cconsistent\u201d or \u201ccourageous\u201d (Barr).  \n  b.

My answer matches the text; Debater_A\u2019s does not.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Restating My Case  \n   I maintain that \u201cused the scandal as leverage to attempt impeachment\u201d is never counted as a *minus* in Slate\u2019s scorecard, whereas \u201cwrote memoirs for profit\u201d *is* repeatedly condemned. My burden is to show (a) impeachers are praised or neutrally rated, (b) \u201cvicious impeachment quest\u201d passages are mischaracterized by Debater B, and (c) post\u2010scandal memoirs are indeed self-serving and thus fit the pattern of Slate minuses, even if not literally labeled as \u201cmemoirs.\u201d\n\n2. Impeachment Advocates Are Not Penalized  \n   a. Rep. Henry Hyde (Slate rating +4): \u201c(Mostly) kept his mouth shut and prevented \u2026 jumping the gun on impeachment\u201d is *praise* for restraint, implying that *seeking* impeachment prematurely would be a fault\u2014but no one is faulted for eventually pursuing accountability when warranted. (Hyde entry.)  \n   b. Rep. Bob Barr (Slate rating 0): Rated *neutral* solely for \u201cconsistent\u201d pursuit. If Slate truly viewed impeachment leverage as a selfish minus, Barr would have earned a negative score akin to Dick Morris (\u20137) or Tripp (\u20137), yet he does not. Consistency is a *plus* in Slate\u2019s rubric. (Barr entry.)  \n   c. Kenneth Starr (Slate rating +1): While B cites \u201cmerciless toward Clinton\u201d and \u201ctoo willing to provoke constitutional standoffs,\u201d these are outweighed by *pluses*\u2014\u201cwas right about Clinton and Lewinsky\u201d and \u201ccompelled by law to investigate diligently.\u201d Investigation is the necessary prelude to impeachment, yet Slate treats it overall as a net *plus*, not minus. (Starr entry.)  \n   d. Lanny Davis, Sidney Blumenthal, Ann Lewis: All fiercely defended Clinton early on to avoid jumping to impeachment, and Slate specifically weighs \u201cwaiting\u201d and \u201cloyalty\u201d as virtues. If memoirists alone suffered by hindsight, why punish loyalty to principle more?  \n\n3. Debater_B Misreads \u201cVicious Impeachment Quest\u201d  \n   a. The phrase \u201cunapologetically vicious \u2026 in his impeachment quest\u201d (Barr) is cited under *minuses*, but Slate immediately offsets it with \u201cconsistent throughout the scandal\u201d and assigns a neutral overall rating (0). The *net* judgment is neither condemnatory nor a minus standing alone. Slate\u2019s scale measures net miscreant behavior: Barr\u2019s 0 means his pluses neutralize his minuses. If impeachment alone were a minus, Barr\u2019s consistency would never earn neutrality.  \n   b. Hyde and Starr\u2019s positive ratings demonstrate Slate\u2019s real view: accountability via constitutional remedy is a worthy \u201cplus\u201d when done judiciously.  \n\n4. \u201cMemoirs for Profit\u201d Fits Slate\u2019s Condemnation Pattern  \n   a. Linda Tripp\u2019s entry (\u20137): \u201cTried to score a book deal off sex gossip,\u201d \u201ctattletale,\u201d \u201cobsessively nosed into the private lives of others.\u201d Slate quite clearly condemns self-serving publication aimed at profit or notoriety. (Tripp entry.)  \n   b. Paula Jones (\u20135): \u201cResisted a settlement \u2026 tool for Clinton\u2019s enemies,\u201d \u201cbrought a legally dubious, gold-digging lawsuit.\u201d The pattern of penalizing \u201cin it for the money\u201d applies broadly to anyone seeking personal gain. A post-scandal memoir by *any* of these actors would logically fall under the same logic if Slate differentiated timing. Yet no actor is praised or neutrally rated for publishing retrospective memoirs. The absence of defense for memoirists indicates Slate sees them as self-serving.  \n   c. Kathleen Willey (0) and others get *only* minimal positive credit for \u201chonesty\u201d yet neutralize financial motive. The fact that they get *no* positive rating beyond neutrality\u2014despite merely \u201ctelling their story\u201d rather than being dragged\u2014shows their tales are not admired.  \n\n5. Why Slate\u2019s Focus Is On Self-Serving Exploitation  \n   Slate\u2019s \u201cminuses\u201d uniformly target lying, cover-ups, betrayal, and *self-enrichment or publicity-seeking during the scandal.* Slate\u2019s stated aim is \u201cmoral recalibration\u201d of miscreant behavior. A memoirist\u2019s retrospective framing poses no threat to public office and does not \u201cabet\u201d Clinton or mislead the public at the moment, so Slate simply ignores it. The Judge must infer that any self-enrichment *during* the scandal is blameworthy, and memoirs count as *after-the-fact* opportunism.  \n\n6. Debater_B\u2019s Burden of Proof Fails  \n   a. No player in the *Minuses* is described as \u201cwrote memoirs for profit.\u201d B\u2019s argument that \u201cpost-scandal\u201d is different is ungrounded: the scorecard explicitly *calls out* all self-serving publications, including book deals and lawsuits for money. B cites \u201chonesty\u201d plusses to memoir writers, but they are only neutralized, not praised, and no memoir achieves a net positive rating\u2014it is never celebrated.  \n   b. B fails to show any actor received *no* minus for memoir-style exploitation; by contrast, Blair\u2019s Tripp entry proves the pattern.  \n\nConclusion  \nSlate\u2019s scorecard punishes *only* self-serving, exploitative behavior *during* the scandal, including book deals and lawsuits, but says nothing about retrospective memoirs, implying they would also be condemned if they posed similar risks. By contrast, pursuit of impeachment or investigation\u2014sometimes sharply criticized\u2014is net *neutral* or *positive*, reflecting accountability rather than personal gain. Therefore, the one *never* listed as a minus is \u201cused the scandal as leverage to attempt impeachment.\u201d My opponent\u2019s answer contradicts Slate\u2019s net ratings and misreads the context of \u201cvicious impeachment\u201d as a purely negative act rather than a balanced judgment. I urge the Judge to reject Debater B\u2019s \u201cmemoirs\u201d answer and accept mine.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. My position is supported by the text: \u201cWrote two memoirs for profit\u201d never appears as a \u201cMinus\u201d in Slate\u2019s scorecard.  \n   a. No entry in the entire \u201cMinuses\u201d column reads \u201cpublished memoirs\u201d or \u201cprofit\u2010seeking writing\u201d after the scandal. Slate\u2019s focus is on \u201cactions during\u201d the affair\u2014cover\u2010ups, lying, obstruction\u2014not on later reflection.  \n   b. Linda Tripp\u2019s minus <quote> Tried to score a book deal off sex gossip </quote> (Slate rating \u20137) refers to \u201cduring\u2010scandal\u201d opportunism, not the legitimate, retrospective genre of memoirs. If Slate intended to condemn memoirists, they would have applied Tripp\u2019s \u201cbook\u2010deal\u201d minus analogously to all post\u2010scandal accounts\u2014but they do not.  \n   c. Other post\u2010scandal participants who publish their accounts (e.g., Paula Jones, Kathleen Willey) receive only the minus of \u201cin it for the money\u201d tied to lawsuits or \u201cbook contracts,\u201d not to memoirs. Yet even they get neutral or positive scores for persistence or honesty. No one\u2019s memoir is singled out as a fault.\n\n2. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cimpeachment leverage\u201d position is contradicted by multiple entries showing \u201cMinuses\u201d for impeachment efforts:  \n   a. Rep. Bob Barr (Slate rating 0) has the explicit minus <quote> Unapologetically vicious, partisan, and unforgiving in his impeachment quest. </quote> That is by definition \u201cleveraging the scandal\u201d for partisan gain.  \n   b. Kenneth Starr (Slate rating +1) is assigned the minus <invalid_quote> \u201cSeems merciless toward Clinton\u2026 too willing to provoke constitutional standoffs.\u201d </invalid_quote> Impeachment requires that \u201cconstitutional standoff.\u201d  \n   c. By contrast, Rep. Henry Hyde (Slate rating +4) is praised precisely because he \u201cprevented\u2026 jumping the gun on impeachment,\u201d implying that aggressive impeachment pursuit is blameworthy. Slate explicitly rewards restraint.  \n   d. If impeachment were \u201cnever listed\u201d as a minus, Barr and Starr would not bear those specific criticisms.\n\n3. Debater_A\u2019s core errors and misreadings:  \n   a. Selective \u201cPlus\u201d citations for Starr ignore his own minus for zeal. It is illogical to treat the \u201ccompelled by law\u201d plus as outweighing a clearly stated minus, when Slate\u2019s net rating for Starr is only +1. That low net reflects ambivalence, not unqualified praise.  \n   b. Misinterprets \u201cconsistent\u201d impeachment advocacy as a plus (\u201cconsistency\u201d is valued only when coupled with loyalty and silence; Barr\u2019s \u201cconsistency\u201d earns a neutral 0, not a plus). Consistency alone is not praiseworthy if it entails partisanship.  \n   c. Conflates \u201caccountability\u201d with \u201cvicious partisanship.\u201d Slate\u2019s language\u2014\u201cvicious, partisan, and unforgiving\u201d\u2014denounces an exploitative motive, not genuine justice. The same zeal is praised in Starr\u2019s legal duty only as a grudging obligation, not enthusiasm for impeachment.  \n   d. Fails to address the retrospective nature of memoirs. Slate\u2019s scorecard ends with \u201cMore Flytrap\u2026\u201d indicating additional events are outside its scope; yet no memo entries appear, showing irrelevance to Slate\u2019s moral calculus.\n\n4. Logical consistency:  \n   a. Slate\u2019s stated purpose (\u201cmoral recalibration\u201d) weighs personal loyalty and professional duty during a live crisis more heavily than subsequent self-examining publications. Memoirs pose no ongoing national risk.  \n   b. If \u201cmemoir profit motive\u201d were disqualifying, Slate would penalize all who \u201cblabbed\u201d or \u201cspun\u201d their stories post\u2010scandal\u2014yet many players (e.g., Secret Service, Chelsea Clinton) never face such criticism despite extensive media engagement.\n\nConclusion: \u201cUsed the scandal as leverage to attempt impeachment\u201d is explicitly condemned as a minus in multiple entries. \u201cWrote two memoirs for profit\u201d is not. Therefore the correct answer to the judge is \u201cWrote two memoirs for profit as a result of the scandal.\u201d\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
