    "background_text": "Reading the Inaugurals \n\n         President Clinton's Inaugural Address this month is the 53 rd in the series that began in 1789. All are worth a read--not just the highlights, such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and FDR. They will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian of 1997 looking back at 1837 or 1897 but as an ordinary citizen who shares--and is limited by--the information, the concerns, and the values of those times. (Thanks to Columbia University, all the addresses can be found on the Web.) \n\n         Among all the past presidents and their speech writers there was only one literary genius: Lincoln. After 132 years, his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood. None of the other inaugural addresses are in that league. But by and large they are dignified and intelligent speeches given by articulate men, each in touch with his times and aware that his inauguration was the most solemn occasion of his life. \n\n         The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases. The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. This classification is not waterproof. Theodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase and Warren G. Harding-Calvin Coolidge-Herbert Hoover in the second. But the trend is clear. \n\n         On picking up Washington's first inaugural, one is immediately struck by the modesty. He had just been elected unanimously by the Electoral College. He was more respected than any subsequent president has been at the time of his inauguration. And what does he say? \n\n                         [T]he magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with despondence one who (inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies.              \n\n          None of his successors has made the point as forcefully as that. But echoes are to be found in almost every president for the next 68 years. (John Adams was an exception. He was apparently so envious of Washington that he spent a large part of his address spelling out his own excellent qualifications for the job.) That era ended with Lincoln. Subsequent inaugurals routinely contain protestations of humility, but they are perfunctory and do not sound sincere. \n\n         The antebellum modesty, while in part a reflection of the conventional etiquette of the time, may also have served a political objective: to alleviate the concerns of those who--in the early days of the republic--feared it might be transformed into a monarchy, and the president into a king. A little later, perhaps after 1820, a new worry arose. Would the power of the federal government be used to interfere with the \"peculiar domestic institution\" of the Southern states? The presidents' assurance of the limitation of their powers may have been intended to give comfort to those states. \n\n         Lincoln faced a different situation. With the South already seceding, he could only \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution\" by asserting the power of the federal government and his own power as chief executive. It was no time for modesty. Lincoln's successors inherited a federal government with much more authority--and more need to use it--than before the war, and they had less motivation to belittle themselves and their powers. \n\n         In the third phase, the Inaugural Address metamorphosed from describing the government's policy to inspiring the public's behavior. Presidents recognized--or, at least, believed--that the country had problems they ought to deal with but could not manage by using the instruments of government alone. Thus, in his first inaugural, Woodrow Wilson said: \"At last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole. We see the bad with the good, the debased and decadent with the sound and the vital. With this vision we approach new affairs.\" \n\n         If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government. Similar diagnoses and prescriptions appear in later inaugurals. \n\n          Presidents derived their license to serve as leader-preacher from Theodore Roosevelt's remark that the presidency was \"a bully pulpit,\" a remark that did not appear in his Inaugural Address. The metaphor of the pulpit suggests not reading but oral and visual contact between the preacher and his flock. Radio and--even more--television made this possible on a national scale. A telltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural is the use of the phrase, \"Let us ... \"--meaning, \"You do as I say.\" This expression appears occasionally throughout the history of inaugurals, but it has hit its stride in recent years. John F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times in his Inaugural Address, and Richard Nixon has it 22 times in his second one. \n\n         The change in literary style from classical to colloquial can be demonstrated by one statistic. In all the inaugurals from Washington through James Buchanan, the average number of words per sentence was 44. From Lincoln to Wilson it was 34, and since Wilson it has been 25. I do not consider this a deterioration (this article has an average of 17 words per sentence), but it does reflect the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication. William Henry Harrison could talk about the governments of Athens, Rome, and the Helvetic Confederacy and expect his audience to know what he was talking about. That wouldn't be true today. But Harrison's audience would not have known what the Internet was. \n\n         Presidents and their speech writers have mined their predecessors for memorable words and repeated them without attribution. Kennedy's trumpet call, \"Ask not what your country can do for you: Ask what you can do for your country,\" has an ironic history. In his inaugural, Harding, surely no model for Kennedy, had said, \"Our most dangerous tendency is to expect too little of government, and at the same time do for it too little.\" And even before he became president, in a speech in 1916, Harding had said, \"In the great fulfillment we must have a citizenship less concerned about what the government can do for it and more anxious about what it can do for the nation.\" \n\n         Many an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more. That includes the Indians, the coastal fortifications, territorial expansion, the Isthmus Canal, civil-service reform, polygamy, and Prohibition. Some subjects that you expect to appear, don't. Hoover's inaugural, March 4, 1929, gives no hint of economic vulnerability. Roosevelt's second inaugural, Jan. 20, 1937, contains no reference to Hitler or to Germany. But what is most amazing, at least to a reader in 1997, is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women. The word \"women\" does not appear at all until Wilson's first inaugural, and it always appears as part of the phrase \"men and women,\" never as referring to any special concerns of women. Even Harding, the first president to be chosen in an election in which women voted nationally, does not remark on the uniqueness of the fact in his inaugural. \n\n          One subject that does get ample treatment is taxes. \"Taxes,\" or some equivalent word, appears in 43 of the 52 inaugural addresses to date. Coolidge said in 1925: \"The time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction. ... I am opposed to extremely high rates, because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for the country, and, finally, because they are wrong.\" Federal taxes were then about 3 percent of the gross domestic product. Ronald Reagan said essentially the same thing in 1981, when they were 20 percent. \n\n         The most disturbing aspect of the whole series of inaugurals is what is said and unsaid on the subject of race relations, which Arthur Schlesinger Jr. calls \"the supreme American problem.\" The words \"black,\" \"blacks,\" \"Negro,\" or \"race\" (as applied to blacks) do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes, 1877. James Monroe asked in 1817, \"On whom has oppression fallen in any quarter of our Union? Who has been deprived of any right of person or property?\" These were rhetorical questions, intended to get the answer \"No one!\"--as if there were not millions of slaves in America. \n\n         Before the Civil War the word \"slavery\" appears only in the Inaugural Address of Martin Van Buren, 1837, and Buchanan, 1857, and then only as something that, pursuant to the Constitution and in order to preserve the Union, should not be interfered with. But although generally unmentionable, the subject was boiling, and would boil over in 1861. After the Civil War, it is in the inaugurals of Hayes, James Garfield (1881), and Benjamin Harrison (1889) that we find the most explicit and positive discussion of the need to convert into reality the rights and freedom granted to the \"freedmen\" on paper by the 13 th , 14 th , and 15 th amendments. Garfield's was the strongest among these. (He had been a student at Williams College in the 1850s, 80 years before me, when the college had been a station on the underground railway.) But the subject then began to fade. William McKinley said in his first Inaugural Address, March 4, 1897, \"Lynchings must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the United States,\" but he said it without horror. Taft raised the subject of race relations in 1909 only to express satisfaction at the progress that had been made. And then the subject disappeared. FDR never mentioned it in any of his four inaugurals. \n\n         After World War II the subject came back to inaugural addresses, but in a weak and abstract form. That is true even of the presidents we think of as being most concerned with race relations in America--like Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, and Bill Clinton. Perhaps each thought he had made a sufficient statement by having a black woman--Marian Anderson, Leontyne Price, or Maya Angelou--perform at his ceremony. In Clinton's first inaugural, the only allusion to the race problem is in this sentence: \"From our revolution, the Civil War, to the Great Depression to the civil rights movement, our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history.\" I recall this not to suggest that their concern was not deep and sincere, but only to indicate what is acceptable to say in a speech intended to appeal to the values shared by Americans. \n\n         There is much more to ponder in these speeches than I have suggested here. There is much to be proud of, in what we have endured and achieved, in the peaceful transference of power, and in the reasonableness and moderation of the presidents we have elected. But there is also much humility to be learned. We look back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness revealed by what our past leaders have said and our past citizens believed. We should recognize that 50 or 100 years from now, readers will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today. \n\n          \n\n            POSTSCRIPT: To read Herbert Stein's analysis of President Clinton's second Inaugural Address, click .\n",

I am opposed to extremely high rates, because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for the country, and, finally, because they are wrong.\" Federal taxes were then about 3 percent of the gross domestic product. Ronald Reagan said essentially the same thing in 1981, when they were 20 percent. \n\n         The most disturbing aspect of the whole series of inaugurals is what is said and unsaid on the subject of race relations, which Arthur Schlesinger Jr. calls \"the supreme American problem.\" The words \"black,\" \"blacks,\" \"Negro,\" or \"race\" (as applied to blacks) do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes, 1877. James Monroe asked in 1817, \"On whom has oppression fallen in any quarter of our Union? Who has been deprived of any right of person or property?\" These were rhetorical questions, intended to get the answer \"No one!\"--as if there were not millions of slaves in America. \n\n         Before the Civil War the word \"slavery\" appears only in the Inaugural Address of Martin Van Buren, 1837, and Buchanan, 1857, and then only as something that, pursuant to the Constitution and in order to preserve the Union, should not be interfered with. But although generally unmentionable, the subject was boiling, and would boil over in 1861. After the Civil War, it is in the inaugurals of Hayes, James Garfield (1881), and Benjamin Harrison (1889) that we find the most explicit and positive discussion of the need to convert into reality the rights and freedom granted to the \"freedmen\" on paper by the 13 th , 14 th , and 15 th amendments. Garfield's was the strongest among these. (He had been a student at Williams College in the 1850s, 80 years before me, when the college had been a station on the underground railway.) But the subject then began to fade. William McKinley said in his first Inaugural Address, March 4, 1897, \"Lynchings must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the United States,\" but he said it without horror. Taft raised the subject of race relations in 1909 only to express satisfaction at the progress that had been made. And then the subject disappeared. FDR never mentioned it in any of his four inaugurals. \n\n         After World War II the subject came back to inaugural addresses, but in a weak and abstract form. That is true even of the presidents we think of as being most concerned with race relations in America--like Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, and Bill Clinton. Perhaps each thought he had made a sufficient statement by having a black woman--Marian Anderson, Leontyne Price, or Maya Angelou--perform at his ceremony. In Clinton's first inaugural, the only allusion to the race problem is in this sentence: \"From our revolution, the Civil War, to the Great Depression to the civil rights movement, our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history.\" I recall this not to suggest that their concern was not deep and sincere, but only to indicate what is acceptable to say in a speech intended to appeal to the values shared by Americans. \n\n         There is much more to ponder in these speeches than I have suggested here. There is much to be proud of, in what we have endured and achieved, in the peaceful transference of power, and in the reasonableness and moderation of the presidents we have elected. But there is also much humility to be learned. We look back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness revealed by what our past leaders have said and our past citizens believed.

All are worth a read--not just the highlights, such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and FDR. They will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian of 1997 looking back at 1837 or 1897 but as an ordinary citizen who shares--and is limited by--the information, the concerns, and the values of those times. (Thanks to Columbia University, all the addresses can be found on the Web.) \n\n         Among all the past presidents and their speech writers there was only one literary genius: Lincoln. After 132 years, his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood. None of the other inaugural addresses are in that league. But by and large they are dignified and intelligent speeches given by articulate men, each in touch with his times and aware that his inauguration was the most solemn occasion of his life. \n\n         The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases. The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. This classification is not waterproof. Theodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase and Warren G. Harding-Calvin Coolidge-Herbert Hoover in the second. But the trend is clear. \n\n         On picking up Washington's first inaugural, one is immediately struck by the modesty. He had just been elected unanimously by the Electoral College. He was more respected than any subsequent president has been at the time of his inauguration. And what does he say? \n\n                         [T]he magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with despondence one who (inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies.              \n\n          None of his successors has made the point as forcefully as that. But echoes are to be found in almost every president for the next 68 years. (John Adams was an exception. He was apparently so envious of Washington that he spent a large part of his address spelling out his own excellent qualifications for the job.) That era ended with Lincoln. Subsequent inaugurals routinely contain protestations of humility, but they are perfunctory and do not sound sincere. \n\n         The antebellum modesty, while in part a reflection of the conventional etiquette of the time, may also have served a political objective: to alleviate the concerns of those who--in the early days of the republic--feared it might be transformed into a monarchy, and the president into a king. A little later, perhaps after 1820, a new worry arose. Would the power of the federal government be used to interfere with the \"peculiar domestic institution\" of the Southern states? The presidents' assurance of the limitation of their powers may have been intended to give comfort to those states. \n\n         Lincoln faced a different situation. With the South already seceding, he could only \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution\" by asserting the power of the federal government and his own power as chief executive. It was no time for modesty. Lincoln's successors inherited a federal government with much more authority--and more need to use it--than before the war, and they had less motivation to belittle themselves and their powers. \n\n         In the third phase, the Inaugural Address metamorphosed from describing the government's policy to inspiring the public's behavior. Presidents recognized--or, at least, believed--that the country had problems they ought to deal with but could not manage by using the instruments of government alone. Thus, in his first inaugural, Woodrow Wilson said: \"At last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole. We see the bad with the good, the debased and decadent with the sound and the vital. With this vision we approach new affairs.\" \n\n         If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government. Similar diagnoses and prescriptions appear in later inaugurals. \n\n          Presidents derived their license to serve as leader-preacher from Theodore Roosevelt's remark that the presidency was \"a bully pulpit,\" a remark that did not appear in his Inaugural Address. The metaphor of the pulpit suggests not reading but oral and visual contact between the preacher and his flock. Radio and--even more--television made this possible on a national scale. A telltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural is the use of the phrase, \"Let us ... \"--meaning, \"You do as I say.\" This expression appears occasionally throughout the history of inaugurals, but it has hit its stride in recent years. John F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times in his Inaugural Address, and Richard Nixon has it 22 times in his second one. \n\n         The change in literary style from classical to colloquial can be demonstrated by one statistic. In all the inaugurals from Washington through James Buchanan, the average number of words per sentence was 44. From Lincoln to Wilson it was 34, and since Wilson it has been 25. I do not consider this a deterioration (this article has an average of 17 words per sentence), but it does reflect the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication. William Henry Harrison could talk about the governments of Athens, Rome, and the Helvetic Confederacy and expect his audience to know what he was talking about. That wouldn't be true today. But Harrison's audience would not have known what the Internet was. \n\n         Presidents and their speech writers have mined their predecessors for memorable words and repeated them without attribution. Kennedy's trumpet call, \"Ask not what your country can do for you: Ask what you can do for your country,\" has an ironic history. In his inaugural, Harding, surely no model for Kennedy, had said, \"Our most dangerous tendency is to expect too little of government, and at the same time do for it too little.\" And even before he became president, in a speech in 1916, Harding had said, \"In the great fulfillment we must have a citizenship less concerned about what the government can do for it and more anxious about what it can do for the nation.\" \n\n         Many an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more. That includes the Indians, the coastal fortifications, territorial expansion, the Isthmus Canal, civil-service reform, polygamy, and Prohibition. Some subjects that you expect to appear, don't. Hoover's inaugural, March 4, 1929, gives no hint of economic vulnerability. Roosevelt's second inaugural, Jan. 20, 1937, contains no reference to Hitler or to Germany. But what is most amazing, at least to a reader in 1997, is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women. The word \"women\" does not appear at all until Wilson's first inaugural, and it always appears as part of the phrase \"men and women,\" never as referring to any special concerns of women. Even Harding, the first president to be chosen in an election in which women voted nationally, does not remark on the uniqueness of the fact in his inaugural. \n\n          One subject that does get ample treatment is taxes. \"Taxes,\" or some equivalent word, appears in 43 of the 52 inaugural addresses to date. Coolidge said in 1925: \"The time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction. ... I am opposed to extremely high rates, because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for the country, and, finally, because they are wrong.\" Federal taxes were then about 3 percent of the gross domestic product. Ronald Reagan said essentially the same thing in 1981, when they were 20 percent. \n\n         The most disturbing aspect of the whole series of inaugurals is what is said and unsaid on the subject of race relations, which Arthur Schlesinger Jr. calls \"the supreme American problem.\" The words \"black,\" \"blacks,\" \"Negro,\" or \"race\" (as applied to blacks) do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes, 1877. James Monroe asked in 1817, \"On whom has oppression fallen in any quarter of our Union? Who has been deprived of any right of person or property?\" These were rhetorical questions, intended to get the answer \"No one!\"--as if there were not millions of slaves in America. \n\n         Before the Civil War the word \"slavery\" appears only in the Inaugural Address of Martin Van Buren, 1837, and Buchanan, 1857, and then only as something that, pursuant to the Constitution and in order to preserve the Union, should not be interfered with. But although generally unmentionable, the subject was boiling, and would boil over in 1861. After the Civil War, it is in the inaugurals of Hayes, James Garfield (1881), and Benjamin Harrison (1889) that we find the most explicit and positive discussion of the need to convert into reality the rights and freedom granted to the \"freedmen\" on paper by the 13 th , 14 th , and 15 th amendments. Garfield's was the strongest among these. (He had been a student at Williams College in the 1850s, 80 years before me, when the college had been a station on the underground railway.) But the subject then began to fade. William McKinley said in his first Inaugural Address, March 4, 1897, \"Lynchings must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the United States,\" but he said it without horror. Taft raised the subject of race relations in 1909 only to express satisfaction at the progress that had been made. And then the subject disappeared. FDR never mentioned it in any of his four inaugurals. \n\n         After World War II the subject came back to inaugural addresses, but in a weak and abstract form. That is true even of the presidents we think of as being most concerned with race relations in America--like Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, and Bill Clinton. Perhaps each thought he had made a sufficient statement by having a black woman--Marian Anderson, Leontyne Price, or Maya Angelou--perform at his ceremony. In Clinton's first inaugural, the only allusion to the race problem is in this sentence: \"From our revolution, the Civil War, to the Great Depression to the civil rights movement, our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history.\" I recall this not to suggest that their concern was not deep and sincere, but only to indicate what is acceptable to say in a speech intended to appeal to the values shared by Americans. \n\n         There is much more to ponder in these speeches than I have suggested here. There is much to be proud of, in what we have endured and achieved, in the peaceful transference of power, and in the reasonableness and moderation of the presidents we have elected. But there is also much humility to be learned. We look back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness revealed by what our past leaders have said and our past citizens believed.

All are worth a read--not just the highlights, such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and FDR. They will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian of 1997 looking back at 1837 or 1897 but as an ordinary citizen who shares--and is limited by--the information, the concerns, and the values of those times. (Thanks to Columbia University, all the addresses can be found on the Web.) \n\n         Among all the past presidents and their speech writers there was only one literary genius: Lincoln. After 132 years, his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood. None of the other inaugural addresses are in that league. But by and large they are dignified and intelligent speeches given by articulate men, each in touch with his times and aware that his inauguration was the most solemn occasion of his life. \n\n         The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases. The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. This classification is not waterproof. Theodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase and Warren G. Harding-Calvin Coolidge-Herbert Hoover in the second. But the trend is clear. \n\n         On picking up Washington's first inaugural, one is immediately struck by the modesty. He had just been elected unanimously by the Electoral College. He was more respected than any subsequent president has been at the time of his inauguration. And what does he say? \n\n                         [T]he magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with despondence one who (inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies.              \n\n          None of his successors has made the point as forcefully as that. But echoes are to be found in almost every president for the next 68 years. (John Adams was an exception. He was apparently so envious of Washington that he spent a large part of his address spelling out his own excellent qualifications for the job.) That era ended with Lincoln. Subsequent inaugurals routinely contain protestations of humility, but they are perfunctory and do not sound sincere. \n\n         The antebellum modesty, while in part a reflection of the conventional etiquette of the time, may also have served a political objective: to alleviate the concerns of those who--in the early days of the republic--feared it might be transformed into a monarchy, and the president into a king. A little later, perhaps after 1820, a new worry arose. Would the power of the federal government be used to interfere with the \"peculiar domestic institution\" of the Southern states? The presidents' assurance of the limitation of their powers may have been intended to give comfort to those states. \n\n         Lincoln faced a different situation. With the South already seceding, he could only \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution\" by asserting the power of the federal government and his own power as chief executive. It was no time for modesty. Lincoln's successors inherited a federal government with much more authority--and more need to use it--than before the war, and they had less motivation to belittle themselves and their powers. \n\n         In the third phase, the Inaugural Address metamorphosed from describing the government's policy to inspiring the public's behavior. Presidents recognized--or, at least, believed--that the country had problems they ought to deal with but could not manage by using the instruments of government alone. Thus, in his first inaugural, Woodrow Wilson said: \"At last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole. We see the bad with the good, the debased and decadent with the sound and the vital. With this vision we approach new affairs.\" \n\n         If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government. Similar diagnoses and prescriptions appear in later inaugurals. \n\n          Presidents derived their license to serve as leader-preacher from Theodore Roosevelt's remark that the presidency was \"a bully pulpit,\" a remark that did not appear in his Inaugural Address. The metaphor of the pulpit suggests not reading but oral and visual contact between the preacher and his flock. Radio and--even more--television made this possible on a national scale. A telltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural is the use of the phrase, \"Let us ... \"--meaning, \"You do as I say.\" This expression appears occasionally throughout the history of inaugurals, but it has hit its stride in recent years. John F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times in his Inaugural Address, and Richard Nixon has it 22 times in his second one. \n\n         The change in literary style from classical to colloquial can be demonstrated by one statistic. In all the inaugurals from Washington through James Buchanan, the average number of words per sentence was 44. From Lincoln to Wilson it was 34, and since Wilson it has been 25. I do not consider this a deterioration (this article has an average of 17 words per sentence), but it does reflect the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication. William Henry Harrison could talk about the governments of Athens, Rome, and the Helvetic Confederacy and expect his audience to know what he was talking about. That wouldn't be true today. But Harrison's audience would not have known what the Internet was. \n\n         Presidents and their speech writers have mined their predecessors for memorable words and repeated them without attribution. Kennedy's trumpet call, \"Ask not what your country can do for you: Ask what you can do for your country,\" has an ironic history. In his inaugural, Harding, surely no model for Kennedy, had said, \"Our most dangerous tendency is to expect too little of government, and at the same time do for it too little.\" And even before he became president, in a speech in 1916, Harding had said, \"In the great fulfillment we must have a citizenship less concerned about what the government can do for it and more anxious about what it can do for the nation.\" \n\n         Many an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more. That includes the Indians, the coastal fortifications, territorial expansion, the Isthmus Canal, civil-service reform, polygamy, and Prohibition. Some subjects that you expect to appear, don't. Hoover's inaugural, March 4, 1929, gives no hint of economic vulnerability. Roosevelt's second inaugural, Jan. 20, 1937, contains no reference to Hitler or to Germany. But what is most amazing, at least to a reader in 1997, is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women. The word \"women\" does not appear at all until Wilson's first inaugural, and it always appears as part of the phrase \"men and women,\" never as referring to any special concerns of women. Even Harding, the first president to be chosen in an election in which women voted nationally, does not remark on the uniqueness of the fact in his inaugural. \n\n          One subject that does get ample treatment is taxes. \"Taxes,\" or some equivalent word, appears in 43 of the 52 inaugural addresses to date. Coolidge said in 1925: \"The time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction. ... I am opposed to extremely high rates, because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for the country, and, finally, because they are wrong.\" Federal taxes were then about 3 percent of the gross domestic product. Ronald Reagan said essentially the same thing in 1981, when they were 20 percent. \n\n         The most disturbing aspect of the whole series of inaugurals is what is said and unsaid on the subject of race relations, which Arthur Schlesinger Jr. calls \"the supreme American problem.\" The words \"black,\" \"blacks,\" \"Negro,\" or \"race\" (as applied to blacks) do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes, 1877. James Monroe asked in 1817, \"On whom has oppression fallen in any quarter of our Union? Who has been deprived of any right of person or property?\" These were rhetorical questions, intended to get the answer \"No one!\"--as if there were not millions of slaves in America. \n\n         Before the Civil War the word \"slavery\" appears only in the Inaugural Address of Martin Van Buren, 1837, and Buchanan, 1857, and then only as something that, pursuant to the Constitution and in order to preserve the Union, should not be interfered with. But although generally unmentionable, the subject was boiling, and would boil over in 1861. After the Civil War, it is in the inaugurals of Hayes, James Garfield (1881), and Benjamin Harrison (1889) that we find the most explicit and positive discussion of the need to convert into reality the rights and freedom granted to the \"freedmen\" on paper by the 13 th , 14 th , and 15 th amendments. Garfield's was the strongest among these. (He had been a student at Williams College in the 1850s, 80 years before me, when the college had been a station on the underground railway.) But the subject then began to fade. William McKinley said in his first Inaugural Address, March 4, 1897, \"Lynchings must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the United States,\" but he said it without horror. Taft raised the subject of race relations in 1909 only to express satisfaction at the progress that had been made. And then the subject disappeared. FDR never mentioned it in any of his four inaugurals. \n\n         After World War II the subject came back to inaugural addresses, but in a weak and abstract form. That is true even of the presidents we think of as being most concerned with race relations in America--like Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, and Bill Clinton. Perhaps each thought he had made a sufficient statement by having a black woman--Marian Anderson, Leontyne Price, or Maya Angelou--perform at his ceremony. In Clinton's first inaugural, the only allusion to the race problem is in this sentence: \"From our revolution, the Civil War, to the Great Depression to the civil rights movement, our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history.\" I recall this not to suggest that their concern was not deep and sincere, but only to indicate what is acceptable to say in a speech intended to appeal to the values shared by Americans. \n\n         There is much more to ponder in these speeches than I have suggested here. There is much to be proud of, in what we have endured and achieved, in the peaceful transference of power, and in the reasonableness and moderation of the presidents we have elected. But there is also much humility to be learned. We look back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness revealed by what our past leaders have said and our past citizens believed. We should recognize that 50 or 100 years from now, readers will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today. \n\n          \n\n            POSTSCRIPT: To read Herbert Stein's analysis of President Clinton's second Inaugural Address, click .\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is the author\u2019s overall thesis about inaugural speeches?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"They present a snapshot of the views and beliefs of their time\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"They are a cryptic way to interpret history\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"They are a cryptic way to interpret history\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My thesis is that inaugural speeches function as a \u201ccryptic way to interpret history,\u201d not merely passive snapshots of contemporary views.  \n   A. The author repeatedly invites readers to look beyond the surface: \u201cThere is much more to ponder in these speeches than I have suggested here\u201d and warns that \u201c50 or 100 years from now, readers will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today\u201d <quote>There is much more to ponder</quote>. If inaugurals were simple snapshots, there would be no need for this interpretive caution or expectation of future perspective shifts.  \n   B. The emphasis on \u201cwhat is said and unsaid,\u201d especially on sensitive issues like race and women, shows the author treats inaugurals as cryptic texts requiring decoding to reveal the moral blind spots of each era. He notes \u201cthe silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women\u201d and the periodic disappearance and reappearance of \u201crace\u201d <quote>The word \"women\" does not appear</quote> and <quote>the subject then began to fade.</quote>. A mere snapshot would not highlight omissions; cryptic texts do.  \n   C. The three-phase classification (\u201cmodest public servant,\u201d \u201cprosaic executive,\u201d \u201cleader-preacher\u201d) is itself an interpretive framework that reads inaugurals as symbolic indicators of evolving presidential self-conceptions and national needs <invalid_quote>\u201cThe stance and style \u2026 seem to have gone through three phases\u201d</invalid_quote>. One must interpret rhetorical style changes (e.g., average sentence length, use of \u201cLet us\u2026\u201d) as coded signals, not as inert reflections.  \n2. Debater_B\u2019s \u201csnapshot\u201d thesis is inadequate:  \n   A. It ignores the author\u2019s focus on prophetic and prescriptive uses of inaugurals. For example, Wilson\u2019s inaugural \u201cvision\u201d of national character anticipates moral transformation beyond government action <quote> If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people,</quote>. A snapshot implies passivity; these speeches actively seek to shape future behavior, indicating symbolic and cryptic power.  \n   B. A snapshot thesis cannot explain the author\u2019s insistence that inaugurals both reveal \u201cwhat our past leaders have said and our past citizens believed\u201d and teach \u201chumility\u201d by comparison with future standards <invalid_quote>\u201cWe should recognize that \u2026 readers will shake their heads\u201d</invalid_quote>. That humility arises only when one interprets cryptic omissions and muted language as evidence of moral \u201cignorance and obtuseness,\u201d not simple reportage.  \n   C. If inaugurals were only descriptive, why does the author mine their language for re-used metaphors (e.g., \u201cbully pulpit\u201d), tracing how presidents \u201cderived their license\u201d <quote> Presidents derived their license to</quote>? This genealogy treats speeches as coded instruments in an ongoing dialogue, not static images.  \n3. Conclusion: The author\u2019s consistent attention to omissions, evolving rhetorical codes, prescriptive elements, and the need for future reinterpretation compels viewing inaugural addresses as cryptic texts that require decoding to understand both their own era and ours. The \u201csnapshot\u201d view collapses these rich interpretive demands into mere decoration. Therefore, my position best captures the author\u2019s overall thesis.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cSnapshots of Their Time\u201d  (Debater_B)\n\n1. Direct Statement of Purpose  \n  a. The author explicitly recommends reading all inaugurals \u201cto give you a feeling of being there\u2026limited by\u2026the information, the concerns, and the values of those times\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cThey will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian\u2026limited by\u2026the concerns, and the values of those times.\u201d</invalid_quote>.  \n  b. If inaugurals were \u201ccryptic,\u201d this transparent explanation is inexplicable; the author treats them as primary historical sources.  \n\n2. Classification by Historical Phases  \n  a. The three \u201cphases\u201d of inaugural style (modest public servant; prosaic executive; theatrical leader-preacher) track evolving political contexts and media technologies <quote> But the trend is clear. </quote>.  \n  b. The shift at Lincoln reflects Civil War exigencies, not hidden symbolism: \u201cLincoln\u2026could only\u2026assert the power\u2026It was no time for modesty\u201d <quote> It was no time for modesty. </quote>. This literal reading undermines a \u201ccryptic\u201d thesis.  \n\n3. Topical Choices Reflect Contemporary Preoccupations  \n  a. Frequent mention of \u201ctaxes\u201d in 52 of 53 addresses shows an enduring fiscal concern, varying with economic context (3% to 20% GDP) <invalid_quote>\u201c\u2018Taxes\u2019\u2026appears in 43 of the 52 inaugural addresses\u2026Coolidge\u2026Reagan said essentially the same thing.\u201d</invalid_quote>.  \n  b. Silence or mention of race, women, war, and technology reveals social taboos and pressing issues. For example, \u201cwomen\u201d absent until 1913; \u201cslavery\u201d unmentionable before 1861; race returns abstractly post\u2013WWII when public opinion shifts <invalid_quote>\u201cThe word \u2018women\u2019 does not appear\u2026until Wilson\u2026\u2018race\u2019\u2026not appear\u2026until\u20261877.\u201d</invalid_quote>.  \n\n4. Literary Style and Audience Changes  \n  a. Sentence-length decline (44\u219234\u219225 words) correlates with broader, less classical audience and new media (radio/TV). This pragmatic adaptation is characteristic, not cryptic <invalid_quote>\u201cI do not consider this a deterioration\u2026but\u2026it does reflect the change in\u2026the audience and\u2026communication.\u201d</invalid_quote>.  \n  b. Use of \u201cLet us\u2026\u201d multiplies as presidents seek to \u201cuplift the people\u201d when government tools alone are insufficient\u2014again, a clear strategy, not hidden meaning.  \n\n5. Counterargument: Not a \u201cCryptic\u201d Code  \n  a. If inaugurals were cryptic, why would presidents plagiarize memorable lines without attribution? \u201cAsk not\u2026\u201d echoes Harding\u2019s earlier plain exhortations <invalid_quote>\u201cIn his inaugural, Harding\u2026\u2018less concerned about what the government can do\u2026\u2019\u201d</invalid_quote>. The author treats this as literary \u201cmining,\u201d not ciphering.  \n  b. The author repeatedly laments \u201cwhat is said and unsaid\u201d as evidence of moral obtuseness and ignorance, urging humility about our own era. A \u201ccryptic\u201d thesis cannot square with the author\u2019s frank moral judgments.  \n\nConclusion  \n  The author\u2019s recurring emphasis on context, style evolution, topic inclusion/omission, and transparent moral evaluation confirms that inaugurals serve as plain \u201csnapshots\u201d of contemporary beliefs and constraints. The \u201ccryptic interpretation\u201d theory conflicts with the author\u2019s explicit methodology and fails to explain his detailed content analyses.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"They are a cryptic way to interpret history\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

All are worth a read--not just the highlights, such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and FDR. They will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian of 1997 looking back at 1837 or 1897 but as an ordinary citizen who shares--and is limited by--the information, the concerns, and the values of those times. (Thanks to Columbia University, all the addresses can be found on the Web.) \n\n         Among all the past presidents and their speech writers there was only one literary genius: Lincoln. After 132 years, his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood. None of the other inaugural addresses are in that league. But by and large they are dignified and intelligent speeches given by articulate men, each in touch with his times and aware that his inauguration was the most solemn occasion of his life. \n\n         The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases. The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. This classification is not waterproof. Theodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase and Warren G. Harding-Calvin Coolidge-Herbert Hoover in the second. But the trend is clear. \n\n         On picking up Washington's first inaugural, one is immediately struck by the modesty. He had just been elected unanimously by the Electoral College. He was more respected than any subsequent president has been at the time of his inauguration. And what does he say? \n\n                         [T]he magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with despondence one who (inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies.              \n\n          None of his successors has made the point as forcefully as that. But echoes are to be found in almost every president for the next 68 years. (John Adams was an exception. He was apparently so envious of Washington that he spent a large part of his address spelling out his own excellent qualifications for the job.) That era ended with Lincoln. Subsequent inaugurals routinely contain protestations of humility, but they are perfunctory and do not sound sincere. \n\n         The antebellum modesty, while in part a reflection of the conventional etiquette of the time, may also have served a political objective: to alleviate the concerns of those who--in the early days of the republic--feared it might be transformed into a monarchy, and the president into a king. A little later, perhaps after 1820, a new worry arose. Would the power of the federal government be used to interfere with the \"peculiar domestic institution\" of the Southern states? The presidents' assurance of the limitation of their powers may have been intended to give comfort to those states. \n\n         Lincoln faced a different situation. With the South already seceding, he could only \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution\" by asserting the power of the federal government and his own power as chief executive. It was no time for modesty. Lincoln's successors inherited a federal government with much more authority--and more need to use it--than before the war, and they had less motivation to belittle themselves and their powers. \n\n         In the third phase, the Inaugural Address metamorphosed from describing the government's policy to inspiring the public's behavior. Presidents recognized--or, at least, believed--that the country had problems they ought to deal with but could not manage by using the instruments of government alone. Thus, in his first inaugural, Woodrow Wilson said: \"At last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole. We see the bad with the good, the debased and decadent with the sound and the vital. With this vision we approach new affairs.\" \n\n         If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government. Similar diagnoses and prescriptions appear in later inaugurals. \n\n          Presidents derived their license to serve as leader-preacher from Theodore Roosevelt's remark that the presidency was \"a bully pulpit,\" a remark that did not appear in his Inaugural Address. The metaphor of the pulpit suggests not reading but oral and visual contact between the preacher and his flock. Radio and--even more--television made this possible on a national scale. A telltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural is the use of the phrase, \"Let us ... \"--meaning, \"You do as I say.\" This expression appears occasionally throughout the history of inaugurals, but it has hit its stride in recent years. John F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times in his Inaugural Address, and Richard Nixon has it 22 times in his second one. \n\n         The change in literary style from classical to colloquial can be demonstrated by one statistic. In all the inaugurals from Washington through James Buchanan, the average number of words per sentence was 44. From Lincoln to Wilson it was 34, and since Wilson it has been 25. I do not consider this a deterioration (this article has an average of 17 words per sentence), but it does reflect the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication. William Henry Harrison could talk about the governments of Athens, Rome, and the Helvetic Confederacy and expect his audience to know what he was talking about. That wouldn't be true today. But Harrison's audience would not have known what the Internet was. \n\n         Presidents and their speech writers have mined their predecessors for memorable words and repeated them without attribution. Kennedy's trumpet call, \"Ask not what your country can do for you: Ask what you can do for your country,\" has an ironic history. In his inaugural, Harding, surely no model for Kennedy, had said, \"Our most dangerous tendency is to expect too little of government, and at the same time do for it too little.\" And even before he became president, in a speech in 1916, Harding had said, \"In the great fulfillment we must have a citizenship less concerned about what the government can do for it and more anxious about what it can do for the nation.\" \n\n         Many an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more. That includes the Indians, the coastal fortifications, territorial expansion, the Isthmus Canal, civil-service reform, polygamy, and Prohibition. Some subjects that you expect to appear, don't. Hoover's inaugural, March 4, 1929, gives no hint of economic vulnerability. Roosevelt's second inaugural, Jan. 20, 1937, contains no reference to Hitler or to Germany. But what is most amazing, at least to a reader in 1997, is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women. The word \"women\" does not appear at all until Wilson's first inaugural, and it always appears as part of the phrase \"men and women,\" never as referring to any special concerns of women. Even Harding, the first president to be chosen in an election in which women voted nationally, does not remark on the uniqueness of the fact in his inaugural. \n\n          One subject that does get ample treatment is taxes. \"Taxes,\" or some equivalent word, appears in 43 of the 52 inaugural addresses to date. Coolidge said in 1925: \"The time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction. ... I am opposed to extremely high rates, because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for the country, and, finally, because they are wrong.\" Federal taxes were then about 3 percent of the gross domestic product. Ronald Reagan said essentially the same thing in 1981, when they were 20 percent. \n\n         The most disturbing aspect of the whole series of inaugurals is what is said and unsaid on the subject of race relations, which Arthur Schlesinger Jr. calls \"the supreme American problem.\" The words \"black,\" \"blacks,\" \"Negro,\" or \"race\" (as applied to blacks) do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes, 1877. James Monroe asked in 1817, \"On whom has oppression fallen in any quarter of our Union? Who has been deprived of any right of person or property?\" These were rhetorical questions, intended to get the answer \"No one!\"--as if there were not millions of slaves in America. \n\n         Before the Civil War the word \"slavery\" appears only in the Inaugural Address of Martin Van Buren, 1837, and Buchanan, 1857, and then only as something that, pursuant to the Constitution and in order to preserve the Union, should not be interfered with. But although generally unmentionable, the subject was boiling, and would boil over in 1861. After the Civil War, it is in the inaugurals of Hayes, James Garfield (1881), and Benjamin Harrison (1889) that we find the most explicit and positive discussion of the need to convert into reality the rights and freedom granted to the \"freedmen\" on paper by the 13 th , 14 th , and 15 th amendments. Garfield's was the strongest among these. (He had been a student at Williams College in the 1850s, 80 years before me, when the college had been a station on the underground railway.) But the subject then began to fade. William McKinley said in his first Inaugural Address, March 4, 1897, \"Lynchings must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the United States,\" but he said it without horror. Taft raised the subject of race relations in 1909 only to express satisfaction at the progress that had been made. And then the subject disappeared. FDR never mentioned it in any of his four inaugurals. \n\n         After World War II the subject came back to inaugural addresses, but in a weak and abstract form. That is true even of the presidents we think of as being most concerned with race relations in America--like Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, and Bill Clinton. Perhaps each thought he had made a sufficient statement by having a black woman--Marian Anderson, Leontyne Price, or Maya Angelou--perform at his ceremony. In Clinton's first inaugural, the only allusion to the race problem is in this sentence: \"From our revolution, the Civil War, to the Great Depression to the civil rights movement, our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history.\" I recall this not to suggest that their concern was not deep and sincere, but only to indicate what is acceptable to say in a speech intended to appeal to the values shared by Americans. \n\n         There is much more to ponder in these speeches than I have suggested here. There is much to be proud of, in what we have endured and achieved, in the peaceful transference of power, and in the reasonableness and moderation of the presidents we have elected. But there is also much humility to be learned. We look back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness revealed by what our past leaders have said and our past citizens believed. We should recognize that 50 or 100 years from now, readers will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today. \n\n          \n\n            POSTSCRIPT: To read Herbert Stein's analysis of President Clinton's second Inaugural Address, click .\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is the author\u2019s overall thesis about inaugural speeches?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"They are a cryptic way to interpret history\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"They present a snapshot of the views and beliefs of their time\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"They present a snapshot of the views and beliefs of their time\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cSnapshots of Their Time\u201d  (Debater_B)\n\n1.

Therefore, my position best captures the author\u2019s overall thesis.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cSnapshots of Their Time\u201d  (Debater_B)\n\n1. Direct Statement of Purpose  \n  a. The author explicitly recommends reading all inaugurals \u201cto give you a feeling of being there\u2026limited by\u2026the information, the concerns, and the values of those times\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cThey will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian\u2026limited by\u2026the concerns, and the values of those times.\u201d</invalid_quote>.  \n  b. If inaugurals were \u201ccryptic,\u201d this transparent explanation is inexplicable; the author treats them as primary historical sources.  \n\n2. Classification by Historical Phases  \n  a. The three \u201cphases\u201d of inaugural style (modest public servant; prosaic executive; theatrical leader-preacher) track evolving political contexts and media technologies <quote> But the trend is clear. </quote>.  \n  b. The shift at Lincoln reflects Civil War exigencies, not hidden symbolism: \u201cLincoln\u2026could only\u2026assert the power\u2026It was no time for modesty\u201d <quote> It was no time for modesty. </quote>. This literal reading undermines a \u201ccryptic\u201d thesis.  \n\n3. Topical Choices Reflect Contemporary Preoccupations  \n  a. Frequent mention of \u201ctaxes\u201d in 52 of 53 addresses shows an enduring fiscal concern, varying with economic context (3% to 20% GDP) <invalid_quote>\u201c\u2018Taxes\u2019\u2026appears in 43 of the 52 inaugural addresses\u2026Coolidge\u2026Reagan said essentially the same thing.\u201d</invalid_quote>.  \n  b. Silence or mention of race, women, war, and technology reveals social taboos and pressing issues. For example, \u201cwomen\u201d absent until 1913; \u201cslavery\u201d unmentionable before 1861; race returns abstractly post\u2013WWII when public opinion shifts <invalid_quote>\u201cThe word \u2018women\u2019 does not appear\u2026until Wilson\u2026\u2018race\u2019\u2026not appear\u2026until\u20261877.\u201d</invalid_quote>.  \n\n4. Literary Style and Audience Changes  \n  a. Sentence-length decline (44\u219234\u219225 words) correlates with broader, less classical audience and new media (radio/TV). This pragmatic adaptation is characteristic, not cryptic <invalid_quote>\u201cI do not consider this a deterioration\u2026but\u2026it does reflect the change in\u2026the audience and\u2026communication.\u201d</invalid_quote>.  \n  b. Use of \u201cLet us\u2026\u201d multiplies as presidents seek to \u201cuplift the people\u201d when government tools alone are insufficient\u2014again, a clear strategy, not hidden meaning.  \n\n5. Counterargument: Not a \u201cCryptic\u201d Code  \n  a. If inaugurals were cryptic, why would presidents plagiarize memorable lines without attribution? \u201cAsk not\u2026\u201d echoes Harding\u2019s earlier plain exhortations <invalid_quote>\u201cIn his inaugural, Harding\u2026\u2018less concerned about what the government can do\u2026\u2019\u201d</invalid_quote>. The author treats this as literary \u201cmining,\u201d not ciphering.  \n  b. The author repeatedly laments \u201cwhat is said and unsaid\u201d as evidence of moral obtuseness and ignorance, urging humility about our own era. A \u201ccryptic\u201d thesis cannot square with the author\u2019s frank moral judgments.  \n\nConclusion  \n  The author\u2019s recurring emphasis on context, style evolution, topic inclusion/omission, and transparent moral evaluation confirms that inaugurals serve as plain \u201csnapshots\u201d of contemporary beliefs and constraints. The \u201ccryptic interpretation\u201d theory conflicts with the author\u2019s explicit methodology and fails to explain his detailed content analyses.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Reaffirming Cryptic Interpretation  \n   A. Call for \u201cpondering\u201d and future reinterpretation shows inaugurals are clues, not complete reports. The author warns \u201cthere is much more to ponder in these speeches than I have suggested here\u201d and predicts \u201creaders will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today\u201d <quote>There is much more to ponder</quote>; <quote>readers will shake their heads</quote>. Why warn of moral obtuseness if they merely reflect \u201cvalues of those times\u201d? The need for humility arises only when speeches conceal as much as they reveal.  \n   B. Sensitive omissions function as puzzles. The disappearance and re-emergence of \u201crace\u201d and the late debut of \u201cwomen\u201d are not mere context but cryptic silences revealing \u201cmoral obtuseness\u201d demanding decoding: \u201cthe most disturbing aspect \u2026 what is said and unsaid on the subject of race relations\u201d <quote>what is said and unsaid</quote>. A snapshot ignores silence; a cipher highlights it.  \n\n2. Prescriptive Rhetoric Exceeds Description  \n   A. \u201cLet us\u2026\u201d exhortations (16 times by Kennedy; 22 by Nixon) are active attempts to shape public action, not passive reportage: \u201cIf the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people\u201d <quote>If the country is debased and decadent,</quote>. Such prophetic language positions inaugurals as coded instruments to forge national identity.  \n   B. The three \u201cphases\u201d constitute an interpretive taxonomy reading rhetorical shifts as signals: from self-effacement to assertive leadership. Lincoln\u2019s \u201cIt was no time for modesty\u201d <quote>It was no time for modesty</quote> is not a straightforward context note but a cipher unlocking the transition from hidden power to overt federal assertion.  \n\n3. Literary Borrowing as Dialogue Across Time  \n   A. Tracing uncredited reuse of phrases (e.g., Harding to Kennedy) shows inaugurals form a secret discourse: presidents mine \u201cbully pulpit\u201d metaphors and \u201cAsk not\u2026\u201d constructions, building on predecessors\u2019 coded language: \u201cPresidents derived their license to serve as leader-preacher\u201d <quote>Presidents derived their license</quote>. A snapshot would treat borrowing as mere homage; a cryptic view sees an ongoing interpretive dialogue.  \n   B. Changes in sentence length (44\u219234\u219225 words) and style adaptations mark evolving cipher keys for different audiences and media: \u201cthis article has an average of 17 words per sentence\u201d <quote>this article has an average </quote>. The author consciously decodes these changes to unlock meaning for new times.  \n\n4. Debater_B\u2019s \u201cSnapshot\u201d Fails to Explain Interpretive Demands  \n   A. Snapshot view cannot justify the author\u2019s repeated admonitions to question omissions or to apply future moral standards. If inaugurals were transparent, why expect future readers to uncover new insights?  \n   B. Moral judgments on omissions (\u201clynchings must not be tolerated\u201d) are presented without \u201chorror\u201d until decoded by hindsight; the author uses his own interpretive lens to reveal their weakness, demonstrating inaugurals require external decoding to expose their true stance.  \n   C. Snapshot view ignores the author\u2019s emphasis on \u201chumility\u201d and learning from ignorance. Only by treating inaugurals as cryptic texts can one derive humility from their \u201cblind spots.\u201d  \n\n5. Conclusion  \n   The author\u2019s consistent attention to silences, evolving rhetorical codes, prescriptive exhortations, and the genealogy of borrowed phrases highlights inaugurals as cryptic texts requiring interpretation. The \u201csnapshot\u201d thesis collapses under its own consistency: it cannot account for the need to decode omissions, the prophetic language, or the secret dialogue across eras. My thesis fully explains these phenomena; Debater_B\u2019s does not. Therefore, inaugural speeches serve as a cryptic key to interpreting history, not mere passive snapshots.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cSnapshots of Their Time\u201d (Rebuttal to \u201cCryptic\u201d Thesis)\n\n1. Author\u2019s Explicit Methodology Contradicts \u201cCryptic\u201d Interpretation  \n  a. Direct Invitation to Read All Inaugurals as Primary Sources  \n     \u2022 The author urges readers to read \u201call the addresses\u2026to give you a feeling of being there\u2026and limited by\u2026the concerns, and the values of those times\u201d <invalid_quote>They will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian\u2026limited by\u2026the values of those times.</invalid_quote>.  \n     \u2022 This framing treats inaugurals as windows onto their era rather than opaque codes needing decryption. If they were \u201ccryptic,\u201d the author would recommend selective decoding, not comprehensive reading.  \n  b. Transparent Content Analysis of Inclusion and Omission  \n     \u2022 The author systematically catalogs when \u201cwomen,\u201d \u201cslavery,\u201d \u201crace,\u201d and \u201ctaxes\u201d appear or disappear, correlating these patterns with political and social contexts <invalid_quote>\u201c\u2018Taxes\u2019\u2026appears in 43 of the 52 inaugural addresses\u2026\u2018women\u2019 does not appear\u2026until Wilson\u2026\u2018race\u2019\u2026does not appear\u2026until\u20261877.\u201d</invalid_quote>.  \n     \u2022 Such detailed statistical treatment of topics is characteristic of empirical \u201csnapshot\u201d analysis, not cryptographic inference.  \n\n2. Evolution of Style and Media Reflects Practical Adaptation, Not Hidden Codes  \n  a. Sentence-Length Decline Tracks Audience and Technology  \n     \u2022 The author notes the drop from 44 to 25 words per sentence, linking this to \u201cthe change in\u2026the audience and\u2026the means of communication\u201d (radio/TV) <invalid_quote>I do not consider this a deterioration\u2026but\u2026it does reflect the change in\u2026the audience and\u2026the means of communication.</invalid_quote>.  \n     \u2022 Practical considerations explain brevity; cryptic signals would favor complexity, not simplified speech.  \n  b. \u201cLet us\u2026\u201d as Direct Exhortation to Engage Citizens  \n     \u2022 The proliferation of \u201cLet us\u2026\u201d commands is tied to the author\u2019s claim that presidents \u201cbelieved\u2026they could not manage by using government alone\u201d and needed to \u201cuplift the people\u201d <invalid_quote>If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people\u2026Presidents derived their license\u2026from Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s \u2018bully pulpit.\u2019</invalid_quote>.  \n     \u2022 This is an explicit rhetorical strategy to mobilize citizens, not a hidden message to be decoded by future historians.  \n\n3. Prescriptive Elements Do Not Imply \u201cCryptic\u201d Status  \n  a. Active Purpose Serves Contemporary Policy Goals  \n     \u2022 Wilson\u2019s \u201cvision\u2026we approach new affairs\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cAt last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole\u2026With this vision we approach new affairs.\u201d</invalid_quote> shows inaugurals guide immediate policy orientation. A snapshot of beliefs often includes aspirations for the future as part of the era\u2019s mindset.  \n     \u2022 Cryptic texts would obscure rather than proclaim such aims.  \n  b. Reuse of Memorable Lines Demonstrates Plain Citation, Not Secret Code  \n     \u2022 Kennedy\u2019s uncredited echo of Harding\u2019s exhortation <invalid_quote>\u201cAsk not\u2026Ask what you can do\u2026\u201d</invalid_quote> highlights how inaugurals serve as public templates to shape discourse. The author treats this as \u201cmining,\u201d not cryptography.  \n\n4. \u201cMore to Ponder\u201d and Future Perspective Encourage Historical Humility, Not Code-Breaking  \n  a. Acknowledging Future Judgments of Our Era\u2019s Ignorance  \n     \u2022 The author warns that \u201c50 or 100 years from now, readers will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cWe should recognize that\u2026readers will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today.\u201d</invalid_quote>.  \n     \u2022 This is consistent with using inaugurals as transparent records that reveal the moral blind spots of each era; readers need not \u201cdecode\u201d hidden meanings, only observe explicit omissions and statements.  \n  b. \u201cMuch More to Ponder\u201d Invites Broader Historical Research  \n     \u2022 The postscript and references to further analysis encourage contextualized reading, typical of historians examining primary documents. If inaugurals were cryptic, the author would supply the cipher, not ask readers to \u201cponder.\u201d  \n\n5. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cCryptic\u201d Thesis Fails to Explain Author\u2019s Empirical Focus  \n  a. Overstates Interpretive Caution  \n     \u2022 Historical scholarship routinely urges caution and humility; this does not equate to treating texts as encrypted.  \n  b. Misreads Omission as Silence of Social Taboos Rather Than Hidden Signals  \n     \u2022 The author attributes absence of \u201cwomen\u201d and \u201crace\u201d to \u201cmoral obtuseness\u201d and social norms <invalid_quote>\u201ca reader in 1997\u2026amazement at the ignorance\u2026and moral obtuseness\u201d</invalid_quote>. He laments ignorance, not praises cryptic artistry.  \n  c. Ignores Repeated Correlation of Themes with Historical Context  \n     \u2022 The three-phase classification is based on observable stylistic and thematic shifts correlated with events (e.g., Civil War) <invalid_quote>\u201cLincoln\u2026with the South seceding\u2026It was no time for modesty\u201d</invalid_quote>. This causal reading presumes clear intent, not secret symbolism.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe author\u2019s explicit exhortations to read inaugurals as primary sources, his empirical cataloging of topics and style, pragmatic explanations for rhetorical changes, and frank moral judgments all affirm that inaugural speeches serve as plain snapshots of their era\u2019s beliefs, constraints, and values. The \u201ccryptic\u201d interpretation misconstrues scholarly caution and thematic evolution as hidden codes, whereas the text consistently treats inaugurals as transparent windows into past American society.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
