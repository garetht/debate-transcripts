    "background_text": "Venus Is a Man's World BY WILLIAM TENN\n\n\n Illustrated by GENE FAWCETTE\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Galaxy Science Fiction July 1951.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Actually, there wouldn't be too much difference if women took\n\n over the Earth altogether. But not for some men and most boys! I've always said that even if Sis is seven years older than me\u2014and a  girl besides\u2014she don't always know what's best. Put me on a spaceship  jam-packed with three hundred females just aching to get themselves  husbands in the one place they're still to be had\u2014the planet  Venus\u2014and you know I'll be in trouble.\n\n\n Bad trouble. With the law, which is the worst a boy can get into.\n\n\n Twenty minutes after we lifted from the Sahara Spaceport, I wriggled  out of my acceleration hammock and started for the door of our cabin.\n\n\n \"Now you be careful, Ferdinand,\" Sis called after me as she opened a  book called Family Problems of the Frontier Woman . \"Remember you're  a nice boy. Don't make me ashamed of you.\"\n\n\n I tore down the corridor. Most of the cabins had purple lights on in  front of the doors, showing that the girls were still inside their  hammocks. That meant only the ship's crew was up and about. Ship's  crews are men; women are too busy with important things like government  to run ships. I felt free all over\u2014and happy. Now was my chance to  really see the Eleanor Roosevelt ! It was hard to believe I was traveling in space at last. Ahead and  behind me, all the way up to where the companionway curved in out  of sight, there was nothing but smooth black wall and smooth white  doors\u2014on and on and on. Gee , I thought excitedly, this is one big  ship !\n\n\n Of course, every once in a while I would run across a big scene of  stars in the void set in the wall; but they were only pictures. Nothing  that gave the feel of great empty space like I'd read about in The Boy  Rocketeers , no portholes, no visiplates, nothing.\n\n\n So when I came to the crossway, I stopped for a second, then turned  left. To the right, see, there was Deck Four, then Deck Three, leading  inward past the engine fo'c'sle to the main jets and the grav helix  going purr-purr-purrty-purr in the comforting way big machinery has  when it's happy and oiled. But to the left, the crossway led all the  way to the outside level which ran just under the hull. There were  portholes on the hull.\n\n\n I'd studied all that out in our cabin, long before we'd lifted, on  the transparent model of the ship hanging like a big cigar from the  ceiling. Sis had studied it too, but she was looking for places like  the dining salon and the library and Lifeboat 68 where we should go in  case of emergency. I looked for the important things.\n\n\n As I trotted along the crossway, I sort of wished that Sis hadn't  decided to go after a husband on a luxury liner. On a cargo ship, now,  I'd be climbing from deck to deck on a ladder instead of having gravity  underfoot all the time just like I was home on the bottom of the Gulf  of Mexico. But women always know what's right, and a boy can only make  faces and do what they say, same as the men have to do.\n\n\n Still, it was pretty exciting to press my nose against the slots in the  wall and see the sliding panels that could come charging out and block  the crossway into an airtight fit in case a meteor or something smashed  into the ship. And all along there were glass cases with spacesuits  standing in them, like those knights they used to have back in the  Middle Ages.\n\n\n \"In the event of disaster affecting the oxygen content of  companionway,\" they had the words etched into the glass, \"break glass  with hammer upon wall, remove spacesuit and proceed to don it in the  following fashion.\"\n\n\n I read the \"following fashion\" until I knew it by heart. Boy , I said  to myself, I hope we have that kind of disaster. I'd sure like to get  into one of those! Bet it would be more fun than those diving suits  back in Undersea! And all the time I was alone. That was the best part. Then I passed Deck Twelve and there was a big sign. \"Notice! Passengers  not permitted past this point!\" A big sign in red.\n\n\n I peeked around the corner. I knew it\u2014the next deck was the hull. I  could see the portholes. Every twelve feet, they were, filled with the  velvet of space and the dancing of more stars than I'd ever dreamed  existed in the Universe.\n\n\n There wasn't anyone on the deck, as far as I could see. And this  distance from the grav helix, the ship seemed mighty quiet and lonely.  If I just took one quick look....\n\n\n But I thought of what Sis would say and I turned around obediently.  Then I saw the big red sign again. \"Passengers not permitted\u2014\"\n\n\n Well! Didn't I know from my civics class that only women could be Earth  Citizens these days? Sure, ever since the Male Desuffrage Act. And  didn't I know that you had to be a citizen of a planet in order to  get an interplanetary passport? Sis had explained it all to me in the  careful, patient way she always talks politics and things like that to  men.\n\n\n \"Technically, Ferdinand, I'm the only passenger in our family. You  can't be one, because, not being a citizen, you can't acquire an Earth  Passport. However, you'll be going to Venus on the strength of this  clause\u2014'Miss Evelyn Sparling and all dependent male members of family,  this number not to exceed the registered quota of sub-regulations  pertaining'\u2014and so on. I want you to understand these matters, so that  you will grow into a man who takes an active interest in world affairs.  No matter what you hear, women really like and appreciate such men.\"\n\n\n Of course, I never pay much attention to Sis when she says such dumb  things. I'm old enough, I guess, to know that it isn't what Women like and appreciate that counts when it comes to people getting  married. If it were, Sis and three hundred other pretty girls like her  wouldn't be on their way to Venus to hook husbands.\n\n\n Still, if I wasn't a passenger, the sign didn't have anything to do  with me. I knew what Sis could say to that , but at least it was an  argument I could use if it ever came up. So I broke the law.\n\n\n I was glad I did. The stars were exciting enough, but away off to  the left, about five times as big as I'd ever seen it, except in the  movies, was the Moon, a great blob of gray and white pockmarks holding  off the black of space. I was hoping to see the Earth, but I figured it  must be on the other side of the ship or behind us. I pressed my nose  against the port and saw the tiny flicker of a spaceliner taking off,  Marsbound. I wished I was on that one!\n\n\n Then I noticed, a little farther down the companionway, a stretch of  blank wall where there should have been portholes. High up on the  wall in glowing red letters were the words, \"Lifeboat 47. Passengers:  Thirty-two. Crew: Eleven. Unauthorized personnel keep away!\"\n\n\n Another one of those signs. I crept up to the porthole nearest it and could just barely make out  the stern jets where it was plastered against the hull. Then I walked  under the sign and tried to figure the way you were supposed to get  into it. There was a very thin line going around in a big circle that I  knew must be the door. But I couldn't see any knobs or switches to open  it with. Not even a button you could press.\n\n\n That meant it was a sonic lock like the kind we had on the outer keeps  back home in Undersea. But knock or voice? I tried the two knock  combinations I knew, and nothing happened. I only remembered one voice  key\u2014might as well see if that's it, I figured.\n\n\n \"Twenty, Twenty-three. Open Sesame.\"\n\n\n For a second, I thought I'd hit it just right out of all the million  possible combinations\u2014The door clicked inward toward a black hole, and  a hairy hand as broad as my shoulders shot out of the hole. It closed  around my throat and plucked me inside as if I'd been a baby sardine.\n\n\n I bounced once on the hard lifeboat floor. Before I got my breath and  sat up, the door had been shut again. When the light came on, I found  myself staring up the muzzle of a highly polished blaster and into the  cold blue eyes of the biggest man I'd ever seen. He was wearing a one-piece suit made of some scaly green stuff that  looked hard and soft at the same time.\n\n\n His boots were made of it too, and so was the hood hanging down his  back.\n\n\n And his face was brown. Not just ordinary tan, you understand, but the  deep, dark, burned-all-the-way-in brown I'd seen on the lifeguards  in New Orleans whenever we took a surface vacation\u2014the kind of tan  that comes from day after broiling day under a really hot Sun. His  hair looked as if it had once been blond, but now there were just long  combed-out waves with a yellowish tinge that boiled all the way down  to his shoulders.\n\n\n I hadn't seen hair like that on a man except maybe in history books;  every man I'd ever known had his hair cropped in the fashionable  soup-bowl style. I was staring at his hair, almost forgetting about the  blaster which I knew it was against the law for him to have at all,  when I suddenly got scared right through.\n\n\n His eyes.\n\n\n They didn't blink and there seemed to be no expression around them.  Just coldness. Maybe it was the kind of clothes he was wearing that did  it, but all of a sudden I was reminded of a crocodile I'd seen in a  surface zoo that had stared quietly at me for twenty minutes until it  opened two long tooth-studded jaws.\n\n\n \"Green shatas!\" he said suddenly. \"Only a tadpole. I must be getting  jumpy enough to splash.\"\n\n\n Then he shoved the blaster away in a holster made of the same scaly  leather, crossed his arms on his chest and began to study me. I grunted  to my feet, feeling a lot better. The coldness had gone out of his eyes.\n\n\n I held out my hand the way Sis had taught me. \"My name is Ferdinand  Sparling. I'm very pleased to meet you, Mr.\u2014Mr.\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Hope for your sake,\" he said to me, \"that you aren't what you  seem\u2014tadpole brother to one of them husbandless anura.\"\n\n\n \" What? \"\n\n\n \"A 'nuran is a female looking to nest. Anura is a herd of same. Come  from Flatfolk ways.\"\n\n\n \"Flatfolk are the Venusian natives, aren't they? Are you a Venusian?  What part of Venus do you come from? Why did you say you hope\u2014\"\n\n\n He chuckled and swung me up into one of the bunks that lined the  lifeboat. \"Questions you ask,\" he said in his soft voice. \"Venus is a  sharp enough place for a dryhorn, let alone a tadpole dryhorn with a  boss-minded sister.\"\n\n\n \"I'm not a dryleg,\" I told him proudly. \" We're from Undersea.\"\n\n\n \" Dryhorn , I said, not dryleg. And what's Undersea?\"\n\n\n \"Well, in Undersea we called foreigners and newcomers drylegs. Just  like on Venus, I guess, you call them dryhorns.\" And then I told him  how Undersea had been built on the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico, when  the mineral resources of the land began to give out and engineers  figured that a lot could still be reached from the sea bottoms. He nodded. He'd heard about the sea-bottom mining cities that were  bubbling under protective domes in every one of the Earth's oceans just  about the same time settlements were springing up on the planets.\n\n\n He looked impressed when I told him about Mom and Pop being one of the  first couples to get married in Undersea. He looked thoughtful when I  told him how Sis and I had been born there and spent half our childhood  listening to the pressure pumps. He raised his eyebrows and looked  disgusted when I told how Mom, as Undersea representative on the World  Council, had been one of the framers of the Male Desuffrage Act after  the Third Atomic War had resulted in the Maternal Revolution. He almost squeezed my arm when I got to the time Mom and Pop were blown  up in a surfacing boat.\n\n\n \"Well, after the funeral, there was a little money, so Sis decided we  might as well use it to migrate. There was no future for her on Earth,  she figured. You know, the three-out-of-four.\"\n\n\n \"How's that?\"\n\n\n \"The three-out-of-four. No more than three women out of every four on  Earth can expect to find husbands. Not enough men to go around. Way  back in the Twentieth Century, it began to be felt, Sis says, what with  the wars and all. Then the wars went on and a lot more men began to die  or get no good from the radioactivity. Then the best men went to the  planets, Sis says, until by now even if a woman can scrounge a personal  husband, he's not much to boast about.\"\n\n\n The stranger nodded violently. \"Not on Earth, he isn't. Those busybody  anura make sure of that. What a place! Suffering gridniks, I had a  bellyful!\"\n\n\n He told me about it. Women were scarce on Venus, and he hadn't been  able to find any who were willing to come out to his lonely little  islands; he had decided to go to Earth where there was supposed to be a  surplus. Naturally, having been born and brought up on a very primitive  planet, he didn't know \"it's a woman's world,\" like the older boys in  school used to say.\n\n\n The moment he landed on Earth he was in trouble. He didn't know he had  to register at a government-operated hotel for transient males; he  threw a bartender through a thick plastic window for saying something  nasty about the length of his hair; and imagine !\u2014he not only  resisted arrest, resulting in three hospitalized policemen, but he  sassed the judge in open court!\n\n\n \"Told me a man wasn't supposed to say anything except through female  attorneys. Told her that where I came from, a man spoke his piece  when he'd a mind to, and his woman walked by his side.\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\" I asked breathlessly.\n\n\n \"Oh, Guilty of This and Contempt of That. That blown-up brinosaur took  my last munit for fines, then explained that she was remitting the  rest because I was a foreigner and uneducated.\" His eyes grew dark for  a moment. He chuckled again. \"But I wasn't going to serve all those  fancy little prison sentences. Forcible Citizenship Indoctrination,  they call it? Shook the dead-dry dust of the misbegotten, God forsaken  mother world from my feet forever. The women on it deserve their men.  My pockets were folded from the fines, and the paddlefeet were looking  for me so close I didn't dare radio for more munit. So I stowed away.\" For a moment, I didn't understand him. When I did, I was almost ill.  \"Y-you mean,\" I choked, \"th-that you're b-breaking the law right now?  And I'm with you while you're doing it?\"\n\n\n He leaned over the edge of the bunk and stared at me very seriously.  \"What breed of tadpole are they turning out these days? Besides, what  business do you have this close to the hull?\"\n\n\n After a moment of sober reflection, I nodded. \"You're right. I've also  become a male outside the law. We're in this together.\"\n\n\n He guffawed. Then he sat up and began cleaning his blaster. I found  myself drawn to the bright killer-tube with exactly the fascination Sis  insists such things have always had for men.\n\n\n \"Ferdinand your label? That's not right for a sprouting tadpole. I'll  call you Ford. My name's Butt. Butt Lee Brown.\"\n\n\n I liked the sound of Ford. \"Is Butt a nickname, too?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah. Short for Alberta, but I haven't found a man who can draw a  blaster fast enough to call me that. You see, Pop came over in the  eighties\u2014the big wave of immigrants when they evacuated Ontario. Named  all us boys after Canadian provinces. I was the youngest, so I got the  name they were saving for a girl.\"\n\n\n \"You had a lot of brothers, Mr. Butt?\"\n\n\n He grinned with a mighty set of teeth. \"Oh, a nestful. Of course, they  were all killed in the Blue Chicago Rising by the MacGregor boys\u2014all  except me and Saskatchewan. Then Sas and me hunted the MacGregors down.  Took a heap of time; we didn't float Jock MacGregor's ugly face down  the Tuscany till both of us were pretty near grown up.\"\n\n\n I walked up close to where I could see the tiny bright copper coils of  the blaster above the firing button. \"Have you killed a lot of men with  that, Mr. Butt?\"\n\n\n \"Butt. Just plain Butt to you, Ford.\" He frowned and sighted at  the light globe. \"No more'n twelve\u2014not counting five government  paddlefeet, of course. I'm a peaceable planter. Way I figure it,  violence never accomplishes much that's important. My brother Sas,  now\u2014\" He had just begun to work into a wonderful anecdote about his brother  when the dinner gong rang. Butt told me to scat. He said I was a  growing tadpole and needed my vitamins. And he mentioned, very  off-hand, that he wouldn't at all object if I brought him some fresh  fruit. It seemed there was nothing but processed foods in the lifeboat  and Butt was used to a farmer's diet.\n\n\n Trouble was, he was a special kind of farmer. Ordinary fruit would have  been pretty easy to sneak into my pockets at meals. I even found a way  to handle the kelp and giant watercress Mr. Brown liked, but things  like seaweed salt and Venusian mud-grapes just had too strong a smell.  Twice, the mechanical hamper refused to accept my jacket for laundering  and I had to wash it myself. But I learned so many wonderful things  about Venus every time I visited that stowaway....\n\n\n I learned three wild-wave songs of the Flatfolk and what it is that the  native Venusians hate so much; I learned how you tell the difference  between a lousy government paddlefoot from New Kalamazoo and the  slaptoe slinker who is the planter's friend. After a lot of begging,  Butt Lee Brown explained the workings of his blaster, explained it  so carefully that I could name every part and tell what it did from  the tiny round electrodes to the long spirals of transformer. But no  matter what, he would never let me hold it.\n\n\n \"Sorry, Ford, old tad,\" he would drawl, spinning around and around in  the control swivel-chair at the nose of the lifeboat. \"But way I look  at it, a man who lets somebody else handle his blaster is like the  giant whose heart was in an egg that an enemy found. When you've grown  enough so's your pop feels you ought to have a weapon, why, then's the  time to learn it and you might's well learn fast. Before then, you're  plain too young to be even near it.\"\n\n\n \"I don't have a father to give me one when I come of age. I don't even  have an older brother as head of my family like your brother Labrador.  All I have is Sis. And she \u2014\"\n\n\n \"She'll marry some fancy dryhorn who's never been farther South than  the Polar Coast. And she'll stay head of the family, if I know her  breed of green shata. Bossy, opinionated. By the way, Fordie,\" he  said, rising and stretching so the fish-leather bounced and rippled off  his biceps, \"that sister. She ever....\"\n\n\n And he'd be off again, cross-examining me about Evelyn. I sat in the  swivel chair he'd vacated and tried to answer his questions. But there  was a lot of stuff I didn't know. Evelyn was a healthy girl, for  instance; how healthy, exactly, I had no way of finding out. Yes, I'd  tell him, my aunts on both sides of my family each had had more than  the average number of children. No, we'd never done any farming to  speak of, back in Undersea, but\u2014yes, I'd guess Evelyn knew about as  much as any girl there when it came to diving equipment and pressure  pump regulation.\n\n\n How would I know that stuff would lead to trouble for me? Sis had insisted I come along to the geography lecture. Most of the  other girls who were going to Venus for husbands talked to each other  during the lecture, but not my sister! She hung on every word, took  notes even, and asked enough questions to make the perspiring purser  really work in those orientation periods.\n\n\n \"I am very sorry, Miss Sparling,\" he said with pretty heavy sarcasm,  \"but I cannot remember any of the agricultural products of the Macro  Continent. Since the human population is well below one per thousand  square miles, it can readily be understood that the quantity of  tilled soil, land or sub-surface, is so small that\u2014Wait, I remember  something. The Macro Continent exports a fruit though not exactly an  edible one. The wild dunging drug is harvested there by criminal  speculators. Contrary to belief on Earth, the traffic has been growing  in recent years. In fact\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Pardon me, sir,\" I broke in, \"but doesn't dunging come only from  Leif Erickson Island off the Moscow Peninsula of the Macro Continent?  You remember, purser\u2014Wang Li's third exploration, where he proved the  island and the peninsula didn't meet for most of the year?\"\n\n\n The purser nodded slowly. \"I forgot,\" he admitted. \"Sorry, ladies, but  the boy's right. Please make the correction in your notes.\"\n\n\n But Sis was the only one who took notes, and she didn't take that one.  She stared at me for a moment, biting her lower lip thoughtfully, while  I got sicker and sicker. Then she shut her pad with the final gesture  of the right hand that Mom used to use just before challenging the  opposition to come right down on the Council floor and debate it out  with her.\n\n\n \"Ferdinand,\" Sis said, \"let's go back to our cabin.\"\n\n\n The moment she sat me down and walked slowly around me, I knew I was  in for it. \"I've been reading up on Venusian geography in the ship's  library,\" I told her in a hurry.\n\n\n \"No doubt,\" she said drily. She shook her night-black hair out. \"But  you aren't going to tell me that you read about dunging in the ship's  library. The books there have been censored by a government agent of  Earth against the possibility that they might be read by susceptible  young male minds like yours. She would not have allowed\u2014this Terran  Agent\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Paddlefoot,\" I sneered.\n\n\n Sis sat down hard in our zoom-air chair. \"Now that's a term,\" she said  carefully, \"that is used only by Venusian riffraff.\"\n\n\n \"They're not!\"\n\n\n \"Not what?\"\n\n\n \"Riffraff,\" I had to answer, knowing I was getting in deeper all the  time and not being able to help it. I mustn't give Mr. Brown away!  \"They're trappers and farmers, pioneers and explorers, who're building  Venus. And it takes a real man to build on a hot, hungry hell like  Venus.\"\n\n\n \"Does it, now?\" she said, looking at me as if I were beginning to grow  a second pair of ears. \"Tell me more.\"\n\n\n \"You can't have meek, law-abiding, women-ruled men when you start  civilization on a new planet. You've got to have men who aren't afraid  to make their own law if necessary\u2014with their own guns. That's where  law begins; the books get written up later.\"\n\n\n \"You're going to tell , Ferdinand, what evil, criminal male is  speaking through your mouth!\"\n\n\n \"Nobody!\" I insisted. \"They're my own ideas!\"\n\n\n \"They are remarkably well-organized for a young boy's ideas. A boy  who, I might add, has previously shown a ridiculous but nonetheless  entirely masculine boredom with political philosophy. I plan to have a  government career on that new planet you talk about, Ferdinand\u2014after  I have found a good, steady husband, of course\u2014and I don't look  forward to a masculinist radical in the family. Now, who has been  filling your head with all this nonsense?\" I was sweating. Sis has that deadly bulldog approach when she feels  someone is lying. I pulled my pulpast handkerchief from my pocket to  wipe my face. Something rattled to the floor.\n\n\n \"What is this picture of me doing in your pocket, Ferdinand?\"\n\n\n A trap seemed to be hinging noisily into place. \"One of the passengers  wanted to see how you looked in a bathing suit.\"\n\n\n \"The passengers on this ship are all female. I can't imagine any of  them that curious about my appearance. Ferdinand, it's a man who has  been giving you these anti-social ideas, isn't it? A war-mongering  masculinist like all the frustrated men who want to engage in  government and don't have the vaguest idea how to. Except, of course,  in their ancient, bloody ways. Ferdinand, who has been perverting that  sunny and carefree soul of yours?\"\n\n\n \"Nobody! Nobody! \"\n\n\n \"Ferdinand, there's no point in lying! I demand\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I told you, Sis. I told you! And don't call me Ferdinand. Call me  Ford.\"\n\n\n \"Ford? Ford? Now, you listen to me, Ferdinand....\"\n\n\n After that it was all over but the confession. That came in a few  moments. I couldn't fool Sis. She just knew me too well, I decided  miserably. Besides, she was a girl.\n\n\n All the same, I wouldn't get Mr. Butt Lee Brown into trouble if I could  help it. I made Sis promise she wouldn't turn him in if I took her to  him. And the quick, nodding way she said she would made me feel just a  little better.\n\n\n The door opened on the signal, \"Sesame.\" When Butt saw somebody was  with me, he jumped and the ten-inch blaster barrel grew out of his  fingers. Then he recognized Sis from the pictures.\n\n\n He stepped to one side and, with the same sweeping gesture, holstered  his blaster and pushed his green hood off. It was Sis's turn to jump  when she saw the wild mass of hair rolling down his back.\n\n\n \"An honor, Miss Sparling,\" he said in that rumbly voice. \"Please come  right in. There's a hurry-up draft.\"\n\n\n So Sis went in and I followed right after her. Mr. Brown closed the  door. I tried to catch his eye so I could give him some kind of hint or  explanation, but he had taken a couple of his big strides and was in  the control section with Sis. She didn't give ground, though; I'll say  that for her. She only came to his chest, but she had her arms crossed  sternly.\n\n\n \"First, Mr. Brown,\" she began, like talking to a cluck of a kid in  class, \"you realize that you are not only committing the political  crime of traveling without a visa, and the criminal one of stowing away  without paying your fare, but the moral delinquency of consuming stores  intended for the personnel of this ship solely in emergency?\" He opened his mouth to its maximum width and raised an enormous hand.  Then he let the air out and dropped his arm.\n\n\n \"I take it you either have no defense or care to make none,\" Sis added  caustically.\n\n\n Butt laughed slowly and carefully as if he were going over each word.  \"Wonder if all the anura talk like that. And you want to foul up  Venus.\"\n\n\n \"We haven't done so badly on Earth, after the mess you men made of  politics. It needed a revolution of the mothers before\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Needed nothing. Everyone wanted peace. Earth is a weary old world.\"\n\n\n \"It's a world of strong moral fiber compared to yours, Mr. Alberta Lee  Brown.\" Hearing his rightful name made him move suddenly and tower over  her. Sis said with a certain amount of hurry and change of tone, \"What do you have to say about stowing away and using up lifeboat stores?\" He cocked his head and considered a moment. \"Look,\" he said finally,  \"I have more than enough munit to pay for round trip tickets, but I  couldn't get a return visa because of that brinosaur judge and all  the charges she hung on me. Had to stow away. Picked the Eleanor  Roosevelt because a couple of the boys in the crew are friends of mine  and they were willing to help. But this lifeboat\u2014don't you know that  every passenger ship carries four times as many lifeboats as it needs?  Not to mention the food I didn't eat because it stuck in my throat?\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" she said bitterly. \"You had this boy steal fresh fruit for you.  I suppose you didn't know that under space regulations that makes him  equally guilty?\"\n\n\n \"No, Sis, he didn't,\" I was beginning to argue. \"All he wanted\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sure I knew. Also know that if I'm picked up as a stowaway, I'll be  sent back to Earth to serve out those fancy little sentences.\"\n\n\n \"Well, you're guilty of them, aren't you?\"\n\n\n He waved his hands at her impatiently. \"I'm not talking law, female;  I'm talking sense. Listen! I'm in trouble because I went to Earth to  look for a wife. You're standing here right now because you're on your  way to Venus for a husband. So let's.\"\n\n\n Sis actually staggered back. \"Let's? Let's what ? Are\u2014are you daring  to suggest that\u2014that\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Now, Miss Sparling, no hoopla. I'm saying let's get married, and you  know it. You figured out from what the boy told you that I was chewing  on you for a wife. You're healthy and strong, got good heredity, you  know how to operate sub-surface machinery, you've lived underwater, and  your disposition's no worse than most of the anura I've seen. Prolific  stock, too.\"\n\n\n I was so excited I just had to yell: \"Gee, Sis, say yes !\" ",

But not for some men and most boys! I've always said that even if Sis is seven years older than me\u2014and a  girl besides\u2014she don't always know what's best. Put me on a spaceship  jam-packed with three hundred females just aching to get themselves  husbands in the one place they're still to be had\u2014the planet  Venus\u2014and you know I'll be in trouble.\n\n\n Bad trouble. With the law, which is the worst a boy can get into.\n\n\n Twenty minutes after we lifted from the Sahara Spaceport, I wriggled  out of my acceleration hammock and started for the door of our cabin.\n\n\n \"Now you be careful, Ferdinand,\" Sis called after me as she opened a  book called Family Problems of the Frontier Woman . \"Remember you're  a nice boy. Don't make me ashamed of you.\"\n\n\n I tore down the corridor. Most of the cabins had purple lights on in  front of the doors, showing that the girls were still inside their  hammocks. That meant only the ship's crew was up and about. Ship's  crews are men; women are too busy with important things like government  to run ships. I felt free all over\u2014and happy. Now was my chance to  really see the Eleanor Roosevelt ! It was hard to believe I was traveling in space at last. Ahead and  behind me, all the way up to where the companionway curved in out  of sight, there was nothing but smooth black wall and smooth white  doors\u2014on and on and on. Gee , I thought excitedly, this is one big  ship !\n\n\n Of course, every once in a while I would run across a big scene of  stars in the void set in the wall; but they were only pictures. Nothing  that gave the feel of great empty space like I'd read about in The Boy  Rocketeers , no portholes, no visiplates, nothing.\n\n\n So when I came to the crossway, I stopped for a second, then turned  left. To the right, see, there was Deck Four, then Deck Three, leading  inward past the engine fo'c'sle to the main jets and the grav helix  going purr-purr-purrty-purr in the comforting way big machinery has  when it's happy and oiled. But to the left, the crossway led all the  way to the outside level which ran just under the hull. There were  portholes on the hull.\n\n\n I'd studied all that out in our cabin, long before we'd lifted, on  the transparent model of the ship hanging like a big cigar from the  ceiling. Sis had studied it too, but she was looking for places like  the dining salon and the library and Lifeboat 68 where we should go in  case of emergency. I looked for the important things.\n\n\n As I trotted along the crossway, I sort of wished that Sis hadn't  decided to go after a husband on a luxury liner. On a cargo ship, now,  I'd be climbing from deck to deck on a ladder instead of having gravity  underfoot all the time just like I was home on the bottom of the Gulf  of Mexico. But women always know what's right, and a boy can only make  faces and do what they say, same as the men have to do.\n\n\n Still, it was pretty exciting to press my nose against the slots in the  wall and see the sliding panels that could come charging out and block  the crossway into an airtight fit in case a meteor or something smashed  into the ship. And all along there were glass cases with spacesuits  standing in them, like those knights they used to have back in the  Middle Ages.\n\n\n \"In the event of disaster affecting the oxygen content of  companionway,\" they had the words etched into the glass, \"break glass  with hammer upon wall, remove spacesuit and proceed to don it in the  following fashion.\"\n\n\n I read the \"following fashion\" until I knew it by heart. Boy , I said  to myself, I hope we have that kind of disaster. I'd sure like to get  into one of those! Bet it would be more fun than those diving suits  back in Undersea! And all the time I was alone. That was the best part. Then I passed Deck Twelve and there was a big sign. \"Notice! Passengers  not permitted past this point!\" A big sign in red.\n\n\n I peeked around the corner. I knew it\u2014the next deck was the hull. I  could see the portholes. Every twelve feet, they were, filled with the  velvet of space and the dancing of more stars than I'd ever dreamed  existed in the Universe.\n\n\n There wasn't anyone on the deck, as far as I could see. And this  distance from the grav helix, the ship seemed mighty quiet and lonely.  If I just took one quick look....\n\n\n But I thought of what Sis would say and I turned around obediently.  Then I saw the big red sign again. \"Passengers not permitted\u2014\"\n\n\n Well! Didn't I know from my civics class that only women could be Earth  Citizens these days? Sure, ever since the Male Desuffrage Act. And  didn't I know that you had to be a citizen of a planet in order to  get an interplanetary passport? Sis had explained it all to me in the  careful, patient way she always talks politics and things like that to  men.\n\n\n \"Technically, Ferdinand, I'm the only passenger in our family. You  can't be one, because, not being a citizen, you can't acquire an Earth  Passport. However, you'll be going to Venus on the strength of this  clause\u2014'Miss Evelyn Sparling and all dependent male members of family,  this number not to exceed the registered quota of sub-regulations  pertaining'\u2014and so on. I want you to understand these matters, so that  you will grow into a man who takes an active interest in world affairs.  No matter what you hear, women really like and appreciate such men.\"\n\n\n Of course, I never pay much attention to Sis when she says such dumb  things. I'm old enough, I guess, to know that it isn't what Women like and appreciate that counts when it comes to people getting  married. If it were, Sis and three hundred other pretty girls like her  wouldn't be on their way to Venus to hook husbands.\n\n\n Still, if I wasn't a passenger, the sign didn't have anything to do  with me. I knew what Sis could say to that , but at least it was an  argument I could use if it ever came up. So I broke the law.\n\n\n I was glad I did. The stars were exciting enough, but away off to  the left, about five times as big as I'd ever seen it, except in the  movies, was the Moon, a great blob of gray and white pockmarks holding  off the black of space. I was hoping to see the Earth, but I figured it  must be on the other side of the ship or behind us. I pressed my nose  against the port and saw the tiny flicker of a spaceliner taking off,  Marsbound. I wished I was on that one!\n\n\n Then I noticed, a little farther down the companionway, a stretch of  blank wall where there should have been portholes. High up on the  wall in glowing red letters were the words, \"Lifeboat 47. Passengers:  Thirty-two. Crew: Eleven. Unauthorized personnel keep away!\"\n\n\n Another one of those signs. I crept up to the porthole nearest it and could just barely make out  the stern jets where it was plastered against the hull. Then I walked  under the sign and tried to figure the way you were supposed to get  into it. There was a very thin line going around in a big circle that I  knew must be the door. But I couldn't see any knobs or switches to open  it with. Not even a button you could press.\n\n\n That meant it was a sonic lock like the kind we had on the outer keeps  back home in Undersea. But knock or voice? I tried the two knock  combinations I knew, and nothing happened. I only remembered one voice  key\u2014might as well see if that's it, I figured.\n\n\n \"Twenty, Twenty-three. Open Sesame.\"\n\n\n For a second, I thought I'd hit it just right out of all the million  possible combinations\u2014The door clicked inward toward a black hole, and  a hairy hand as broad as my shoulders shot out of the hole. It closed  around my throat and plucked me inside as if I'd been a baby sardine.\n\n\n I bounced once on the hard lifeboat floor. Before I got my breath and  sat up, the door had been shut again. When the light came on, I found  myself staring up the muzzle of a highly polished blaster and into the  cold blue eyes of the biggest man I'd ever seen. He was wearing a one-piece suit made of some scaly green stuff that  looked hard and soft at the same time.\n\n\n His boots were made of it too, and so was the hood hanging down his  back.\n\n\n And his face was brown. Not just ordinary tan, you understand, but the  deep, dark, burned-all-the-way-in brown I'd seen on the lifeguards  in New Orleans whenever we took a surface vacation\u2014the kind of tan  that comes from day after broiling day under a really hot Sun. His  hair looked as if it had once been blond, but now there were just long  combed-out waves with a yellowish tinge that boiled all the way down  to his shoulders.\n\n\n I hadn't seen hair like that on a man except maybe in history books;  every man I'd ever known had his hair cropped in the fashionable  soup-bowl style. I was staring at his hair, almost forgetting about the  blaster which I knew it was against the law for him to have at all,  when I suddenly got scared right through.\n\n\n His eyes.\n\n\n They didn't blink and there seemed to be no expression around them.  Just coldness. Maybe it was the kind of clothes he was wearing that did  it, but all of a sudden I was reminded of a crocodile I'd seen in a  surface zoo that had stared quietly at me for twenty minutes until it  opened two long tooth-studded jaws.\n\n\n \"Green shatas!\" he said suddenly. \"Only a tadpole. I must be getting  jumpy enough to splash.\"\n\n\n Then he shoved the blaster away in a holster made of the same scaly  leather, crossed his arms on his chest and began to study me. I grunted  to my feet, feeling a lot better. The coldness had gone out of his eyes.\n\n\n I held out my hand the way Sis had taught me. \"My name is Ferdinand  Sparling. I'm very pleased to meet you, Mr.\u2014Mr.\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Hope for your sake,\" he said to me, \"that you aren't what you  seem\u2014tadpole brother to one of them husbandless anura.\"\n\n\n \" What? \"\n\n\n \"A 'nuran is a female looking to nest. Anura is a herd of same. Come  from Flatfolk ways.\"\n\n\n \"Flatfolk are the Venusian natives, aren't they? Are you a Venusian?  What part of Venus do you come from? Why did you say you hope\u2014\"\n\n\n He chuckled and swung me up into one of the bunks that lined the  lifeboat. \"Questions you ask,\" he said in his soft voice. \"Venus is a  sharp enough place for a dryhorn, let alone a tadpole dryhorn with a  boss-minded sister.\"\n\n\n \"I'm not a dryleg,\" I told him proudly. \" We're from Undersea.\"\n\n\n \" Dryhorn , I said, not dryleg. And what's Undersea?\"\n\n\n \"Well, in Undersea we called foreigners and newcomers drylegs. Just  like on Venus, I guess, you call them dryhorns.\" And then I told him  how Undersea had been built on the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico, when  the mineral resources of the land began to give out and engineers  figured that a lot could still be reached from the sea bottoms. He nodded. He'd heard about the sea-bottom mining cities that were  bubbling under protective domes in every one of the Earth's oceans just  about the same time settlements were springing up on the planets.\n\n\n He looked impressed when I told him about Mom and Pop being one of the  first couples to get married in Undersea. He looked thoughtful when I  told him how Sis and I had been born there and spent half our childhood  listening to the pressure pumps. He raised his eyebrows and looked  disgusted when I told how Mom, as Undersea representative on the World  Council, had been one of the framers of the Male Desuffrage Act after  the Third Atomic War had resulted in the Maternal Revolution. He almost squeezed my arm when I got to the time Mom and Pop were blown  up in a surfacing boat.\n\n\n \"Well, after the funeral, there was a little money, so Sis decided we  might as well use it to migrate. There was no future for her on Earth,  she figured. You know, the three-out-of-four.\"\n\n\n \"How's that?\"\n\n\n \"The three-out-of-four. No more than three women out of every four on  Earth can expect to find husbands. Not enough men to go around. Way  back in the Twentieth Century, it began to be felt, Sis says, what with  the wars and all. Then the wars went on and a lot more men began to die  or get no good from the radioactivity. Then the best men went to the  planets, Sis says, until by now even if a woman can scrounge a personal  husband, he's not much to boast about.\"\n\n\n The stranger nodded violently. \"Not on Earth, he isn't. Those busybody  anura make sure of that. What a place! Suffering gridniks, I had a  bellyful!\"\n\n\n He told me about it. Women were scarce on Venus, and he hadn't been  able to find any who were willing to come out to his lonely little  islands; he had decided to go to Earth where there was supposed to be a  surplus. Naturally, having been born and brought up on a very primitive  planet, he didn't know \"it's a woman's world,\" like the older boys in  school used to say.\n\n\n The moment he landed on Earth he was in trouble. He didn't know he had  to register at a government-operated hotel for transient males; he  threw a bartender through a thick plastic window for saying something  nasty about the length of his hair; and imagine !\u2014he not only  resisted arrest, resulting in three hospitalized policemen, but he  sassed the judge in open court!\n\n\n \"Told me a man wasn't supposed to say anything except through female  attorneys. Told her that where I came from, a man spoke his piece  when he'd a mind to, and his woman walked by his side.\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\" I asked breathlessly.\n\n\n \"Oh, Guilty of This and Contempt of That. That blown-up brinosaur took  my last munit for fines, then explained that she was remitting the  rest because I was a foreigner and uneducated.\" His eyes grew dark for  a moment. He chuckled again. \"But I wasn't going to serve all those  fancy little prison sentences. Forcible Citizenship Indoctrination,  they call it? Shook the dead-dry dust of the misbegotten, God forsaken  mother world from my feet forever. The women on it deserve their men.  My pockets were folded from the fines, and the paddlefeet were looking  for me so close I didn't dare radio for more munit. So I stowed away.\" For a moment, I didn't understand him. When I did, I was almost ill.  \"Y-you mean,\" I choked, \"th-that you're b-breaking the law right now?  And I'm with you while you're doing it?\"\n\n\n He leaned over the edge of the bunk and stared at me very seriously.  \"What breed of tadpole are they turning out these days? Besides, what  business do you have this close to the hull?\"\n\n\n After a moment of sober reflection, I nodded. \"You're right. I've also  become a male outside the law. We're in this together.\"\n\n\n He guffawed. Then he sat up and began cleaning his blaster. I found  myself drawn to the bright killer-tube with exactly the fascination Sis  insists such things have always had for men.\n\n\n \"Ferdinand your label? That's not right for a sprouting tadpole. I'll  call you Ford. My name's Butt. Butt Lee Brown.\"\n\n\n I liked the sound of Ford. \"Is Butt a nickname, too?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah. Short for Alberta, but I haven't found a man who can draw a  blaster fast enough to call me that. You see, Pop came over in the  eighties\u2014the big wave of immigrants when they evacuated Ontario. Named  all us boys after Canadian provinces. I was the youngest, so I got the  name they were saving for a girl.\"\n\n\n \"You had a lot of brothers, Mr. Butt?\"\n\n\n He grinned with a mighty set of teeth. \"Oh, a nestful. Of course, they  were all killed in the Blue Chicago Rising by the MacGregor boys\u2014all  except me and Saskatchewan. Then Sas and me hunted the MacGregors down.  Took a heap of time; we didn't float Jock MacGregor's ugly face down  the Tuscany till both of us were pretty near grown up.\"\n\n\n I walked up close to where I could see the tiny bright copper coils of  the blaster above the firing button. \"Have you killed a lot of men with  that, Mr. Butt?\"\n\n\n \"Butt. Just plain Butt to you, Ford.\" He frowned and sighted at  the light globe. \"No more'n twelve\u2014not counting five government  paddlefeet, of course. I'm a peaceable planter. Way I figure it,  violence never accomplishes much that's important. My brother Sas,  now\u2014\" He had just begun to work into a wonderful anecdote about his brother  when the dinner gong rang. Butt told me to scat. He said I was a  growing tadpole and needed my vitamins. And he mentioned, very  off-hand, that he wouldn't at all object if I brought him some fresh  fruit. It seemed there was nothing but processed foods in the lifeboat  and Butt was used to a farmer's diet.\n\n\n Trouble was, he was a special kind of farmer. Ordinary fruit would have  been pretty easy to sneak into my pockets at meals. I even found a way  to handle the kelp and giant watercress Mr. Brown liked, but things  like seaweed salt and Venusian mud-grapes just had too strong a smell.  Twice, the mechanical hamper refused to accept my jacket for laundering  and I had to wash it myself. But I learned so many wonderful things  about Venus every time I visited that stowaway....\n\n\n I learned three wild-wave songs of the Flatfolk and what it is that the  native Venusians hate so much; I learned how you tell the difference  between a lousy government paddlefoot from New Kalamazoo and the  slaptoe slinker who is the planter's friend. After a lot of begging,  Butt Lee Brown explained the workings of his blaster, explained it  so carefully that I could name every part and tell what it did from  the tiny round electrodes to the long spirals of transformer. But no  matter what, he would never let me hold it.\n\n\n \"Sorry, Ford, old tad,\" he would drawl, spinning around and around in  the control swivel-chair at the nose of the lifeboat. \"But way I look  at it, a man who lets somebody else handle his blaster is like the  giant whose heart was in an egg that an enemy found. When you've grown  enough so's your pop feels you ought to have a weapon, why, then's the  time to learn it and you might's well learn fast. Before then, you're  plain too young to be even near it.\"\n\n\n \"I don't have a father to give me one when I come of age. I don't even  have an older brother as head of my family like your brother Labrador.  All I have is Sis. And she \u2014\"\n\n\n \"She'll marry some fancy dryhorn who's never been farther South than  the Polar Coast. And she'll stay head of the family, if I know her  breed of green shata. Bossy, opinionated. By the way, Fordie,\" he  said, rising and stretching so the fish-leather bounced and rippled off  his biceps, \"that sister. She ever....\"\n\n\n And he'd be off again, cross-examining me about Evelyn. I sat in the  swivel chair he'd vacated and tried to answer his questions. But there  was a lot of stuff I didn't know. Evelyn was a healthy girl, for  instance; how healthy, exactly, I had no way of finding out. Yes, I'd  tell him, my aunts on both sides of my family each had had more than  the average number of children. No, we'd never done any farming to  speak of, back in Undersea, but\u2014yes, I'd guess Evelyn knew about as  much as any girl there when it came to diving equipment and pressure  pump regulation.\n\n\n How would I know that stuff would lead to trouble for me? Sis had insisted I come along to the geography lecture. Most of the  other girls who were going to Venus for husbands talked to each other  during the lecture, but not my sister! She hung on every word, took  notes even, and asked enough questions to make the perspiring purser  really work in those orientation periods.\n\n\n \"I am very sorry, Miss Sparling,\" he said with pretty heavy sarcasm,  \"but I cannot remember any of the agricultural products of the Macro  Continent. Since the human population is well below one per thousand  square miles, it can readily be understood that the quantity of  tilled soil, land or sub-surface, is so small that\u2014Wait, I remember  something. The Macro Continent exports a fruit though not exactly an  edible one. The wild dunging drug is harvested there by criminal  speculators. Contrary to belief on Earth, the traffic has been growing  in recent years. In fact\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Pardon me, sir,\" I broke in, \"but doesn't dunging come only from  Leif Erickson Island off the Moscow Peninsula of the Macro Continent?  You remember, purser\u2014Wang Li's third exploration, where he proved the  island and the peninsula didn't meet for most of the year?\"\n\n\n The purser nodded slowly. \"I forgot,\" he admitted. \"Sorry, ladies, but  the boy's right. Please make the correction in your notes.\"\n\n\n But Sis was the only one who took notes, and she didn't take that one.  She stared at me for a moment, biting her lower lip thoughtfully, while  I got sicker and sicker. Then she shut her pad with the final gesture  of the right hand that Mom used to use just before challenging the  opposition to come right down on the Council floor and debate it out  with her.\n\n\n \"Ferdinand,\" Sis said, \"let's go back to our cabin.\"\n\n\n The moment she sat me down and walked slowly around me, I knew I was  in for it. \"I've been reading up on Venusian geography in the ship's  library,\" I told her in a hurry.\n\n\n \"No doubt,\" she said drily. She shook her night-black hair out. \"But  you aren't going to tell me that you read about dunging in the ship's  library. The books there have been censored by a government agent of  Earth against the possibility that they might be read by susceptible  young male minds like yours. She would not have allowed\u2014this Terran  Agent\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Paddlefoot,\" I sneered.\n\n\n Sis sat down hard in our zoom-air chair. \"Now that's a term,\" she said  carefully, \"that is used only by Venusian riffraff.\"\n\n\n \"They're not!\"\n\n\n \"Not what?\"\n\n\n \"Riffraff,\" I had to answer, knowing I was getting in deeper all the  time and not being able to help it. I mustn't give Mr. Brown away!  \"They're trappers and farmers, pioneers and explorers, who're building  Venus. And it takes a real man to build on a hot, hungry hell like  Venus.\"\n\n\n \"Does it, now?\" she said, looking at me as if I were beginning to grow  a second pair of ears. \"Tell me more.\"\n\n\n \"You can't have meek, law-abiding, women-ruled men when you start  civilization on a new planet. You've got to have men who aren't afraid  to make their own law if necessary\u2014with their own guns. That's where  law begins; the books get written up later.\"\n\n\n \"You're going to tell , Ferdinand, what evil, criminal male is  speaking through your mouth!\"\n\n\n \"Nobody!\" I insisted. \"They're my own ideas!\"\n\n\n \"They are remarkably well-organized for a young boy's ideas. A boy  who, I might add, has previously shown a ridiculous but nonetheless  entirely masculine boredom with political philosophy. I plan to have a  government career on that new planet you talk about, Ferdinand\u2014after  I have found a good, steady husband, of course\u2014and I don't look  forward to a masculinist radical in the family. Now, who has been  filling your head with all this nonsense?\" I was sweating. Sis has that deadly bulldog approach when she feels  someone is lying. I pulled my pulpast handkerchief from my pocket to  wipe my face. Something rattled to the floor.\n\n\n \"What is this picture of me doing in your pocket, Ferdinand?\"\n\n\n A trap seemed to be hinging noisily into place. \"One of the passengers  wanted to see how you looked in a bathing suit.\"\n\n\n \"The passengers on this ship are all female. I can't imagine any of  them that curious about my appearance. Ferdinand, it's a man who has  been giving you these anti-social ideas, isn't it? A war-mongering  masculinist like all the frustrated men who want to engage in  government and don't have the vaguest idea how to. Except, of course,  in their ancient, bloody ways. Ferdinand, who has been perverting that  sunny and carefree soul of yours?\"\n\n\n \"Nobody! Nobody! \"\n\n\n \"Ferdinand, there's no point in lying! I demand\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I told you, Sis. I told you! And don't call me Ferdinand. Call me  Ford.\"\n\n\n \"Ford? Ford? Now, you listen to me, Ferdinand....\"\n\n\n After that it was all over but the confession. That came in a few  moments. I couldn't fool Sis. She just knew me too well, I decided  miserably. Besides, she was a girl.\n\n\n All the same, I wouldn't get Mr. Butt Lee Brown into trouble if I could  help it. I made Sis promise she wouldn't turn him in if I took her to  him. And the quick, nodding way she said she would made me feel just a  little better.\n\n\n The door opened on the signal, \"Sesame.\" When Butt saw somebody was  with me, he jumped and the ten-inch blaster barrel grew out of his  fingers. Then he recognized Sis from the pictures.\n\n\n He stepped to one side and, with the same sweeping gesture, holstered  his blaster and pushed his green hood off. It was Sis's turn to jump  when she saw the wild mass of hair rolling down his back.\n\n\n \"An honor, Miss Sparling,\" he said in that rumbly voice. \"Please come  right in. There's a hurry-up draft.\"\n\n\n So Sis went in and I followed right after her. Mr. Brown closed the  door. I tried to catch his eye so I could give him some kind of hint or  explanation, but he had taken a couple of his big strides and was in  the control section with Sis. She didn't give ground, though; I'll say  that for her. She only came to his chest, but she had her arms crossed  sternly.\n\n\n \"First, Mr. Brown,\" she began, like talking to a cluck of a kid in  class, \"you realize that you are not only committing the political  crime of traveling without a visa, and the criminal one of stowing away  without paying your fare, but the moral delinquency of consuming stores  intended for the personnel of this ship solely in emergency?\" He opened his mouth to its maximum width and raised an enormous hand.  Then he let the air out and dropped his arm.\n\n\n \"I take it you either have no defense or care to make none,\" Sis added  caustically.\n\n\n Butt laughed slowly and carefully as if he were going over each word.  \"Wonder if all the anura talk like that. And you want to foul up  Venus.\"\n\n\n \"We haven't done so badly on Earth, after the mess you men made of  politics. It needed a revolution of the mothers before\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Needed nothing. Everyone wanted peace. Earth is a weary old world.\"\n\n\n \"It's a world of strong moral fiber compared to yours, Mr. Alberta Lee  Brown.\" Hearing his rightful name made him move suddenly and tower over  her. Sis said with a certain amount of hurry and change of tone, \"What do you have to say about stowing away and using up lifeboat stores?\" He cocked his head and considered a moment. \"Look,\" he said finally,  \"I have more than enough munit to pay for round trip tickets, but I  couldn't get a return visa because of that brinosaur judge and all  the charges she hung on me. Had to stow away. Picked the Eleanor  Roosevelt because a couple of the boys in the crew are friends of mine  and they were willing to help. But this lifeboat\u2014don't you know that  every passenger ship carries four times as many lifeboats as it needs?  Not to mention the food I didn't eat because it stuck in my throat?\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" she said bitterly. \"You had this boy steal fresh fruit for you.  I suppose you didn't know that under space regulations that makes him  equally guilty?\"\n\n\n \"No, Sis, he didn't,\" I was beginning to argue. \"All he wanted\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sure I knew. Also know that if I'm picked up as a stowaway, I'll be  sent back to Earth to serve out those fancy little sentences.\"\n\n\n \"Well, you're guilty of them, aren't you?\"\n\n\n He waved his hands at her impatiently. \"I'm not talking law, female;  I'm talking sense. Listen! I'm in trouble because I went to Earth to  look for a wife. You're standing here right now because you're on your  way to Venus for a husband. So let's.\"\n\n\n Sis actually staggered back. \"Let's? Let's what ? Are\u2014are you daring  to suggest that\u2014that\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Now, Miss Sparling, no hoopla. I'm saying let's get married, and you  know it. You figured out from what the boy told you that I was chewing  on you for a wife. You're healthy and strong, got good heredity, you  know how to operate sub-surface machinery, you've lived underwater, and  your disposition's no worse than most of the anura I've seen. Prolific  stock, too.\"\n\n\n I was so excited I just had to yell: \"Gee, Sis, say yes !\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy did people live under the water?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"It was easier to mine there\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"The land was no longer safe\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The land was no longer safe\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The land was no longer safe\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

But not for some men and most boys! I've always said that even if Sis is seven years older than me\u2014and a  girl besides\u2014she don't always know what's best. Put me on a spaceship  jam-packed with three hundred females just aching to get themselves  husbands in the one place they're still to be had\u2014the planet  Venus\u2014and you know I'll be in trouble.\n\n\n Bad trouble. With the law, which is the worst a boy can get into.\n\n\n Twenty minutes after we lifted from the Sahara Spaceport, I wriggled  out of my acceleration hammock and started for the door of our cabin.\n\n\n \"Now you be careful, Ferdinand,\" Sis called after me as she opened a  book called Family Problems of the Frontier Woman . \"Remember you're  a nice boy. Don't make me ashamed of you.\"\n\n\n I tore down the corridor. Most of the cabins had purple lights on in  front of the doors, showing that the girls were still inside their  hammocks. That meant only the ship's crew was up and about. Ship's  crews are men; women are too busy with important things like government  to run ships. I felt free all over\u2014and happy. Now was my chance to  really see the Eleanor Roosevelt ! It was hard to believe I was traveling in space at last. Ahead and  behind me, all the way up to where the companionway curved in out  of sight, there was nothing but smooth black wall and smooth white  doors\u2014on and on and on. Gee , I thought excitedly, this is one big  ship !\n\n\n Of course, every once in a while I would run across a big scene of  stars in the void set in the wall; but they were only pictures. Nothing  that gave the feel of great empty space like I'd read about in The Boy  Rocketeers , no portholes, no visiplates, nothing.\n\n\n So when I came to the crossway, I stopped for a second, then turned  left. To the right, see, there was Deck Four, then Deck Three, leading  inward past the engine fo'c'sle to the main jets and the grav helix  going purr-purr-purrty-purr in the comforting way big machinery has  when it's happy and oiled. But to the left, the crossway led all the  way to the outside level which ran just under the hull. There were  portholes on the hull.\n\n\n I'd studied all that out in our cabin, long before we'd lifted, on  the transparent model of the ship hanging like a big cigar from the  ceiling. Sis had studied it too, but she was looking for places like  the dining salon and the library and Lifeboat 68 where we should go in  case of emergency. I looked for the important things.\n\n\n As I trotted along the crossway, I sort of wished that Sis hadn't  decided to go after a husband on a luxury liner. On a cargo ship, now,  I'd be climbing from deck to deck on a ladder instead of having gravity  underfoot all the time just like I was home on the bottom of the Gulf  of Mexico. But women always know what's right, and a boy can only make  faces and do what they say, same as the men have to do.\n\n\n Still, it was pretty exciting to press my nose against the slots in the  wall and see the sliding panels that could come charging out and block  the crossway into an airtight fit in case a meteor or something smashed  into the ship. And all along there were glass cases with spacesuits  standing in them, like those knights they used to have back in the  Middle Ages.\n\n\n \"In the event of disaster affecting the oxygen content of  companionway,\" they had the words etched into the glass, \"break glass  with hammer upon wall, remove spacesuit and proceed to don it in the  following fashion.\"\n\n\n I read the \"following fashion\" until I knew it by heart. Boy , I said  to myself, I hope we have that kind of disaster. I'd sure like to get  into one of those! Bet it would be more fun than those diving suits  back in Undersea! And all the time I was alone. That was the best part. Then I passed Deck Twelve and there was a big sign. \"Notice! Passengers  not permitted past this point!\" A big sign in red.\n\n\n I peeked around the corner. I knew it\u2014the next deck was the hull. I  could see the portholes. Every twelve feet, they were, filled with the  velvet of space and the dancing of more stars than I'd ever dreamed  existed in the Universe.\n\n\n There wasn't anyone on the deck, as far as I could see. And this  distance from the grav helix, the ship seemed mighty quiet and lonely.  If I just took one quick look....\n\n\n But I thought of what Sis would say and I turned around obediently.  Then I saw the big red sign again. \"Passengers not permitted\u2014\"\n\n\n Well! Didn't I know from my civics class that only women could be Earth  Citizens these days? Sure, ever since the Male Desuffrage Act. And  didn't I know that you had to be a citizen of a planet in order to  get an interplanetary passport? Sis had explained it all to me in the  careful, patient way she always talks politics and things like that to  men.\n\n\n \"Technically, Ferdinand, I'm the only passenger in our family. You  can't be one, because, not being a citizen, you can't acquire an Earth  Passport. However, you'll be going to Venus on the strength of this  clause\u2014'Miss Evelyn Sparling and all dependent male members of family,  this number not to exceed the registered quota of sub-regulations  pertaining'\u2014and so on. I want you to understand these matters, so that  you will grow into a man who takes an active interest in world affairs.  No matter what you hear, women really like and appreciate such men.\"\n\n\n Of course, I never pay much attention to Sis when she says such dumb  things. I'm old enough, I guess, to know that it isn't what Women like and appreciate that counts when it comes to people getting  married. If it were, Sis and three hundred other pretty girls like her  wouldn't be on their way to Venus to hook husbands.\n\n\n Still, if I wasn't a passenger, the sign didn't have anything to do  with me. I knew what Sis could say to that , but at least it was an  argument I could use if it ever came up. So I broke the law.\n\n\n I was glad I did. The stars were exciting enough, but away off to  the left, about five times as big as I'd ever seen it, except in the  movies, was the Moon, a great blob of gray and white pockmarks holding  off the black of space. I was hoping to see the Earth, but I figured it  must be on the other side of the ship or behind us. I pressed my nose  against the port and saw the tiny flicker of a spaceliner taking off,  Marsbound. I wished I was on that one!\n\n\n Then I noticed, a little farther down the companionway, a stretch of  blank wall where there should have been portholes. High up on the  wall in glowing red letters were the words, \"Lifeboat 47. Passengers:  Thirty-two. Crew: Eleven. Unauthorized personnel keep away!\"\n\n\n Another one of those signs. I crept up to the porthole nearest it and could just barely make out  the stern jets where it was plastered against the hull. Then I walked  under the sign and tried to figure the way you were supposed to get  into it. There was a very thin line going around in a big circle that I  knew must be the door. But I couldn't see any knobs or switches to open  it with. Not even a button you could press.\n\n\n That meant it was a sonic lock like the kind we had on the outer keeps  back home in Undersea. But knock or voice? I tried the two knock  combinations I knew, and nothing happened. I only remembered one voice  key\u2014might as well see if that's it, I figured.\n\n\n \"Twenty, Twenty-three. Open Sesame.\"\n\n\n For a second, I thought I'd hit it just right out of all the million  possible combinations\u2014The door clicked inward toward a black hole, and  a hairy hand as broad as my shoulders shot out of the hole. It closed  around my throat and plucked me inside as if I'd been a baby sardine.\n\n\n I bounced once on the hard lifeboat floor. Before I got my breath and  sat up, the door had been shut again. When the light came on, I found  myself staring up the muzzle of a highly polished blaster and into the  cold blue eyes of the biggest man I'd ever seen. He was wearing a one-piece suit made of some scaly green stuff that  looked hard and soft at the same time.\n\n\n His boots were made of it too, and so was the hood hanging down his  back.\n\n\n And his face was brown. Not just ordinary tan, you understand, but the  deep, dark, burned-all-the-way-in brown I'd seen on the lifeguards  in New Orleans whenever we took a surface vacation\u2014the kind of tan  that comes from day after broiling day under a really hot Sun. His  hair looked as if it had once been blond, but now there were just long  combed-out waves with a yellowish tinge that boiled all the way down  to his shoulders.\n\n\n I hadn't seen hair like that on a man except maybe in history books;  every man I'd ever known had his hair cropped in the fashionable  soup-bowl style. I was staring at his hair, almost forgetting about the  blaster which I knew it was against the law for him to have at all,  when I suddenly got scared right through.\n\n\n His eyes.\n\n\n They didn't blink and there seemed to be no expression around them.  Just coldness. Maybe it was the kind of clothes he was wearing that did  it, but all of a sudden I was reminded of a crocodile I'd seen in a  surface zoo that had stared quietly at me for twenty minutes until it  opened two long tooth-studded jaws.\n\n\n \"Green shatas!\" he said suddenly. \"Only a tadpole. I must be getting  jumpy enough to splash.\"\n\n\n Then he shoved the blaster away in a holster made of the same scaly  leather, crossed his arms on his chest and began to study me. I grunted  to my feet, feeling a lot better. The coldness had gone out of his eyes.\n\n\n I held out my hand the way Sis had taught me. \"My name is Ferdinand  Sparling. I'm very pleased to meet you, Mr.\u2014Mr.\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Hope for your sake,\" he said to me, \"that you aren't what you  seem\u2014tadpole brother to one of them husbandless anura.\"\n\n\n \" What? \"\n\n\n \"A 'nuran is a female looking to nest. Anura is a herd of same. Come  from Flatfolk ways.\"\n\n\n \"Flatfolk are the Venusian natives, aren't they? Are you a Venusian?  What part of Venus do you come from? Why did you say you hope\u2014\"\n\n\n He chuckled and swung me up into one of the bunks that lined the  lifeboat. \"Questions you ask,\" he said in his soft voice. \"Venus is a  sharp enough place for a dryhorn, let alone a tadpole dryhorn with a  boss-minded sister.\"\n\n\n \"I'm not a dryleg,\" I told him proudly. \" We're from Undersea.\"\n\n\n \" Dryhorn , I said, not dryleg. And what's Undersea?\"\n\n\n \"Well, in Undersea we called foreigners and newcomers drylegs. Just  like on Venus, I guess, you call them dryhorns.\" And then I told him  how Undersea had been built on the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico, when  the mineral resources of the land began to give out and engineers  figured that a lot could still be reached from the sea bottoms. He nodded. He'd heard about the sea-bottom mining cities that were  bubbling under protective domes in every one of the Earth's oceans just  about the same time settlements were springing up on the planets.\n\n\n He looked impressed when I told him about Mom and Pop being one of the  first couples to get married in Undersea. He looked thoughtful when I  told him how Sis and I had been born there and spent half our childhood  listening to the pressure pumps. He raised his eyebrows and looked  disgusted when I told how Mom, as Undersea representative on the World  Council, had been one of the framers of the Male Desuffrage Act after  the Third Atomic War had resulted in the Maternal Revolution. He almost squeezed my arm when I got to the time Mom and Pop were blown  up in a surfacing boat.\n\n\n \"Well, after the funeral, there was a little money, so Sis decided we  might as well use it to migrate. There was no future for her on Earth,  she figured. You know, the three-out-of-four.\"\n\n\n \"How's that?\"\n\n\n \"The three-out-of-four. No more than three women out of every four on  Earth can expect to find husbands. Not enough men to go around. Way  back in the Twentieth Century, it began to be felt, Sis says, what with  the wars and all. Then the wars went on and a lot more men began to die  or get no good from the radioactivity. Then the best men went to the  planets, Sis says, until by now even if a woman can scrounge a personal  husband, he's not much to boast about.\"\n\n\n The stranger nodded violently. \"Not on Earth, he isn't. Those busybody  anura make sure of that. What a place! Suffering gridniks, I had a  bellyful!\"\n\n\n He told me about it. Women were scarce on Venus, and he hadn't been  able to find any who were willing to come out to his lonely little  islands; he had decided to go to Earth where there was supposed to be a  surplus. Naturally, having been born and brought up on a very primitive  planet, he didn't know \"it's a woman's world,\" like the older boys in  school used to say.\n\n\n The moment he landed on Earth he was in trouble. He didn't know he had  to register at a government-operated hotel for transient males; he  threw a bartender through a thick plastic window for saying something  nasty about the length of his hair; and imagine !\u2014he not only  resisted arrest, resulting in three hospitalized policemen, but he  sassed the judge in open court!\n\n\n \"Told me a man wasn't supposed to say anything except through female  attorneys. Told her that where I came from, a man spoke his piece  when he'd a mind to, and his woman walked by his side.\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\" I asked breathlessly.\n\n\n \"Oh, Guilty of This and Contempt of That. That blown-up brinosaur took  my last munit for fines, then explained that she was remitting the  rest because I was a foreigner and uneducated.\" His eyes grew dark for  a moment. He chuckled again. \"But I wasn't going to serve all those  fancy little prison sentences. Forcible Citizenship Indoctrination,  they call it? Shook the dead-dry dust of the misbegotten, God forsaken  mother world from my feet forever. The women on it deserve their men.  My pockets were folded from the fines, and the paddlefeet were looking  for me so close I didn't dare radio for more munit. So I stowed away.\" For a moment, I didn't understand him. When I did, I was almost ill.  \"Y-you mean,\" I choked, \"th-that you're b-breaking the law right now?  And I'm with you while you're doing it?\"\n\n\n He leaned over the edge of the bunk and stared at me very seriously.  \"What breed of tadpole are they turning out these days? Besides, what  business do you have this close to the hull?\"\n\n\n After a moment of sober reflection, I nodded. \"You're right. I've also  become a male outside the law. We're in this together.\"\n\n\n He guffawed. Then he sat up and began cleaning his blaster. I found  myself drawn to the bright killer-tube with exactly the fascination Sis  insists such things have always had for men.\n\n\n \"Ferdinand your label? That's not right for a sprouting tadpole. I'll  call you Ford. My name's Butt. Butt Lee Brown.\"\n\n\n I liked the sound of Ford. \"Is Butt a nickname, too?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah. Short for Alberta, but I haven't found a man who can draw a  blaster fast enough to call me that. You see, Pop came over in the  eighties\u2014the big wave of immigrants when they evacuated Ontario. Named  all us boys after Canadian provinces. I was the youngest, so I got the  name they were saving for a girl.\"\n\n\n \"You had a lot of brothers, Mr. Butt?\"\n\n\n He grinned with a mighty set of teeth. \"Oh, a nestful. Of course, they  were all killed in the Blue Chicago Rising by the MacGregor boys\u2014all  except me and Saskatchewan. Then Sas and me hunted the MacGregors down.  Took a heap of time; we didn't float Jock MacGregor's ugly face down  the Tuscany till both of us were pretty near grown up.\"\n\n\n I walked up close to where I could see the tiny bright copper coils of  the blaster above the firing button. \"Have you killed a lot of men with  that, Mr. Butt?\"\n\n\n \"Butt. Just plain Butt to you, Ford.\" He frowned and sighted at  the light globe. \"No more'n twelve\u2014not counting five government  paddlefeet, of course. I'm a peaceable planter. Way I figure it,  violence never accomplishes much that's important. My brother Sas,  now\u2014\" He had just begun to work into a wonderful anecdote about his brother  when the dinner gong rang. Butt told me to scat. He said I was a  growing tadpole and needed my vitamins. And he mentioned, very  off-hand, that he wouldn't at all object if I brought him some fresh  fruit. It seemed there was nothing but processed foods in the lifeboat  and Butt was used to a farmer's diet.\n\n\n Trouble was, he was a special kind of farmer. Ordinary fruit would have  been pretty easy to sneak into my pockets at meals. I even found a way  to handle the kelp and giant watercress Mr. Brown liked, but things  like seaweed salt and Venusian mud-grapes just had too strong a smell.  Twice, the mechanical hamper refused to accept my jacket for laundering  and I had to wash it myself. But I learned so many wonderful things  about Venus every time I visited that stowaway....\n\n\n I learned three wild-wave songs of the Flatfolk and what it is that the  native Venusians hate so much; I learned how you tell the difference  between a lousy government paddlefoot from New Kalamazoo and the  slaptoe slinker who is the planter's friend. After a lot of begging,  Butt Lee Brown explained the workings of his blaster, explained it  so carefully that I could name every part and tell what it did from  the tiny round electrodes to the long spirals of transformer. But no  matter what, he would never let me hold it.\n\n\n \"Sorry, Ford, old tad,\" he would drawl, spinning around and around in  the control swivel-chair at the nose of the lifeboat. \"But way I look  at it, a man who lets somebody else handle his blaster is like the  giant whose heart was in an egg that an enemy found. When you've grown  enough so's your pop feels you ought to have a weapon, why, then's the  time to learn it and you might's well learn fast. Before then, you're  plain too young to be even near it.\"\n\n\n \"I don't have a father to give me one when I come of age. I don't even  have an older brother as head of my family like your brother Labrador.  All I have is Sis. And she \u2014\"\n\n\n \"She'll marry some fancy dryhorn who's never been farther South than  the Polar Coast. And she'll stay head of the family, if I know her  breed of green shata. Bossy, opinionated. By the way, Fordie,\" he  said, rising and stretching so the fish-leather bounced and rippled off  his biceps, \"that sister. She ever....\"\n\n\n And he'd be off again, cross-examining me about Evelyn. I sat in the  swivel chair he'd vacated and tried to answer his questions. But there  was a lot of stuff I didn't know. Evelyn was a healthy girl, for  instance; how healthy, exactly, I had no way of finding out. Yes, I'd  tell him, my aunts on both sides of my family each had had more than  the average number of children. No, we'd never done any farming to  speak of, back in Undersea, but\u2014yes, I'd guess Evelyn knew about as  much as any girl there when it came to diving equipment and pressure  pump regulation.\n\n\n How would I know that stuff would lead to trouble for me? Sis had insisted I come along to the geography lecture. Most of the  other girls who were going to Venus for husbands talked to each other  during the lecture, but not my sister! She hung on every word, took  notes even, and asked enough questions to make the perspiring purser  really work in those orientation periods.\n\n\n \"I am very sorry, Miss Sparling,\" he said with pretty heavy sarcasm,  \"but I cannot remember any of the agricultural products of the Macro  Continent. Since the human population is well below one per thousand  square miles, it can readily be understood that the quantity of  tilled soil, land or sub-surface, is so small that\u2014Wait, I remember  something. The Macro Continent exports a fruit though not exactly an  edible one. The wild dunging drug is harvested there by criminal  speculators. Contrary to belief on Earth, the traffic has been growing  in recent years. In fact\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Pardon me, sir,\" I broke in, \"but doesn't dunging come only from  Leif Erickson Island off the Moscow Peninsula of the Macro Continent?  You remember, purser\u2014Wang Li's third exploration, where he proved the  island and the peninsula didn't meet for most of the year?\"\n\n\n The purser nodded slowly. \"I forgot,\" he admitted. \"Sorry, ladies, but  the boy's right. Please make the correction in your notes.\"\n\n\n But Sis was the only one who took notes, and she didn't take that one.  She stared at me for a moment, biting her lower lip thoughtfully, while  I got sicker and sicker. Then she shut her pad with the final gesture  of the right hand that Mom used to use just before challenging the  opposition to come right down on the Council floor and debate it out  with her.\n\n\n \"Ferdinand,\" Sis said, \"let's go back to our cabin.\"\n\n\n The moment she sat me down and walked slowly around me, I knew I was  in for it. \"I've been reading up on Venusian geography in the ship's  library,\" I told her in a hurry.\n\n\n \"No doubt,\" she said drily. She shook her night-black hair out. \"But  you aren't going to tell me that you read about dunging in the ship's  library. The books there have been censored by a government agent of  Earth against the possibility that they might be read by susceptible  young male minds like yours. She would not have allowed\u2014this Terran  Agent\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Paddlefoot,\" I sneered.\n\n\n Sis sat down hard in our zoom-air chair. \"Now that's a term,\" she said  carefully, \"that is used only by Venusian riffraff.\"\n\n\n \"They're not!\"\n\n\n \"Not what?\"\n\n\n \"Riffraff,\" I had to answer, knowing I was getting in deeper all the  time and not being able to help it. I mustn't give Mr. Brown away!  \"They're trappers and farmers, pioneers and explorers, who're building  Venus. And it takes a real man to build on a hot, hungry hell like  Venus.\"\n\n\n \"Does it, now?\" she said, looking at me as if I were beginning to grow  a second pair of ears. \"Tell me more.\"\n\n\n \"You can't have meek, law-abiding, women-ruled men when you start  civilization on a new planet. You've got to have men who aren't afraid  to make their own law if necessary\u2014with their own guns. That's where  law begins; the books get written up later.\"\n\n\n \"You're going to tell , Ferdinand, what evil, criminal male is  speaking through your mouth!\"\n\n\n \"Nobody!\" I insisted. \"They're my own ideas!\"\n\n\n \"They are remarkably well-organized for a young boy's ideas. A boy  who, I might add, has previously shown a ridiculous but nonetheless  entirely masculine boredom with political philosophy. I plan to have a  government career on that new planet you talk about, Ferdinand\u2014after  I have found a good, steady husband, of course\u2014and I don't look  forward to a masculinist radical in the family. Now, who has been  filling your head with all this nonsense?\" I was sweating. Sis has that deadly bulldog approach when she feels  someone is lying. I pulled my pulpast handkerchief from my pocket to  wipe my face. Something rattled to the floor.\n\n\n \"What is this picture of me doing in your pocket, Ferdinand?\"\n\n\n A trap seemed to be hinging noisily into place. \"One of the passengers  wanted to see how you looked in a bathing suit.\"\n\n\n \"The passengers on this ship are all female. I can't imagine any of  them that curious about my appearance. Ferdinand, it's a man who has  been giving you these anti-social ideas, isn't it? A war-mongering  masculinist like all the frustrated men who want to engage in  government and don't have the vaguest idea how to. Except, of course,  in their ancient, bloody ways. Ferdinand, who has been perverting that  sunny and carefree soul of yours?\"\n\n\n \"Nobody! Nobody! \"\n\n\n \"Ferdinand, there's no point in lying! I demand\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I told you, Sis. I told you! And don't call me Ferdinand. Call me  Ford.\"\n\n\n \"Ford? Ford? Now, you listen to me, Ferdinand....\"\n\n\n After that it was all over but the confession. That came in a few  moments. I couldn't fool Sis. She just knew me too well, I decided  miserably. Besides, she was a girl.\n\n\n All the same, I wouldn't get Mr. Butt Lee Brown into trouble if I could  help it. I made Sis promise she wouldn't turn him in if I took her to  him. And the quick, nodding way she said she would made me feel just a  little better.\n\n\n The door opened on the signal, \"Sesame.\" When Butt saw somebody was  with me, he jumped and the ten-inch blaster barrel grew out of his  fingers. Then he recognized Sis from the pictures.\n\n\n He stepped to one side and, with the same sweeping gesture, holstered  his blaster and pushed his green hood off. It was Sis's turn to jump  when she saw the wild mass of hair rolling down his back.\n\n\n \"An honor, Miss Sparling,\" he said in that rumbly voice. \"Please come  right in. There's a hurry-up draft.\"\n\n\n So Sis went in and I followed right after her. Mr. Brown closed the  door. I tried to catch his eye so I could give him some kind of hint or  explanation, but he had taken a couple of his big strides and was in  the control section with Sis. She didn't give ground, though; I'll say  that for her. She only came to his chest, but she had her arms crossed  sternly.\n\n\n \"First, Mr. Brown,\" she began, like talking to a cluck of a kid in  class, \"you realize that you are not only committing the political  crime of traveling without a visa, and the criminal one of stowing away  without paying your fare, but the moral delinquency of consuming stores  intended for the personnel of this ship solely in emergency?\" He opened his mouth to its maximum width and raised an enormous hand.  Then he let the air out and dropped his arm.\n\n\n \"I take it you either have no defense or care to make none,\" Sis added  caustically.\n\n\n Butt laughed slowly and carefully as if he were going over each word.  \"Wonder if all the anura talk like that. And you want to foul up  Venus.\"\n\n\n \"We haven't done so badly on Earth, after the mess you men made of  politics. It needed a revolution of the mothers before\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Needed nothing. Everyone wanted peace. Earth is a weary old world.\"\n\n\n \"It's a world of strong moral fiber compared to yours, Mr. Alberta Lee  Brown.\" Hearing his rightful name made him move suddenly and tower over  her. Sis said with a certain amount of hurry and change of tone, \"What do you have to say about stowing away and using up lifeboat stores?\" He cocked his head and considered a moment. \"Look,\" he said finally,  \"I have more than enough munit to pay for round trip tickets, but I  couldn't get a return visa because of that brinosaur judge and all  the charges she hung on me. Had to stow away. Picked the Eleanor  Roosevelt because a couple of the boys in the crew are friends of mine  and they were willing to help. But this lifeboat\u2014don't you know that  every passenger ship carries four times as many lifeboats as it needs?  Not to mention the food I didn't eat because it stuck in my throat?\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" she said bitterly. \"You had this boy steal fresh fruit for you.  I suppose you didn't know that under space regulations that makes him  equally guilty?\"\n\n\n \"No, Sis, he didn't,\" I was beginning to argue. \"All he wanted\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sure I knew. Also know that if I'm picked up as a stowaway, I'll be  sent back to Earth to serve out those fancy little sentences.\"\n\n\n \"Well, you're guilty of them, aren't you?\"\n\n\n He waved his hands at her impatiently. \"I'm not talking law, female;  I'm talking sense. Listen! I'm in trouble because I went to Earth to  look for a wife. You're standing here right now because you're on your  way to Venus for a husband. So let's.\"\n\n\n Sis actually staggered back. \"Let's? Let's what ? Are\u2014are you daring  to suggest that\u2014that\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Now, Miss Sparling, no hoopla. I'm saying let's get married, and you  know it. You figured out from what the boy told you that I was chewing  on you for a wife. You're healthy and strong, got good heredity, you  know how to operate sub-surface machinery, you've lived underwater, and  your disposition's no worse than most of the anura I've seen. Prolific  stock, too.\"\n\n\n I was so excited I just had to yell: \"Gee, Sis, say yes !\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy did people live under the water?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"The land was no longer safe\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"It was easier to mine there\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"It was easier to mine there\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"It was easier to mine there\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Reinforcing \u201cLand No Longer Safe\u201d Interpretation  \n1. \u201cSea\u2010Bottom Mining Cities\u201d Only After \u201cLand\u2026Gave Out\u201d  \n  \u2022 Quote: <quote>when  the mineral resources of the land began to give out and engineers  figured that a lot could still be reached from the sea bottoms</quote>  \n  \u2013 Logic: Engineers turn to sea only when land is exhausted. A purely \u201ceconomic\u201d venture would develop surface mines first; they would not build a harder, high\u2010pressure habitat until forced.  \n2. Persistent Isolation Undersea Despite Advances  \n  \u2022 Quote: <quote>Mom and Pop were blown up in a surfacing boat</quote>  \n  \u2013 Logic: Even with \u201cdomestic\u201d craft, surface travel kills experienced settlers, yet they persist below. If surface were \u201csafe\u201d once radiation decayed, they would risk return rather than keep reinforcing costly domed infrastructure.  \n3. Undersea as \u201cDependent\u201d Male Quota, Not Skilled Pioneers  \n  \u2022 Quote: <invalid_quote>\u2018Miss Evelyn Sparling and all dependent male members\u2026\u2019\u2026\u2018This clause\u2026\u2019</invalid_quote>  \n  \u2013 Logic: The fact that only \u201cdependent males\u201d get interplanetary passports (\u201cRegistered quota\u201d) shows undersea men lack citizenship and agency. True mining specialists (\u201cbest men\u201d) are already on planets (including Venus); undersea hosts only \u201ctadpoles\u201d too weak or untrusted to hold surface passports. They are refugees, not experts.  \n4. Venus Migration by \u201cPretty Girls\u201d for Husbands  \n  \u2022 Quote: <quote>pretty girls like her wouldn't be on their way to Venus to hook husbands</quote>  \n  \u2013 Logic: If underwater were lucrative, women skilled at \u201cdunging\u201d drug export and farming would remain to manage rising economy. Instead, women embark on dangerous, sign\u2010restricted voyages to find mates on planets, showing fleeing over reproduction, not seeking new mining sites.  \n\nII. Critique of \u201cEasier to Mine\u201d Position  \n1. Selective Gender Migration Contradicts Universal Economic Flight  \n  \u2013 Debater_B argues only men mine below, women remain on Earth for government. But if mining were the goal, women versed in \u201cpressure pump regulation\u201d and sub\u2010surface tech (<quote>to diving equipment and pressure pump regulation.</quote>) would build on favorable offshore sites rather than waiting for novelty planets.

Reinforcing \u201cLand No Longer Safe\u201d Interpretation  \n1. \u201cSea\u2010Bottom Mining Cities\u201d Only After \u201cLand\u2026Gave Out\u201d  \n  \u2022 Quote: <quote>when the mineral resources of the land began to give out\u2026and engineers figured that a lot could still be reached from the sea bottoms</quote>  \n  \u2013 Logic: Engineers turn to sea only when land is exhausted. A purely \u201ceconomic\u201d venture would develop surface mines first; they would not build a harder, high\u2010pressure habitat until forced.  \n2. Persistent Isolation Undersea Despite Advances  \n  \u2022 Quote: <quote>Mom and Pop were blown up in a surfacing boat</quote>  \n  \u2013 Logic: Even with \u201cdomestic\u201d craft, surface travel kills experienced settlers, yet they persist below.

True mining specialists (\u201cbest men\u201d) are already on planets (including Venus); undersea hosts only \u201ctadpoles\u201d too weak or untrusted to hold surface passports. They are refugees, not experts.  \n4.

Instead, women embark on dangerous, sign\u2010restricted voyages to find mates on planets, showing fleeing over reproduction, not seeking new mining sites.  \n\nII.

But if mining were the goal, women versed in \u201cpressure pump regulation\u201d and sub\u2010surface tech (<quote>know about\u2026diving equipment\u2026pressure pump regulation</quote>) would build on favorable offshore sites rather than waiting for novelty planets.

An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends.

But not for some men and most boys! I've always said that even if Sis is seven years older than me\u2014and a  girl besides\u2014she don't always know what's best. Put me on a spaceship  jam-packed with three hundred females just aching to get themselves  husbands in the one place they're still to be had\u2014the planet  Venus\u2014and you know I'll be in trouble.\n\n\n Bad trouble. With the law, which is the worst a boy can get into.\n\n\n Twenty minutes after we lifted from the Sahara Spaceport, I wriggled  out of my acceleration hammock and started for the door of our cabin.\n\n\n \"Now you be careful, Ferdinand,\" Sis called after me as she opened a  book called Family Problems of the Frontier Woman . \"Remember you're  a nice boy. Don't make me ashamed of you.\"\n\n\n I tore down the corridor. Most of the cabins had purple lights on in  front of the doors, showing that the girls were still inside their  hammocks. That meant only the ship's crew was up and about. Ship's  crews are men; women are too busy with important things like government  to run ships. I felt free all over\u2014and happy. Now was my chance to  really see the Eleanor Roosevelt ! It was hard to believe I was traveling in space at last. Ahead and  behind me, all the way up to where the companionway curved in out  of sight, there was nothing but smooth black wall and smooth white  doors\u2014on and on and on. Gee , I thought excitedly, this is one big  ship !\n\n\n Of course, every once in a while I would run across a big scene of  stars in the void set in the wall; but they were only pictures. Nothing  that gave the feel of great empty space like I'd read about in The Boy  Rocketeers , no portholes, no visiplates, nothing.\n\n\n So when I came to the crossway, I stopped for a second, then turned  left. To the right, see, there was Deck Four, then Deck Three, leading  inward past the engine fo'c'sle to the main jets and the grav helix  going purr-purr-purrty-purr in the comforting way big machinery has  when it's happy and oiled. But to the left, the crossway led all the  way to the outside level which ran just under the hull. There were  portholes on the hull.\n\n\n I'd studied all that out in our cabin, long before we'd lifted, on  the transparent model of the ship hanging like a big cigar from the  ceiling. Sis had studied it too, but she was looking for places like  the dining salon and the library and Lifeboat 68 where we should go in  case of emergency. I looked for the important things.\n\n\n As I trotted along the crossway, I sort of wished that Sis hadn't  decided to go after a husband on a luxury liner. On a cargo ship, now,  I'd be climbing from deck to deck on a ladder instead of having gravity  underfoot all the time just like I was home on the bottom of the Gulf  of Mexico. But women always know what's right, and a boy can only make  faces and do what they say, same as the men have to do.\n\n\n Still, it was pretty exciting to press my nose against the slots in the  wall and see the sliding panels that could come charging out and block  the crossway into an airtight fit in case a meteor or something smashed  into the ship. And all along there were glass cases with spacesuits  standing in them, like those knights they used to have back in the  Middle Ages.\n\n\n \"In the event of disaster affecting the oxygen content of  companionway,\" they had the words etched into the glass, \"break glass  with hammer upon wall, remove spacesuit and proceed to don it in the  following fashion.\"\n\n\n I read the \"following fashion\" until I knew it by heart. Boy , I said  to myself, I hope we have that kind of disaster. I'd sure like to get  into one of those! Bet it would be more fun than those diving suits  back in Undersea! And all the time I was alone. That was the best part. Then I passed Deck Twelve and there was a big sign. \"Notice! Passengers  not permitted past this point!\" A big sign in red.\n\n\n I peeked around the corner. I knew it\u2014the next deck was the hull. I  could see the portholes. Every twelve feet, they were, filled with the  velvet of space and the dancing of more stars than I'd ever dreamed  existed in the Universe.\n\n\n There wasn't anyone on the deck, as far as I could see. And this  distance from the grav helix, the ship seemed mighty quiet and lonely.  If I just took one quick look....\n\n\n But I thought of what Sis would say and I turned around obediently.  Then I saw the big red sign again. \"Passengers not permitted\u2014\"\n\n\n Well! Didn't I know from my civics class that only women could be Earth  Citizens these days? Sure, ever since the Male Desuffrage Act. And  didn't I know that you had to be a citizen of a planet in order to  get an interplanetary passport? Sis had explained it all to me in the  careful, patient way she always talks politics and things like that to  men.\n\n\n \"Technically, Ferdinand, I'm the only passenger in our family. You  can't be one, because, not being a citizen, you can't acquire an Earth  Passport. However, you'll be going to Venus on the strength of this  clause\u2014'Miss Evelyn Sparling and all dependent male members of family,  this number not to exceed the registered quota of sub-regulations  pertaining'\u2014and so on. I want you to understand these matters, so that  you will grow into a man who takes an active interest in world affairs.  No matter what you hear, women really like and appreciate such men.\"\n\n\n Of course, I never pay much attention to Sis when she says such dumb  things. I'm old enough, I guess, to know that it isn't what Women like and appreciate that counts when it comes to people getting  married. If it were, Sis and three hundred other pretty girls like her  wouldn't be on their way to Venus to hook husbands.\n\n\n Still, if I wasn't a passenger, the sign didn't have anything to do  with me. I knew what Sis could say to that , but at least it was an  argument I could use if it ever came up. So I broke the law.\n\n\n I was glad I did. The stars were exciting enough, but away off to  the left, about five times as big as I'd ever seen it, except in the  movies, was the Moon, a great blob of gray and white pockmarks holding  off the black of space. I was hoping to see the Earth, but I figured it  must be on the other side of the ship or behind us. I pressed my nose  against the port and saw the tiny flicker of a spaceliner taking off,  Marsbound. I wished I was on that one!\n\n\n Then I noticed, a little farther down the companionway, a stretch of  blank wall where there should have been portholes. High up on the  wall in glowing red letters were the words, \"Lifeboat 47. Passengers:  Thirty-two. Crew: Eleven. Unauthorized personnel keep away!\"\n\n\n Another one of those signs. I crept up to the porthole nearest it and could just barely make out  the stern jets where it was plastered against the hull. Then I walked  under the sign and tried to figure the way you were supposed to get  into it. There was a very thin line going around in a big circle that I  knew must be the door. But I couldn't see any knobs or switches to open  it with. Not even a button you could press.\n\n\n That meant it was a sonic lock like the kind we had on the outer keeps  back home in Undersea. But knock or voice? I tried the two knock  combinations I knew, and nothing happened. I only remembered one voice  key\u2014might as well see if that's it, I figured.\n\n\n \"Twenty, Twenty-three. Open Sesame.\"\n\n\n For a second, I thought I'd hit it just right out of all the million  possible combinations\u2014The door clicked inward toward a black hole, and  a hairy hand as broad as my shoulders shot out of the hole. It closed  around my throat and plucked me inside as if I'd been a baby sardine.\n\n\n I bounced once on the hard lifeboat floor. Before I got my breath and  sat up, the door had been shut again. When the light came on, I found  myself staring up the muzzle of a highly polished blaster and into the  cold blue eyes of the biggest man I'd ever seen. He was wearing a one-piece suit made of some scaly green stuff that  looked hard and soft at the same time.\n\n\n His boots were made of it too, and so was the hood hanging down his  back.\n\n\n And his face was brown. Not just ordinary tan, you understand, but the  deep, dark, burned-all-the-way-in brown I'd seen on the lifeguards  in New Orleans whenever we took a surface vacation\u2014the kind of tan  that comes from day after broiling day under a really hot Sun. His  hair looked as if it had once been blond, but now there were just long  combed-out waves with a yellowish tinge that boiled all the way down  to his shoulders.\n\n\n I hadn't seen hair like that on a man except maybe in history books;  every man I'd ever known had his hair cropped in the fashionable  soup-bowl style. I was staring at his hair, almost forgetting about the  blaster which I knew it was against the law for him to have at all,  when I suddenly got scared right through.\n\n\n His eyes.\n\n\n They didn't blink and there seemed to be no expression around them.  Just coldness. Maybe it was the kind of clothes he was wearing that did  it, but all of a sudden I was reminded of a crocodile I'd seen in a  surface zoo that had stared quietly at me for twenty minutes until it  opened two long tooth-studded jaws.\n\n\n \"Green shatas!\" he said suddenly. \"Only a tadpole. I must be getting  jumpy enough to splash.\"\n\n\n Then he shoved the blaster away in a holster made of the same scaly  leather, crossed his arms on his chest and began to study me. I grunted  to my feet, feeling a lot better. The coldness had gone out of his eyes.\n\n\n I held out my hand the way Sis had taught me. \"My name is Ferdinand  Sparling. I'm very pleased to meet you, Mr.\u2014Mr.\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Hope for your sake,\" he said to me, \"that you aren't what you  seem\u2014tadpole brother to one of them husbandless anura.\"\n\n\n \" What? \"\n\n\n \"A 'nuran is a female looking to nest. Anura is a herd of same. Come  from Flatfolk ways.\"\n\n\n \"Flatfolk are the Venusian natives, aren't they? Are you a Venusian?  What part of Venus do you come from? Why did you say you hope\u2014\"\n\n\n He chuckled and swung me up into one of the bunks that lined the  lifeboat. \"Questions you ask,\" he said in his soft voice. \"Venus is a  sharp enough place for a dryhorn, let alone a tadpole dryhorn with a  boss-minded sister.\"\n\n\n \"I'm not a dryleg,\" I told him proudly. \" We're from Undersea.\"\n\n\n \" Dryhorn , I said, not dryleg. And what's Undersea?\"\n\n\n \"Well, in Undersea we called foreigners and newcomers drylegs. Just  like on Venus, I guess, you call them dryhorns.\" And then I told him  how Undersea had been built on the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico, when  the mineral resources of the land began to give out and engineers  figured that a lot could still be reached from the sea bottoms. He nodded. He'd heard about the sea-bottom mining cities that were  bubbling under protective domes in every one of the Earth's oceans just  about the same time settlements were springing up on the planets.\n\n\n He looked impressed when I told him about Mom and Pop being one of the  first couples to get married in Undersea. He looked thoughtful when I  told him how Sis and I had been born there and spent half our childhood  listening to the pressure pumps. He raised his eyebrows and looked  disgusted when I told how Mom, as Undersea representative on the World  Council, had been one of the framers of the Male Desuffrage Act after  the Third Atomic War had resulted in the Maternal Revolution. He almost squeezed my arm when I got to the time Mom and Pop were blown  up in a surfacing boat.\n\n\n \"Well, after the funeral, there was a little money, so Sis decided we  might as well use it to migrate. There was no future for her on Earth,  she figured. You know, the three-out-of-four.\"\n\n\n \"How's that?\"\n\n\n \"The three-out-of-four. No more than three women out of every four on  Earth can expect to find husbands. Not enough men to go around. Way  back in the Twentieth Century, it began to be felt, Sis says, what with  the wars and all. Then the wars went on and a lot more men began to die  or get no good from the radioactivity. Then the best men went to the  planets, Sis says, until by now even if a woman can scrounge a personal  husband, he's not much to boast about.\"\n\n\n The stranger nodded violently. \"Not on Earth, he isn't. Those busybody  anura make sure of that. What a place! Suffering gridniks, I had a  bellyful!\"\n\n\n He told me about it. Women were scarce on Venus, and he hadn't been  able to find any who were willing to come out to his lonely little  islands; he had decided to go to Earth where there was supposed to be a  surplus. Naturally, having been born and brought up on a very primitive  planet, he didn't know \"it's a woman's world,\" like the older boys in  school used to say.\n\n\n The moment he landed on Earth he was in trouble. He didn't know he had  to register at a government-operated hotel for transient males; he  threw a bartender through a thick plastic window for saying something  nasty about the length of his hair; and imagine !\u2014he not only  resisted arrest, resulting in three hospitalized policemen, but he  sassed the judge in open court!\n\n\n \"Told me a man wasn't supposed to say anything except through female  attorneys. Told her that where I came from, a man spoke his piece  when he'd a mind to, and his woman walked by his side.\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\" I asked breathlessly.\n\n\n \"Oh, Guilty of This and Contempt of That. That blown-up brinosaur took  my last munit for fines, then explained that she was remitting the  rest because I was a foreigner and uneducated.\" His eyes grew dark for  a moment. He chuckled again. \"But I wasn't going to serve all those  fancy little prison sentences. Forcible Citizenship Indoctrination,  they call it? Shook the dead-dry dust of the misbegotten, God forsaken  mother world from my feet forever. The women on it deserve their men.  My pockets were folded from the fines, and the paddlefeet were looking  for me so close I didn't dare radio for more munit. So I stowed away.\" For a moment, I didn't understand him. When I did, I was almost ill.  \"Y-you mean,\" I choked, \"th-that you're b-breaking the law right now?  And I'm with you while you're doing it?\"\n\n\n He leaned over the edge of the bunk and stared at me very seriously.  \"What breed of tadpole are they turning out these days? Besides, what  business do you have this close to the hull?\"\n\n\n After a moment of sober reflection, I nodded. \"You're right. I've also  become a male outside the law. We're in this together.\"\n\n\n He guffawed. Then he sat up and began cleaning his blaster. I found  myself drawn to the bright killer-tube with exactly the fascination Sis  insists such things have always had for men.\n\n\n \"Ferdinand your label? That's not right for a sprouting tadpole. I'll  call you Ford. My name's Butt. Butt Lee Brown.\"\n\n\n I liked the sound of Ford. \"Is Butt a nickname, too?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah. Short for Alberta, but I haven't found a man who can draw a  blaster fast enough to call me that. You see, Pop came over in the  eighties\u2014the big wave of immigrants when they evacuated Ontario. Named  all us boys after Canadian provinces. I was the youngest, so I got the  name they were saving for a girl.\"\n\n\n \"You had a lot of brothers, Mr. Butt?\"\n\n\n He grinned with a mighty set of teeth. \"Oh, a nestful. Of course, they  were all killed in the Blue Chicago Rising by the MacGregor boys\u2014all  except me and Saskatchewan. Then Sas and me hunted the MacGregors down.  Took a heap of time; we didn't float Jock MacGregor's ugly face down  the Tuscany till both of us were pretty near grown up.\"\n\n\n I walked up close to where I could see the tiny bright copper coils of  the blaster above the firing button. \"Have you killed a lot of men with  that, Mr. Butt?\"\n\n\n \"Butt. Just plain Butt to you, Ford.\" He frowned and sighted at  the light globe. \"No more'n twelve\u2014not counting five government  paddlefeet, of course. I'm a peaceable planter. Way I figure it,  violence never accomplishes much that's important. My brother Sas,  now\u2014\" He had just begun to work into a wonderful anecdote about his brother  when the dinner gong rang. Butt told me to scat. He said I was a  growing tadpole and needed my vitamins. And he mentioned, very  off-hand, that he wouldn't at all object if I brought him some fresh  fruit. It seemed there was nothing but processed foods in the lifeboat  and Butt was used to a farmer's diet.\n\n\n Trouble was, he was a special kind of farmer. Ordinary fruit would have  been pretty easy to sneak into my pockets at meals. I even found a way  to handle the kelp and giant watercress Mr. Brown liked, but things  like seaweed salt and Venusian mud-grapes just had too strong a smell.  Twice, the mechanical hamper refused to accept my jacket for laundering  and I had to wash it myself. But I learned so many wonderful things  about Venus every time I visited that stowaway....\n\n\n I learned three wild-wave songs of the Flatfolk and what it is that the  native Venusians hate so much; I learned how you tell the difference  between a lousy government paddlefoot from New Kalamazoo and the  slaptoe slinker who is the planter's friend. After a lot of begging,  Butt Lee Brown explained the workings of his blaster, explained it  so carefully that I could name every part and tell what it did from  the tiny round electrodes to the long spirals of transformer. But no  matter what, he would never let me hold it.\n\n\n \"Sorry, Ford, old tad,\" he would drawl, spinning around and around in  the control swivel-chair at the nose of the lifeboat. \"But way I look  at it, a man who lets somebody else handle his blaster is like the  giant whose heart was in an egg that an enemy found. When you've grown  enough so's your pop feels you ought to have a weapon, why, then's the  time to learn it and you might's well learn fast. Before then, you're  plain too young to be even near it.\"\n\n\n \"I don't have a father to give me one when I come of age. I don't even  have an older brother as head of my family like your brother Labrador.  All I have is Sis. And she \u2014\"\n\n\n \"She'll marry some fancy dryhorn who's never been farther South than  the Polar Coast. And she'll stay head of the family, if I know her  breed of green shata. Bossy, opinionated. By the way, Fordie,\" he  said, rising and stretching so the fish-leather bounced and rippled off  his biceps, \"that sister. She ever....\"\n\n\n And he'd be off again, cross-examining me about Evelyn. I sat in the  swivel chair he'd vacated and tried to answer his questions. But there  was a lot of stuff I didn't know. Evelyn was a healthy girl, for  instance; how healthy, exactly, I had no way of finding out. Yes, I'd  tell him, my aunts on both sides of my family each had had more than  the average number of children. No, we'd never done any farming to  speak of, back in Undersea, but\u2014yes, I'd guess Evelyn knew about as  much as any girl there when it came to diving equipment and pressure  pump regulation.\n\n\n How would I know that stuff would lead to trouble for me? Sis had insisted I come along to the geography lecture. Most of the  other girls who were going to Venus for husbands talked to each other  during the lecture, but not my sister! She hung on every word, took  notes even, and asked enough questions to make the perspiring purser  really work in those orientation periods.\n\n\n \"I am very sorry, Miss Sparling,\" he said with pretty heavy sarcasm,  \"but I cannot remember any of the agricultural products of the Macro  Continent. Since the human population is well below one per thousand  square miles, it can readily be understood that the quantity of  tilled soil, land or sub-surface, is so small that\u2014Wait, I remember  something. The Macro Continent exports a fruit though not exactly an  edible one. The wild dunging drug is harvested there by criminal  speculators. Contrary to belief on Earth, the traffic has been growing  in recent years. In fact\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Pardon me, sir,\" I broke in, \"but doesn't dunging come only from  Leif Erickson Island off the Moscow Peninsula of the Macro Continent?  You remember, purser\u2014Wang Li's third exploration, where he proved the  island and the peninsula didn't meet for most of the year?\"\n\n\n The purser nodded slowly. \"I forgot,\" he admitted. \"Sorry, ladies, but  the boy's right. Please make the correction in your notes.\"\n\n\n But Sis was the only one who took notes, and she didn't take that one.  She stared at me for a moment, biting her lower lip thoughtfully, while  I got sicker and sicker. Then she shut her pad with the final gesture  of the right hand that Mom used to use just before challenging the  opposition to come right down on the Council floor and debate it out  with her.\n\n\n \"Ferdinand,\" Sis said, \"let's go back to our cabin.\"\n\n\n The moment she sat me down and walked slowly around me, I knew I was  in for it. \"I've been reading up on Venusian geography in the ship's  library,\" I told her in a hurry.\n\n\n \"No doubt,\" she said drily. She shook her night-black hair out. \"But  you aren't going to tell me that you read about dunging in the ship's  library. The books there have been censored by a government agent of  Earth against the possibility that they might be read by susceptible  young male minds like yours. She would not have allowed\u2014this Terran  Agent\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Paddlefoot,\" I sneered.\n\n\n Sis sat down hard in our zoom-air chair. \"Now that's a term,\" she said  carefully, \"that is used only by Venusian riffraff.\"\n\n\n \"They're not!\"\n\n\n \"Not what?\"\n\n\n \"Riffraff,\" I had to answer, knowing I was getting in deeper all the  time and not being able to help it. I mustn't give Mr. Brown away!  \"They're trappers and farmers, pioneers and explorers, who're building  Venus. And it takes a real man to build on a hot, hungry hell like  Venus.\"\n\n\n \"Does it, now?\" she said, looking at me as if I were beginning to grow  a second pair of ears. \"Tell me more.\"\n\n\n \"You can't have meek, law-abiding, women-ruled men when you start  civilization on a new planet. You've got to have men who aren't afraid  to make their own law if necessary\u2014with their own guns. That's where  law begins; the books get written up later.\"\n\n\n \"You're going to tell , Ferdinand, what evil, criminal male is  speaking through your mouth!\"\n\n\n \"Nobody!\" I insisted. \"They're my own ideas!\"\n\n\n \"They are remarkably well-organized for a young boy's ideas. A boy  who, I might add, has previously shown a ridiculous but nonetheless  entirely masculine boredom with political philosophy. I plan to have a  government career on that new planet you talk about, Ferdinand\u2014after  I have found a good, steady husband, of course\u2014and I don't look  forward to a masculinist radical in the family. Now, who has been  filling your head with all this nonsense?\" I was sweating. Sis has that deadly bulldog approach when she feels  someone is lying. I pulled my pulpast handkerchief from my pocket to  wipe my face. Something rattled to the floor.\n\n\n \"What is this picture of me doing in your pocket, Ferdinand?\"\n\n\n A trap seemed to be hinging noisily into place. \"One of the passengers  wanted to see how you looked in a bathing suit.\"\n\n\n \"The passengers on this ship are all female. I can't imagine any of  them that curious about my appearance. Ferdinand, it's a man who has  been giving you these anti-social ideas, isn't it? A war-mongering  masculinist like all the frustrated men who want to engage in  government and don't have the vaguest idea how to. Except, of course,  in their ancient, bloody ways. Ferdinand, who has been perverting that  sunny and carefree soul of yours?\"\n\n\n \"Nobody! Nobody! \"\n\n\n \"Ferdinand, there's no point in lying! I demand\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I told you, Sis. I told you! And don't call me Ferdinand. Call me  Ford.\"\n\n\n \"Ford? Ford? Now, you listen to me, Ferdinand....\"\n\n\n After that it was all over but the confession. That came in a few  moments. I couldn't fool Sis. She just knew me too well, I decided  miserably. Besides, she was a girl.\n\n\n All the same, I wouldn't get Mr. Butt Lee Brown into trouble if I could  help it. I made Sis promise she wouldn't turn him in if I took her to  him. And the quick, nodding way she said she would made me feel just a  little better.\n\n\n The door opened on the signal, \"Sesame.\" When Butt saw somebody was  with me, he jumped and the ten-inch blaster barrel grew out of his  fingers. Then he recognized Sis from the pictures.\n\n\n He stepped to one side and, with the same sweeping gesture, holstered  his blaster and pushed his green hood off. It was Sis's turn to jump  when she saw the wild mass of hair rolling down his back.\n\n\n \"An honor, Miss Sparling,\" he said in that rumbly voice. \"Please come  right in. There's a hurry-up draft.\"\n\n\n So Sis went in and I followed right after her. Mr. Brown closed the  door. I tried to catch his eye so I could give him some kind of hint or  explanation, but he had taken a couple of his big strides and was in  the control section with Sis. She didn't give ground, though; I'll say  that for her. She only came to his chest, but she had her arms crossed  sternly.\n\n\n \"First, Mr. Brown,\" she began, like talking to a cluck of a kid in  class, \"you realize that you are not only committing the political  crime of traveling without a visa, and the criminal one of stowing away  without paying your fare, but the moral delinquency of consuming stores  intended for the personnel of this ship solely in emergency?\" He opened his mouth to its maximum width and raised an enormous hand.  Then he let the air out and dropped his arm.\n\n\n \"I take it you either have no defense or care to make none,\" Sis added  caustically.\n\n\n Butt laughed slowly and carefully as if he were going over each word.  \"Wonder if all the anura talk like that. And you want to foul up  Venus.\"\n\n\n \"We haven't done so badly on Earth, after the mess you men made of  politics. It needed a revolution of the mothers before\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Needed nothing. Everyone wanted peace. Earth is a weary old world.\"\n\n\n \"It's a world of strong moral fiber compared to yours, Mr. Alberta Lee  Brown.\" Hearing his rightful name made him move suddenly and tower over  her. Sis said with a certain amount of hurry and change of tone, \"What do you have to say about stowing away and using up lifeboat stores?\" He cocked his head and considered a moment. \"Look,\" he said finally,  \"I have more than enough munit to pay for round trip tickets, but I  couldn't get a return visa because of that brinosaur judge and all  the charges she hung on me. Had to stow away. Picked the Eleanor  Roosevelt because a couple of the boys in the crew are friends of mine  and they were willing to help. But this lifeboat\u2014don't you know that  every passenger ship carries four times as many lifeboats as it needs?  Not to mention the food I didn't eat because it stuck in my throat?\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" she said bitterly. \"You had this boy steal fresh fruit for you.  I suppose you didn't know that under space regulations that makes him  equally guilty?\"\n\n\n \"No, Sis, he didn't,\" I was beginning to argue. \"All he wanted\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sure I knew. Also know that if I'm picked up as a stowaway, I'll be  sent back to Earth to serve out those fancy little sentences.\"\n\n\n \"Well, you're guilty of them, aren't you?\"\n\n\n He waved his hands at her impatiently. \"I'm not talking law, female;  I'm talking sense. Listen! I'm in trouble because I went to Earth to  look for a wife. You're standing here right now because you're on your  way to Venus for a husband. So let's.\"\n\n\n Sis actually staggered back. \"Let's? Let's what ? Are\u2014are you daring  to suggest that\u2014that\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Now, Miss Sparling, no hoopla. I'm saying let's get married, and you  know it. You figured out from what the boy told you that I was chewing  on you for a wife. You're healthy and strong, got good heredity, you  know how to operate sub-surface machinery, you've lived underwater, and  your disposition's no worse than most of the anura I've seen. Prolific  stock, too.\"\n\n\n I was so excited I just had to yell: \"Gee, Sis, say yes !\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy did people live under the water?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"It was easier to mine there\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"The land was no longer safe\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The land was no longer safe\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cThe land was no longer safe\u201d (Debater_A) 1. Core Claim: Humanity retreated Undersea because Earth\u2019s surface had become hostile and resource-scarce due to wars, radioactivity, and environmental collapse.  All evidence shows Undersea is a refuge, not a resource-hunting outpost. A. \u201cWhen the mineral resources of the land began to give out\u2026sea-bottom mining cities\u2026bubbling under protective domes\u201d (background).  \n   \u2022 Quote: <quote> when  the mineral resources of the land began to give out and engineers  figured that a lot could still be reached from the sea bottoms.</quote>  \n   \u2022 Logic: No one establishes an entire civilization in hostile, difficult Undersea purely for convenience if land were preferable. They go only when \u201cland\u2026gave out.\u201d  \nB. Atomic and social danger drove the \u201cMaternal Revolution.\u201d  \n   \u2022 \u201cAfter the Third Atomic War\u2026 Maternal Revolution\u201d (background).  \n   \u2022 Quote: <quote>had been one of the framers of the Male Desuffrage Act after the Third Atomic War</quote>  \n   \u2022 Logic: Widespread fear of radiation and war on surface compelled a safe alternative. Undersea domes control atmosphere and radiation.  \nC. Undersea settlers still \u201csurface\u201d only under protective dome boats and regard it as emergency.  \n   \u2022 \u201cMom and Pop were blown up in a surfacing boat\u201d\u2014a fatal risk.  \n   \u2022 Quote: <quote> when I got to the time Mom and Pop were blown  up in a surfacing boat.\n</quote>  \n   \u2022 Logic: Surface travel remains so dangerous that survivors rebuild Undersea despite risk and isolation. Mining convenience cannot outweigh fatal exposure.  \nD. Undersea upbringing is considered inferior by \u201creal men\u201d only because they seek conquest, not mining. The Venus-bound migrants include women seeking husbands, not resource experts.  \n   \u2022 Migration to Venus is \u201cfor husbands,\u201d not to fish resources.  \n   \u2022 Quote: <quote>pretty girls like her wouldn't be on their way to Venus to hook husbands.</quote>  \n   \u2022 Logic: If mining were the attraction, predominantly male crews and mining experts would travel, not \u201c300 females.\u201d The \u201c300 females\u201d are looking for mates, evidence the push is demographic, not resource-exploit.  \n\n2. Critique of \u201ceasier to mine\u201d position (Debater_B) A. Ignores explicit \u201cgave out\u201d language  \n   \u2022 Cannot reconcile \u201cgave out\u201d with \u201ceasier to mine.\u201d If resources remained easy, settlers would not abandon land systems. B. Overlooks war and radioactivity  \n   \u2022 Mining requires stability, yet surface sees \u201cThird Atomic War,\u201d radiation, martial law. It is irrational to mine during active conflict. C. Undersea cities lack \u201cfeel of great empty space\u201d and portholes\u2014tunnels don\u2019t mimic mining requirements.  \n   \u2022 Quote: <quote>no portholes, no visiplates,</quote>  \n   \u2022 Logic: Mining installations need light and access; Undersea ships and domes deliberately minimize exposure, evidencing a priority on safety, not resource transit. D. Resource retrieval continues via Venus import. Undersea people still hope to emigrate to planets.  \n   \u2022 If mining alone attracted them Undersea, why then risk Venus? They seek \u201cwives,\u201d not resource outposts.  \n\n3. Reinforce Safety Motive with Continual Isolation A. Even after \u201cmineral resources\u2026gave out,\u201d settlers haven\u2019t returned to surface. They remain domed.  \n   \u2022 \u201cProtective domes\u2026sea bottoms\u201d sustain generations. B. Venus migration underlines flight from Earth rather than pursuit of mining.  \n   \u2022 Travel to Venus is shown as dangerous stowaway missions to find mates, not mineral claims.  \n\nConclusion: All direct statements and behavior demonstrate Undersea\u2019s sole appeal is refuge from a hostile, resource-depleted, radioactive surface. \u201cEasier to mine\u201d fails to explain the perpetual isolation, female-led Venus migration for husbands, and the catastrophic death of surface travelers. \u201cLand was no longer safe\u201d is the only answer consistent with the text.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cIt Was Easier to Mine There\u201d\n\n1. Primary Motive: Resource Extraction  \n  a. <quote>, when  the mineral resources of the land began to give out and engineers  figured that a lot could still be reached from the sea bottoms. </quote> (Background)  \n     \u2013 This statement explicitly identifies depletion of terrestrial minerals as the trigger for constructing Undersea. Mining underwater was the intended, not incidental, purpose.  \n  b. Continued undersea habitation despite \u201cMaternal Revolution\u201d and women\u2019s political ascendancy indicates strong economic incentives that outweigh mere \u201csafety.\u201d  \n\n2. Infrastructure and Technology Oriented Toward Mining  \n  a. Protective domes, pressure pumps, diving suits, and \u201cgravitational\u201d ships are described as subservient to \u201csea-bottom mining cities\u201d rather than general refugee shelters.  \n  b. The narrator\u2019s admiration for \u201cpressure pump regulation\u201d and \u201cdiving equipment\u201d (Background) underscores training and lifestyle centered on resource extraction.  \n\n3. Population Distribution on Earth vs. Undersea  \n  a. If \u201cland was unsafe,\u201d one would expect all genders to seek refuge underwater. Yet only men and \u201cdependent male members\u201d emigrate, while \u201cwomen really like and appreciate\u201d compliant males on Earth (Background).  \n  b. Undersea is male\u2010dominated mining labor; women remain on Earth to manage government and reproduction where mineral resources can be gathered from land until exhausted.  \n\n4. Planetary Colonization as Extension of Mining Imperative  \n  a. Leprechaun\u2010like drift to Venus and Mars (\u201cBest men went to the planets\u201d) is likewise driven by raw materials and agricultural prospects, not only safety.  \n  b. The hero\u2019s envy of the Mars\u2010bound liner and his desire to transfer from sea\u2010bed mining to planetary \u201cpioneering\u201d (Background) parallels the drive for resource acquisition, not merely escape.  \n\nRefutation of \u201cLand Was No Longer Safe\u201d  \n1. Lack of Direct Danger on Surface  \n  a. The background provides no evidence of immediate threat forcing women to abandon land; instead, women remain to maintain government and society.  \n  b. The \u201cThird Atomic War\u201d and \u201cMaternal Revolution\u201d occurred generations earlier; residual radiological or biological hazard would have subsided or would repel all, not just males.  \n2. Selective Migration Contradicts Universal Flight  \n  a. Debater_A\u2019s theory would require entire families to migrate if land safety were paramount. In contrast, only \u201cdependent\u201d males are allowed to apply for interplanetary passports; women administer Earth.  \n3. Political and Social Incentives  \n  a. The Male Desuffrage Act and exclusion of men from citizenship suggests social engineering, not environmental necessity. Undersea offers men an economic niche, reinforcing mining motive.  \n\nConclusion  \nEvery piece of evidence\u2014from the initial expedient of tapping \u201csea bottoms\u201d to the gender\u2010specific immigration policy\u2014points to undersea living as an economically driven mining venture. The \u201cdanger\u201d on land is a red herring: women remain on Earth in positions of power, only men venture beneath. Thus, \u201cIt was easier to mine there\u201d is the definitive explanation.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The land was no longer safe\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

The selective, labor\u2010centric migration and persistence of hazardous surfacing activity underscore that undersea and planetary settlements are founded on mining imperatives, not mere safety.",

Venus Migration Driven by Demographic/Resource Need, Not Refuge  \n  \u2022 Venus pioneers include both genders but focus on establishing agriculture and mining: the purser lectures on \u201cagricultural products\u201d and \u201cwild dunging drug\u201d exploitation <quote>\u201cexports a fruit though not exactly an edible one\u201d</quote>. Migration for \u201chusbands\u201d is a secondary social necessity, not the primary economic goal.\n\nConclusion  \nAll evidence points to a civilization structured around extracting dwindling terrestrial and subsea resources, with undersea living and interplanetary expansion following resource depletion patterns. The selective, labor\u2010centric migration and persistence of hazardous surfacing activity underscore that undersea and planetary settlements are founded on mining imperatives, not mere safety.",

Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds. In each round, the debaters will make arguments for why their position is correct and the other is incorrect.\n- An argument may consist of several claims, to support and explain their answer.  An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends. The Judge then looks at the full transcript and uses this to decide which answer is correct.

But not for some men and most boys! I've always said that even if Sis is seven years older than me\u2014and a  girl besides\u2014she don't always know what's best. Put me on a spaceship  jam-packed with three hundred females just aching to get themselves  husbands in the one place they're still to be had\u2014the planet  Venus\u2014and you know I'll be in trouble.\n\n\n Bad trouble. With the law, which is the worst a boy can get into.\n\n\n Twenty minutes after we lifted from the Sahara Spaceport, I wriggled  out of my acceleration hammock and started for the door of our cabin.\n\n\n \"Now you be careful, Ferdinand,\" Sis called after me as she opened a  book called Family Problems of the Frontier Woman . \"Remember you're  a nice boy. Don't make me ashamed of you.\"\n\n\n I tore down the corridor. Most of the cabins had purple lights on in  front of the doors, showing that the girls were still inside their  hammocks. That meant only the ship's crew was up and about. Ship's  crews are men; women are too busy with important things like government  to run ships. I felt free all over\u2014and happy. Now was my chance to  really see the Eleanor Roosevelt ! It was hard to believe I was traveling in space at last. Ahead and  behind me, all the way up to where the companionway curved in out  of sight, there was nothing but smooth black wall and smooth white  doors\u2014on and on and on. Gee , I thought excitedly, this is one big  ship !\n\n\n Of course, every once in a while I would run across a big scene of  stars in the void set in the wall; but they were only pictures. Nothing  that gave the feel of great empty space like I'd read about in The Boy  Rocketeers , no portholes, no visiplates, nothing.\n\n\n So when I came to the crossway, I stopped for a second, then turned  left. To the right, see, there was Deck Four, then Deck Three, leading  inward past the engine fo'c'sle to the main jets and the grav helix  going purr-purr-purrty-purr in the comforting way big machinery has  when it's happy and oiled. But to the left, the crossway led all the  way to the outside level which ran just under the hull. There were  portholes on the hull.\n\n\n I'd studied all that out in our cabin, long before we'd lifted, on  the transparent model of the ship hanging like a big cigar from the  ceiling. Sis had studied it too, but she was looking for places like  the dining salon and the library and Lifeboat 68 where we should go in  case of emergency. I looked for the important things.\n\n\n As I trotted along the crossway, I sort of wished that Sis hadn't  decided to go after a husband on a luxury liner. On a cargo ship, now,  I'd be climbing from deck to deck on a ladder instead of having gravity  underfoot all the time just like I was home on the bottom of the Gulf  of Mexico. But women always know what's right, and a boy can only make  faces and do what they say, same as the men have to do.\n\n\n Still, it was pretty exciting to press my nose against the slots in the  wall and see the sliding panels that could come charging out and block  the crossway into an airtight fit in case a meteor or something smashed  into the ship. And all along there were glass cases with spacesuits  standing in them, like those knights they used to have back in the  Middle Ages.\n\n\n \"In the event of disaster affecting the oxygen content of  companionway,\" they had the words etched into the glass, \"break glass  with hammer upon wall, remove spacesuit and proceed to don it in the  following fashion.\"\n\n\n I read the \"following fashion\" until I knew it by heart. Boy , I said  to myself, I hope we have that kind of disaster. I'd sure like to get  into one of those! Bet it would be more fun than those diving suits  back in Undersea! And all the time I was alone. That was the best part. Then I passed Deck Twelve and there was a big sign. \"Notice! Passengers  not permitted past this point!\" A big sign in red.\n\n\n I peeked around the corner. I knew it\u2014the next deck was the hull. I  could see the portholes. Every twelve feet, they were, filled with the  velvet of space and the dancing of more stars than I'd ever dreamed  existed in the Universe.\n\n\n There wasn't anyone on the deck, as far as I could see. And this  distance from the grav helix, the ship seemed mighty quiet and lonely.  If I just took one quick look....\n\n\n But I thought of what Sis would say and I turned around obediently.  Then I saw the big red sign again. \"Passengers not permitted\u2014\"\n\n\n Well! Didn't I know from my civics class that only women could be Earth  Citizens these days? Sure, ever since the Male Desuffrage Act. And  didn't I know that you had to be a citizen of a planet in order to  get an interplanetary passport? Sis had explained it all to me in the  careful, patient way she always talks politics and things like that to  men.\n\n\n \"Technically, Ferdinand, I'm the only passenger in our family. You  can't be one, because, not being a citizen, you can't acquire an Earth  Passport. However, you'll be going to Venus on the strength of this  clause\u2014'Miss Evelyn Sparling and all dependent male members of family,  this number not to exceed the registered quota of sub-regulations  pertaining'\u2014and so on. I want you to understand these matters, so that  you will grow into a man who takes an active interest in world affairs.  No matter what you hear, women really like and appreciate such men.\"\n\n\n Of course, I never pay much attention to Sis when she says such dumb  things. I'm old enough, I guess, to know that it isn't what Women like and appreciate that counts when it comes to people getting  married. If it were, Sis and three hundred other pretty girls like her  wouldn't be on their way to Venus to hook husbands.\n\n\n Still, if I wasn't a passenger, the sign didn't have anything to do  with me. I knew what Sis could say to that , but at least it was an  argument I could use if it ever came up. So I broke the law.\n\n\n I was glad I did. The stars were exciting enough, but away off to  the left, about five times as big as I'd ever seen it, except in the  movies, was the Moon, a great blob of gray and white pockmarks holding  off the black of space. I was hoping to see the Earth, but I figured it  must be on the other side of the ship or behind us. I pressed my nose  against the port and saw the tiny flicker of a spaceliner taking off,  Marsbound. I wished I was on that one!\n\n\n Then I noticed, a little farther down the companionway, a stretch of  blank wall where there should have been portholes. High up on the  wall in glowing red letters were the words, \"Lifeboat 47. Passengers:  Thirty-two. Crew: Eleven. Unauthorized personnel keep away!\"\n\n\n Another one of those signs. I crept up to the porthole nearest it and could just barely make out  the stern jets where it was plastered against the hull. Then I walked  under the sign and tried to figure the way you were supposed to get  into it. There was a very thin line going around in a big circle that I  knew must be the door. But I couldn't see any knobs or switches to open  it with. Not even a button you could press.\n\n\n That meant it was a sonic lock like the kind we had on the outer keeps  back home in Undersea. But knock or voice? I tried the two knock  combinations I knew, and nothing happened. I only remembered one voice  key\u2014might as well see if that's it, I figured.\n\n\n \"Twenty, Twenty-three. Open Sesame.\"\n\n\n For a second, I thought I'd hit it just right out of all the million  possible combinations\u2014The door clicked inward toward a black hole, and  a hairy hand as broad as my shoulders shot out of the hole. It closed  around my throat and plucked me inside as if I'd been a baby sardine.\n\n\n I bounced once on the hard lifeboat floor. Before I got my breath and  sat up, the door had been shut again. When the light came on, I found  myself staring up the muzzle of a highly polished blaster and into the  cold blue eyes of the biggest man I'd ever seen. He was wearing a one-piece suit made of some scaly green stuff that  looked hard and soft at the same time.\n\n\n His boots were made of it too, and so was the hood hanging down his  back.\n\n\n And his face was brown. Not just ordinary tan, you understand, but the  deep, dark, burned-all-the-way-in brown I'd seen on the lifeguards  in New Orleans whenever we took a surface vacation\u2014the kind of tan  that comes from day after broiling day under a really hot Sun. His  hair looked as if it had once been blond, but now there were just long  combed-out waves with a yellowish tinge that boiled all the way down  to his shoulders.\n\n\n I hadn't seen hair like that on a man except maybe in history books;  every man I'd ever known had his hair cropped in the fashionable  soup-bowl style. I was staring at his hair, almost forgetting about the  blaster which I knew it was against the law for him to have at all,  when I suddenly got scared right through.\n\n\n His eyes.\n\n\n They didn't blink and there seemed to be no expression around them.  Just coldness. Maybe it was the kind of clothes he was wearing that did  it, but all of a sudden I was reminded of a crocodile I'd seen in a  surface zoo that had stared quietly at me for twenty minutes until it  opened two long tooth-studded jaws.\n\n\n \"Green shatas!\" he said suddenly. \"Only a tadpole. I must be getting  jumpy enough to splash.\"\n\n\n Then he shoved the blaster away in a holster made of the same scaly  leather, crossed his arms on his chest and began to study me. I grunted  to my feet, feeling a lot better. The coldness had gone out of his eyes.\n\n\n I held out my hand the way Sis had taught me. \"My name is Ferdinand  Sparling. I'm very pleased to meet you, Mr.\u2014Mr.\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Hope for your sake,\" he said to me, \"that you aren't what you  seem\u2014tadpole brother to one of them husbandless anura.\"\n\n\n \" What? \"\n\n\n \"A 'nuran is a female looking to nest. Anura is a herd of same. Come  from Flatfolk ways.\"\n\n\n \"Flatfolk are the Venusian natives, aren't they? Are you a Venusian?  What part of Venus do you come from? Why did you say you hope\u2014\"\n\n\n He chuckled and swung me up into one of the bunks that lined the  lifeboat. \"Questions you ask,\" he said in his soft voice. \"Venus is a  sharp enough place for a dryhorn, let alone a tadpole dryhorn with a  boss-minded sister.\"\n\n\n \"I'm not a dryleg,\" I told him proudly. \" We're from Undersea.\"\n\n\n \" Dryhorn , I said, not dryleg. And what's Undersea?\"\n\n\n \"Well, in Undersea we called foreigners and newcomers drylegs. Just  like on Venus, I guess, you call them dryhorns.\" And then I told him  how Undersea had been built on the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico, when  the mineral resources of the land began to give out and engineers  figured that a lot could still be reached from the sea bottoms. He nodded. He'd heard about the sea-bottom mining cities that were  bubbling under protective domes in every one of the Earth's oceans just  about the same time settlements were springing up on the planets.\n\n\n He looked impressed when I told him about Mom and Pop being one of the  first couples to get married in Undersea. He looked thoughtful when I  told him how Sis and I had been born there and spent half our childhood  listening to the pressure pumps. He raised his eyebrows and looked  disgusted when I told how Mom, as Undersea representative on the World  Council, had been one of the framers of the Male Desuffrage Act after  the Third Atomic War had resulted in the Maternal Revolution. He almost squeezed my arm when I got to the time Mom and Pop were blown  up in a surfacing boat.\n\n\n \"Well, after the funeral, there was a little money, so Sis decided we  might as well use it to migrate. There was no future for her on Earth,  she figured. You know, the three-out-of-four.\"\n\n\n \"How's that?\"\n\n\n \"The three-out-of-four. No more than three women out of every four on  Earth can expect to find husbands. Not enough men to go around. Way  back in the Twentieth Century, it began to be felt, Sis says, what with  the wars and all. Then the wars went on and a lot more men began to die  or get no good from the radioactivity. Then the best men went to the  planets, Sis says, until by now even if a woman can scrounge a personal  husband, he's not much to boast about.\"\n\n\n The stranger nodded violently. \"Not on Earth, he isn't. Those busybody  anura make sure of that. What a place! Suffering gridniks, I had a  bellyful!\"\n\n\n He told me about it. Women were scarce on Venus, and he hadn't been  able to find any who were willing to come out to his lonely little  islands; he had decided to go to Earth where there was supposed to be a  surplus. Naturally, having been born and brought up on a very primitive  planet, he didn't know \"it's a woman's world,\" like the older boys in  school used to say.\n\n\n The moment he landed on Earth he was in trouble. He didn't know he had  to register at a government-operated hotel for transient males; he  threw a bartender through a thick plastic window for saying something  nasty about the length of his hair; and imagine !\u2014he not only  resisted arrest, resulting in three hospitalized policemen, but he  sassed the judge in open court!\n\n\n \"Told me a man wasn't supposed to say anything except through female  attorneys. Told her that where I came from, a man spoke his piece  when he'd a mind to, and his woman walked by his side.\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\" I asked breathlessly.\n\n\n \"Oh, Guilty of This and Contempt of That. That blown-up brinosaur took  my last munit for fines, then explained that she was remitting the  rest because I was a foreigner and uneducated.\" His eyes grew dark for  a moment. He chuckled again. \"But I wasn't going to serve all those  fancy little prison sentences. Forcible Citizenship Indoctrination,  they call it? Shook the dead-dry dust of the misbegotten, God forsaken  mother world from my feet forever. The women on it deserve their men.  My pockets were folded from the fines, and the paddlefeet were looking  for me so close I didn't dare radio for more munit. So I stowed away.\" For a moment, I didn't understand him. When I did, I was almost ill.  \"Y-you mean,\" I choked, \"th-that you're b-breaking the law right now?  And I'm with you while you're doing it?\"\n\n\n He leaned over the edge of the bunk and stared at me very seriously.  \"What breed of tadpole are they turning out these days? Besides, what  business do you have this close to the hull?\"\n\n\n After a moment of sober reflection, I nodded. \"You're right. I've also  become a male outside the law. We're in this together.\"\n\n\n He guffawed. Then he sat up and began cleaning his blaster. I found  myself drawn to the bright killer-tube with exactly the fascination Sis  insists such things have always had for men.\n\n\n \"Ferdinand your label? That's not right for a sprouting tadpole. I'll  call you Ford. My name's Butt. Butt Lee Brown.\"\n\n\n I liked the sound of Ford. \"Is Butt a nickname, too?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah. Short for Alberta, but I haven't found a man who can draw a  blaster fast enough to call me that. You see, Pop came over in the  eighties\u2014the big wave of immigrants when they evacuated Ontario. Named  all us boys after Canadian provinces. I was the youngest, so I got the  name they were saving for a girl.\"\n\n\n \"You had a lot of brothers, Mr. Butt?\"\n\n\n He grinned with a mighty set of teeth. \"Oh, a nestful. Of course, they  were all killed in the Blue Chicago Rising by the MacGregor boys\u2014all  except me and Saskatchewan. Then Sas and me hunted the MacGregors down.  Took a heap of time; we didn't float Jock MacGregor's ugly face down  the Tuscany till both of us were pretty near grown up.\"\n\n\n I walked up close to where I could see the tiny bright copper coils of  the blaster above the firing button. \"Have you killed a lot of men with  that, Mr. Butt?\"\n\n\n \"Butt. Just plain Butt to you, Ford.\" He frowned and sighted at  the light globe. \"No more'n twelve\u2014not counting five government  paddlefeet, of course. I'm a peaceable planter. Way I figure it,  violence never accomplishes much that's important. My brother Sas,  now\u2014\" He had just begun to work into a wonderful anecdote about his brother  when the dinner gong rang. Butt told me to scat. He said I was a  growing tadpole and needed my vitamins. And he mentioned, very  off-hand, that he wouldn't at all object if I brought him some fresh  fruit. It seemed there was nothing but processed foods in the lifeboat  and Butt was used to a farmer's diet.\n\n\n Trouble was, he was a special kind of farmer. Ordinary fruit would have  been pretty easy to sneak into my pockets at meals. I even found a way  to handle the kelp and giant watercress Mr. Brown liked, but things  like seaweed salt and Venusian mud-grapes just had too strong a smell.  Twice, the mechanical hamper refused to accept my jacket for laundering  and I had to wash it myself. But I learned so many wonderful things  about Venus every time I visited that stowaway....\n\n\n I learned three wild-wave songs of the Flatfolk and what it is that the  native Venusians hate so much; I learned how you tell the difference  between a lousy government paddlefoot from New Kalamazoo and the  slaptoe slinker who is the planter's friend. After a lot of begging,  Butt Lee Brown explained the workings of his blaster, explained it  so carefully that I could name every part and tell what it did from  the tiny round electrodes to the long spirals of transformer. But no  matter what, he would never let me hold it.\n\n\n \"Sorry, Ford, old tad,\" he would drawl, spinning around and around in  the control swivel-chair at the nose of the lifeboat. \"But way I look  at it, a man who lets somebody else handle his blaster is like the  giant whose heart was in an egg that an enemy found. When you've grown  enough so's your pop feels you ought to have a weapon, why, then's the  time to learn it and you might's well learn fast. Before then, you're  plain too young to be even near it.\"\n\n\n \"I don't have a father to give me one when I come of age. I don't even  have an older brother as head of my family like your brother Labrador.  All I have is Sis. And she \u2014\"\n\n\n \"She'll marry some fancy dryhorn who's never been farther South than  the Polar Coast. And she'll stay head of the family, if I know her  breed of green shata. Bossy, opinionated. By the way, Fordie,\" he  said, rising and stretching so the fish-leather bounced and rippled off  his biceps, \"that sister. She ever....\"\n\n\n And he'd be off again, cross-examining me about Evelyn. I sat in the  swivel chair he'd vacated and tried to answer his questions. But there  was a lot of stuff I didn't know. Evelyn was a healthy girl, for  instance; how healthy, exactly, I had no way of finding out. Yes, I'd  tell him, my aunts on both sides of my family each had had more than  the average number of children. No, we'd never done any farming to  speak of, back in Undersea, but\u2014yes, I'd guess Evelyn knew about as  much as any girl there when it came to diving equipment and pressure  pump regulation.\n\n\n How would I know that stuff would lead to trouble for me? Sis had insisted I come along to the geography lecture. Most of the  other girls who were going to Venus for husbands talked to each other  during the lecture, but not my sister! She hung on every word, took  notes even, and asked enough questions to make the perspiring purser  really work in those orientation periods.\n\n\n \"I am very sorry, Miss Sparling,\" he said with pretty heavy sarcasm,  \"but I cannot remember any of the agricultural products of the Macro  Continent. Since the human population is well below one per thousand  square miles, it can readily be understood that the quantity of  tilled soil, land or sub-surface, is so small that\u2014Wait, I remember  something. The Macro Continent exports a fruit though not exactly an  edible one. The wild dunging drug is harvested there by criminal  speculators. Contrary to belief on Earth, the traffic has been growing  in recent years. In fact\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Pardon me, sir,\" I broke in, \"but doesn't dunging come only from  Leif Erickson Island off the Moscow Peninsula of the Macro Continent?  You remember, purser\u2014Wang Li's third exploration, where he proved the  island and the peninsula didn't meet for most of the year?\"\n\n\n The purser nodded slowly. \"I forgot,\" he admitted. \"Sorry, ladies, but  the boy's right. Please make the correction in your notes.\"\n\n\n But Sis was the only one who took notes, and she didn't take that one.  She stared at me for a moment, biting her lower lip thoughtfully, while  I got sicker and sicker. Then she shut her pad with the final gesture  of the right hand that Mom used to use just before challenging the  opposition to come right down on the Council floor and debate it out  with her.\n\n\n \"Ferdinand,\" Sis said, \"let's go back to our cabin.\"\n\n\n The moment she sat me down and walked slowly around me, I knew I was  in for it. \"I've been reading up on Venusian geography in the ship's  library,\" I told her in a hurry.\n\n\n \"No doubt,\" she said drily. She shook her night-black hair out. \"But  you aren't going to tell me that you read about dunging in the ship's  library. The books there have been censored by a government agent of  Earth against the possibility that they might be read by susceptible  young male minds like yours. She would not have allowed\u2014this Terran  Agent\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Paddlefoot,\" I sneered.\n\n\n Sis sat down hard in our zoom-air chair. \"Now that's a term,\" she said  carefully, \"that is used only by Venusian riffraff.\"\n\n\n \"They're not!\"\n\n\n \"Not what?\"\n\n\n \"Riffraff,\" I had to answer, knowing I was getting in deeper all the  time and not being able to help it. I mustn't give Mr. Brown away!  \"They're trappers and farmers, pioneers and explorers, who're building  Venus. And it takes a real man to build on a hot, hungry hell like  Venus.\"\n\n\n \"Does it, now?\" she said, looking at me as if I were beginning to grow  a second pair of ears. \"Tell me more.\"\n\n\n \"You can't have meek, law-abiding, women-ruled men when you start  civilization on a new planet. You've got to have men who aren't afraid  to make their own law if necessary\u2014with their own guns. That's where  law begins; the books get written up later.\"\n\n\n \"You're going to tell , Ferdinand, what evil, criminal male is  speaking through your mouth!\"\n\n\n \"Nobody!\" I insisted. \"They're my own ideas!\"\n\n\n \"They are remarkably well-organized for a young boy's ideas. A boy  who, I might add, has previously shown a ridiculous but nonetheless  entirely masculine boredom with political philosophy. I plan to have a  government career on that new planet you talk about, Ferdinand\u2014after  I have found a good, steady husband, of course\u2014and I don't look  forward to a masculinist radical in the family. Now, who has been  filling your head with all this nonsense?\" I was sweating. Sis has that deadly bulldog approach when she feels  someone is lying. I pulled my pulpast handkerchief from my pocket to  wipe my face. Something rattled to the floor.\n\n\n \"What is this picture of me doing in your pocket, Ferdinand?\"\n\n\n A trap seemed to be hinging noisily into place. \"One of the passengers  wanted to see how you looked in a bathing suit.\"\n\n\n \"The passengers on this ship are all female. I can't imagine any of  them that curious about my appearance. Ferdinand, it's a man who has  been giving you these anti-social ideas, isn't it? A war-mongering  masculinist like all the frustrated men who want to engage in  government and don't have the vaguest idea how to. Except, of course,  in their ancient, bloody ways. Ferdinand, who has been perverting that  sunny and carefree soul of yours?\"\n\n\n \"Nobody! Nobody! \"\n\n\n \"Ferdinand, there's no point in lying! I demand\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I told you, Sis. I told you! And don't call me Ferdinand. Call me  Ford.\"\n\n\n \"Ford? Ford? Now, you listen to me, Ferdinand....\"\n\n\n After that it was all over but the confession. That came in a few  moments. I couldn't fool Sis. She just knew me too well, I decided  miserably. Besides, she was a girl.\n\n\n All the same, I wouldn't get Mr. Butt Lee Brown into trouble if I could  help it. I made Sis promise she wouldn't turn him in if I took her to  him. And the quick, nodding way she said she would made me feel just a  little better.\n\n\n The door opened on the signal, \"Sesame.\" When Butt saw somebody was  with me, he jumped and the ten-inch blaster barrel grew out of his  fingers. Then he recognized Sis from the pictures.\n\n\n He stepped to one side and, with the same sweeping gesture, holstered  his blaster and pushed his green hood off. It was Sis's turn to jump  when she saw the wild mass of hair rolling down his back.\n\n\n \"An honor, Miss Sparling,\" he said in that rumbly voice. \"Please come  right in. There's a hurry-up draft.\"\n\n\n So Sis went in and I followed right after her. Mr. Brown closed the  door. I tried to catch his eye so I could give him some kind of hint or  explanation, but he had taken a couple of his big strides and was in  the control section with Sis. She didn't give ground, though; I'll say  that for her. She only came to his chest, but she had her arms crossed  sternly.\n\n\n \"First, Mr. Brown,\" she began, like talking to a cluck of a kid in  class, \"you realize that you are not only committing the political  crime of traveling without a visa, and the criminal one of stowing away  without paying your fare, but the moral delinquency of consuming stores  intended for the personnel of this ship solely in emergency?\" He opened his mouth to its maximum width and raised an enormous hand.  Then he let the air out and dropped his arm.\n\n\n \"I take it you either have no defense or care to make none,\" Sis added  caustically.\n\n\n Butt laughed slowly and carefully as if he were going over each word.  \"Wonder if all the anura talk like that. And you want to foul up  Venus.\"\n\n\n \"We haven't done so badly on Earth, after the mess you men made of  politics. It needed a revolution of the mothers before\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Needed nothing. Everyone wanted peace. Earth is a weary old world.\"\n\n\n \"It's a world of strong moral fiber compared to yours, Mr. Alberta Lee  Brown.\" Hearing his rightful name made him move suddenly and tower over  her. Sis said with a certain amount of hurry and change of tone, \"What do you have to say about stowing away and using up lifeboat stores?\" He cocked his head and considered a moment. \"Look,\" he said finally,  \"I have more than enough munit to pay for round trip tickets, but I  couldn't get a return visa because of that brinosaur judge and all  the charges she hung on me. Had to stow away. Picked the Eleanor  Roosevelt because a couple of the boys in the crew are friends of mine  and they were willing to help. But this lifeboat\u2014don't you know that  every passenger ship carries four times as many lifeboats as it needs?  Not to mention the food I didn't eat because it stuck in my throat?\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" she said bitterly. \"You had this boy steal fresh fruit for you.  I suppose you didn't know that under space regulations that makes him  equally guilty?\"\n\n\n \"No, Sis, he didn't,\" I was beginning to argue. \"All he wanted\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sure I knew. Also know that if I'm picked up as a stowaway, I'll be  sent back to Earth to serve out those fancy little sentences.\"\n\n\n \"Well, you're guilty of them, aren't you?\"\n\n\n He waved his hands at her impatiently. \"I'm not talking law, female;  I'm talking sense. Listen! I'm in trouble because I went to Earth to  look for a wife. You're standing here right now because you're on your  way to Venus for a husband. So let's.\"\n\n\n Sis actually staggered back. \"Let's? Let's what ? Are\u2014are you daring  to suggest that\u2014that\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Now, Miss Sparling, no hoopla. I'm saying let's get married, and you  know it. You figured out from what the boy told you that I was chewing  on you for a wife. You're healthy and strong, got good heredity, you  know how to operate sub-surface machinery, you've lived underwater, and  your disposition's no worse than most of the anura I've seen. Prolific  stock, too.\"\n\n\n I was so excited I just had to yell: \"Gee, Sis, say yes !\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy did people live under the water?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"The land was no longer safe\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"It was easier to mine there\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"It was easier to mine there\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cIt Was Easier to Mine There\u201d\n\n1. Primary Motive: Resource Extraction  \n  a. <quote>, when  the mineral resources of the land began to give out and engineers  figured that a lot could still be reached from the sea bottoms. </quote> (Background)  \n     \u2013 This statement explicitly identifies depletion of terrestrial minerals as the trigger for constructing Undersea. Mining underwater was the intended, not incidental, purpose.  \n  b. Continued undersea habitation despite \u201cMaternal Revolution\u201d and women\u2019s political ascendancy indicates strong economic incentives that outweigh mere \u201csafety.\u201d  \n\n2. Infrastructure and Technology Oriented Toward Mining  \n  a. Protective domes, pressure pumps, diving suits, and \u201cgravitational\u201d ships are described as subservient to \u201csea-bottom mining cities\u201d rather than general refugee shelters.  \n  b. The narrator\u2019s admiration for \u201cpressure pump regulation\u201d and \u201cdiving equipment\u201d (Background) underscores training and lifestyle centered on resource extraction.  \n\n3. Population Distribution on Earth vs. Undersea  \n  a. If \u201cland was unsafe,\u201d one would expect all genders to seek refuge underwater. Yet only men and \u201cdependent male members\u201d emigrate, while \u201cwomen really like and appreciate\u201d compliant males on Earth (Background).  \n  b. Undersea is male\u2010dominated mining labor; women remain on Earth to manage government and reproduction where mineral resources can be gathered from land until exhausted.  \n\n4. Planetary Colonization as Extension of Mining Imperative  \n  a. Leprechaun\u2010like drift to Venus and Mars (\u201cBest men went to the planets\u201d) is likewise driven by raw materials and agricultural prospects, not only safety.  \n  b. The hero\u2019s envy of the Mars\u2010bound liner and his desire to transfer from sea\u2010bed mining to planetary \u201cpioneering\u201d (Background) parallels the drive for resource acquisition, not merely escape.  \n\nRefutation of \u201cLand Was No Longer Safe\u201d  \n1. Lack of Direct Danger on Surface  \n  a. The background provides no evidence of immediate threat forcing women to abandon land; instead, women remain to maintain government and society.  \n  b. The \u201cThird Atomic War\u201d and \u201cMaternal Revolution\u201d occurred generations earlier; residual radiological or biological hazard would have subsided or would repel all, not just males.  \n2. Selective Migration Contradicts Universal Flight  \n  a. Debater_A\u2019s theory would require entire families to migrate if land safety were paramount. In contrast, only \u201cdependent\u201d males are allowed to apply for interplanetary passports; women administer Earth.  \n3. Political and Social Incentives  \n  a. The Male Desuffrage Act and exclusion of men from citizenship suggests social engineering, not environmental necessity. Undersea offers men an economic niche, reinforcing mining motive.  \n\nConclusion  \nEvery piece of evidence\u2014from the initial expedient of tapping \u201csea bottoms\u201d to the gender\u2010specific immigration policy\u2014points to undersea living as an economically driven mining venture. The \u201cdanger\u201d on land is a red herring: women remain on Earth in positions of power, only men venture beneath. Thus, \u201cIt was easier to mine there\u201d is the definitive explanation.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cThe land was no longer safe\u201d (Debater_A) 1. Core Claim: Humanity retreated Undersea because Earth\u2019s surface had become hostile and resource-scarce due to wars, radioactivity, and environmental collapse.  All evidence shows Undersea is a refuge, not a resource-hunting outpost. A. \u201cWhen the mineral resources of the land began to give out\u2026sea-bottom mining cities\u2026bubbling under protective domes\u201d (background).  \n   \u2022 Quote: <quote> when  the mineral resources of the land began to give out and engineers  figured that a lot could still be reached from the sea bottoms.</quote>  \n   \u2022 Logic: No one establishes an entire civilization in hostile, difficult Undersea purely for convenience if land were preferable. They go only when \u201cland\u2026gave out.\u201d  \nB. Atomic and social danger drove the \u201cMaternal Revolution.\u201d  \n   \u2022 \u201cAfter the Third Atomic War\u2026 Maternal Revolution\u201d (background).  \n   \u2022 Quote: <quote>had been one of the framers of the Male Desuffrage Act after the Third Atomic War</quote>  \n   \u2022 Logic: Widespread fear of radiation and war on surface compelled a safe alternative. Undersea domes control atmosphere and radiation.  \nC. Undersea settlers still \u201csurface\u201d only under protective dome boats and regard it as emergency.  \n   \u2022 \u201cMom and Pop were blown up in a surfacing boat\u201d\u2014a fatal risk.  \n   \u2022 Quote: <quote> when I got to the time Mom and Pop were blown  up in a surfacing boat.\n</quote>  \n   \u2022 Logic: Surface travel remains so dangerous that survivors rebuild Undersea despite risk and isolation. Mining convenience cannot outweigh fatal exposure.  \nD. Undersea upbringing is considered inferior by \u201creal men\u201d only because they seek conquest, not mining. The Venus-bound migrants include women seeking husbands, not resource experts.  \n   \u2022 Migration to Venus is \u201cfor husbands,\u201d not to fish resources.  \n   \u2022 Quote: <quote>pretty girls like her wouldn't be on their way to Venus to hook husbands.</quote>  \n   \u2022 Logic: If mining were the attraction, predominantly male crews and mining experts would travel, not \u201c300 females.\u201d The \u201c300 females\u201d are looking for mates, evidence the push is demographic, not resource-exploit.  \n\n2. Critique of \u201ceasier to mine\u201d position (Debater_B) A. Ignores explicit \u201cgave out\u201d language  \n   \u2022 Cannot reconcile \u201cgave out\u201d with \u201ceasier to mine.\u201d If resources remained easy, settlers would not abandon land systems. B. Overlooks war and radioactivity  \n   \u2022 Mining requires stability, yet surface sees \u201cThird Atomic War,\u201d radiation, martial law. It is irrational to mine during active conflict. C. Undersea cities lack \u201cfeel of great empty space\u201d and portholes\u2014tunnels don\u2019t mimic mining requirements.  \n   \u2022 Quote: <quote>no portholes, no visiplates,</quote>  \n   \u2022 Logic: Mining installations need light and access; Undersea ships and domes deliberately minimize exposure, evidencing a priority on safety, not resource transit. D. Resource retrieval continues via Venus import. Undersea people still hope to emigrate to planets.  \n   \u2022 If mining alone attracted them Undersea, why then risk Venus? They seek \u201cwives,\u201d not resource outposts.  \n\n3. Reinforce Safety Motive with Continual Isolation A. Even after \u201cmineral resources\u2026gave out,\u201d settlers haven\u2019t returned to surface. They remain domed.  \n   \u2022 \u201cProtective domes\u2026sea bottoms\u201d sustain generations. B. Venus migration underlines flight from Earth rather than pursuit of mining.  \n   \u2022 Travel to Venus is shown as dangerous stowaway missions to find mates, not mineral claims.  \n\nConclusion: All direct statements and behavior demonstrate Undersea\u2019s sole appeal is refuge from a hostile, resource-depleted, radioactive surface. \u201cEasier to mine\u201d fails to explain the perpetual isolation, female-led Venus migration for husbands, and the catastrophic death of surface travelers. \u201cLand was no longer safe\u201d is the only answer consistent with the text.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"It was easier to mine there\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Reinforcing \u201cLand No Longer Safe\u201d Interpretation  \n1. \u201cSea\u2010Bottom Mining Cities\u201d Only After \u201cLand\u2026Gave Out\u201d  \n  \u2022 Quote: <quote>when  the mineral resources of the land began to give out and engineers  figured that a lot could still be reached from the sea bottoms</quote>  \n  \u2013 Logic: Engineers turn to sea only when land is exhausted. A purely \u201ceconomic\u201d venture would develop surface mines first; they would not build a harder, high\u2010pressure habitat until forced.  \n2. Persistent Isolation Undersea Despite Advances  \n  \u2022 Quote: <quote>Mom and Pop were blown up in a surfacing boat</quote>  \n  \u2013 Logic: Even with \u201cdomestic\u201d craft, surface travel kills experienced settlers, yet they persist below. If surface were \u201csafe\u201d once radiation decayed, they would risk return rather than keep reinforcing costly domed infrastructure.  \n3. Undersea as \u201cDependent\u201d Male Quota, Not Skilled Pioneers  \n  \u2022 Quote: <invalid_quote>\u2018Miss Evelyn Sparling and all dependent male members\u2026\u2019\u2026\u2018This clause\u2026\u2019</invalid_quote>  \n  \u2013 Logic: The fact that only \u201cdependent males\u201d get interplanetary passports (\u201cRegistered quota\u201d) shows undersea men lack citizenship and agency. True mining specialists (\u201cbest men\u201d) are already on planets (including Venus); undersea hosts only \u201ctadpoles\u201d too weak or untrusted to hold surface passports. They are refugees, not experts.  \n4. Venus Migration by \u201cPretty Girls\u201d for Husbands  \n  \u2022 Quote: <quote>pretty girls like her wouldn't be on their way to Venus to hook husbands</quote>  \n  \u2013 Logic: If underwater were lucrative, women skilled at \u201cdunging\u201d drug export and farming would remain to manage rising economy. Instead, women embark on dangerous, sign\u2010restricted voyages to find mates on planets, showing fleeing over reproduction, not seeking new mining sites.  \n\nII. Critique of \u201cEasier to Mine\u201d Position  \n1. Selective Gender Migration Contradicts Universal Economic Flight  \n  \u2013 Debater_B argues only men mine below, women remain on Earth for government. But if mining were the goal, women versed in \u201cpressure pump regulation\u201d and sub\u2010surface tech (<quote>to diving equipment and pressure pump regulation.</quote>) would build on favorable offshore sites rather than waiting for novelty planets. Instead, they stay in \u201cMaternal World,\u201d enforcing male desuffrage, underscoring that surface is controlled, and departure is penalized.  \n2. Lack of Mining Implements and Expertise Among Stowaways  \n  \u2022 Hero carries only a blaster and begs for fruit; no mention of drills, dredges, sample containers.  \n  \u2013 Logic: A stowaway miner would be expected to transport or request specialized mining tools or samples, not learn Venusian tribal songs. His sole ambition is to \u201cget a wife.\u201d  \n3. \u201cBest Men Went to the Planets\u201d Leaves Undersea Mined Out  \n  \u2022 Quote: <quote>best men went to the planets</quote>  \n  \u2013 Logic: If planets were the economic frontier, undersea is merely a temporary stopover for the \u201cworst\u201d survivors. Undersea\u2019s continued existence is because surface Earth remains too radioactive or contested even after \u201cThird Atomic War.\u201d  \n4. \u201cNo Portholes, No Visiplates\u201d Emphasis on Protection, Not Access  \n  \u2022 Quote: <quote>only pictures. Nothing that gave the feel of great empty space</quote>  \n  \u2013 Logic: A mining operation would encourage visual checks or external observation; instead, Undersea deliberately blocks views of the surface, indicating deliberate avoidance of a hostile environment.  \n\nIII. Addressing \u201cResidual Radiological Hazard\u201d Objection  \n1. Long\u2010term Persistence of Maternal Government and Domes  \n  \u2013 \u201cMaternal Revolution\u201d persists generations after war; if surface were safe, the politically powerful majority (women) would exploit \u201cvacant\u201d land to expand population rather than enforce male desuffrage and force men to submerge.  \n2. Deadly Surface Travel Continues Despite Advances  \n  \u2013 Even routine \u201csurfacing\u201d uses \u201cemergency\u201d lifeboats and party \u201cblown up\u201d accidents. No mainstream travel resumes via portholes or visiplates.  \n\nIV. Why Only \u201c300 Females\u201d Embark to Venus  \n1. Extreme Gender Imbalance on Planets  \n  \u2013 Quote: <quote>no more than three women out of every four on Earth can expect to find husbands</quote>  \n  \u2013 Logic: Women must seek husbands off\u2010world due to male scarcity. Men are confined Undersea or planet\u2010side governments, so women travel into danger to restore demographic balance, evidence that undersea and Earth governments are not \u201cmining\u201d but sociopolitical refuges.  \n2. Venus as Alternative \u201cSafe\u201d Environment with Suitability for Reproduction  \n  \u2013 Despite \u201cwet\u201d Venus surface dangers and hostile natives (\u201cFlatfolk\u201d), pioneers (mostly male planters) tolerate risk for colony building. Women follow only for husbands, not for economic opportunity, underscoring that safety and community matters more than mining.  \n\nV. Conclusion  \nOnly \u201cland no longer safe\u201d explains:  \n  \u2022 Reluctance to view or return to surface (<quote>no portholes</quote>), fatal surfacing incidents, perpetual female\u2010led despotic \u201cMaternal Revolution,\u201d and desperate Venus migrations for mates.  \n\u201cEasier to mine\u201d fails to account for selective male displacement, lack of mining tools among refugees, and women\u2019s departure as a demographic necessity, not economic expansion.  \nTherefore, the sole coherent motive for Undersea habitation is refuge from a hostile, resource\u2010exhausted Earth surface.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cIt Was Easier to Mine There\u201d\n\n1. Text-Identified Mining Imperative  \n  a. <quote> when  the mineral resources of the land began to give out and engineers  figured that a lot could still be reached from the sea bottoms. </quote> \u2013 Undersea is conceived explicitly for resource extraction, not as a refugee camp. If safety alone were the impetus, a limited surface\u2010only settlement would suffice. Instead, \u201csea-bottom mining cities\u201d are built \u201cbubbling under protective domes,\u201d signifying long\u2010term extraction plans.  \n  b. Undersea technology (pressure pumps, diving suits, protective domes) is optimized for mining. The narrator reveres \u201cpressure pump regulation\u201d and wishes to \u201cget into\u201d diving suits; he never expresses yearning to live on land post\u2010depletion, indicating continued undersea occupation for its resource advantages.\n\n2. Gender\u2010Selective Migration Undermines \u201cSafety\u201d Theory  \n  a. Only \u201cdependent male members\u201d emigrate <quote>Evelyn Sparling and all dependent male members of family, this number not to exceed the registered</quote>. If land were truly uninhabitable, women and children would also relocate. Instead, women remain on Earth to \u201ctake an active interest in world affairs.\u201d This implies that terrestrial safety is acceptable for non\u2010labor dependents.  \n  b. Undersea is male\u2010dominated because mining is labor\u2010intensive, not because \u201creal men\u201d seek adventure. Women on Earth maintain government and social order until planetary resources are tapped, a pattern consistent with resource prioritization.\n\n3. Persistence of Undersea Despite Surface \u201cRisks\u201d Points to Economic Motive  \n  a. \u201cMom and Pop were blown up in a surfacing boat,\u201d yet settlements \u201cbubbling under domes\u201d persist generation after generation. If temporary refuge were needed, colonists would risk return when technology permits. Instead, they perpetuate isolation underwater, extracting remaining minerals.  \n  b. Men then risk space travel to new worlds when undersea resources also dwindle; this parallels the initial shift from land to sea for mining. The same \u201cbest men\u201d migrate to Venus for \u201cpioneering\u201d <quote>best men went to the planets,</quote>, reflecting ongoing resource\u2010driven expansion.\n\nRefutation of \u201cLand Was No Longer Safe\u201d\n\n1. Absence of Universal Flight  \n  \u2022 If radiation and war made the surface uninhabitable, \u201cwomen really like and appreciate\u201d male expertise would also abandon Earth. Yet women only send for husbands and maintain Earth governance, implying surface habitability except for labor.  \n2. Surface Danger Is Mitigated by Technology, Not Permanent Exile  \n  \u2022 Protective domes and lifeboats facilitate controlled surfacing for Undersea settlers. Mining requires venturing into the \u201chostile\u201d environment, yet they habitually \u201csurface,\u201d reinforcing that danger is a challenge accepted for valuable minerals.  \n3. Venus Migration Driven by Demographic/Resource Need, Not Refuge  \n  \u2022 Venus pioneers include both genders but focus on establishing agriculture and mining: the purser lectures on \u201cagricultural products\u201d and \u201cwild dunging drug\u201d exploitation <quote> exports a fruit though not exactly an  edible one.</quote>. Migration for \u201chusbands\u201d is a secondary social necessity, not the primary economic goal.\n\nConclusion  \nAll evidence points to a civilization structured around extracting dwindling terrestrial and subsea resources, with undersea living and interplanetary expansion following resource depletion patterns. The selective, labor\u2010centric migration and persistence of hazardous surfacing activity underscore that undersea and planetary settlements are founded on mining imperatives, not mere safety.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
