But that was nothing compared   to the trouble he would be in if he did not get into trouble! The visiphone chimed when Peri had just gotten into her dinner gown.  She peeled it off again and slipped on a casual bathrobe: a wisp of  translucence which had set the president of Antarctic Enterprise\u2014or  had it been the chairman of the board?\u2014back several thousand dollars.  Then she pulled a lock of lion-colored hair down over one eye, checked  with a mirror, rumpled it a tiny bit more and wrapped the robe loosely  on top and tight around the hips.\n\n\n After all, some of the men who knew her private number were important.\n\n\n She undulated to the phone and pressed its Accept. \"Hello-o, there,\"  she said automatically. \"So sorry to keep you waiting. I was just  taking a bath and\u2014Oh. It's you.\"\n\n\n Gus Doran's prawnlike eyes popped at her. \"Holy Success,\" he whispered  in awe. \"You sure the wires can carry that much voltage?\" \"Well, hurry up with whatever it is,\" snapped Peri. \"I got a date  tonight.\"\n\n\n \"I'll say you do! With a Martian!\" Peri narrowed her silver-blue gaze and looked icily at him. \"You must  have heard wrong, Gus. He's the heir apparent of Indonesia, Inc.,  that's who, and if you called up to ask for a piece of him, you can  just blank right out again. I saw him first!\"\n\n\n Doran's thin sharp face grinned. \"You break that date, Peri. Put it off  or something. I got this Martian for you, see?\"\n\n\n \"So? Since when has all Mars had as much spending money as one big-time  marijuana rancher? Not to mention the heir ap\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sure, sure. But how much are those boys going to spend on any girl,  even a high-level type like you? Listen, I need you just for tonight,  see? This Martian is strictly from gone. He is here on official  business, but he is a yokel and I do mean hayseed. Like he asked me  what the Christmas decorations in all the stores were! And here is the  solar nexus of it, Peri, kid.\"\n\n\n Doran leaned forward as if to climb out of the screen. \"He has got a  hundred million dollars expense money, and they are not going to audit  his accounts at home. One hundred million good green certificates,  legal tender anywhere in the United Protectorates. And he has about  as much backbone as a piece of steak alga. Kid, if I did not happen to  have experience otherwise with a small nephew, I would say this will be  like taking candy from a baby.\"\n\n\n Peri's peaches-and-cream countenance began to resemble peaches and  cream left overnight on Pluto. \"Badger?\" she asked.\n\n\n \"Sure. You and Sam Wendt handle the routine. I will take the go-between  angle, so he will think of me as still his friend, because I have other  plans for him too. But if we can't shake a million out of him for this  one night's work, there is something akilter. And your share of a  million is three hundred thirty-three\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Is five hundred thousand flat,\" said Peri. \"Too bad I just got an  awful headache and can't see Mr. Sastro tonight. Where you at, Gus?\" The gravity was not as hard to take as Peter Matheny had expected.  Three generations on Mars might lengthen the legs and expand the chest  a trifle, but the genes had come from Earth and the organism readjusts.  What set him gasping was the air. It weighed like a ton of wool and had  apparently sopped up half the Atlantic Ocean. Ears trained to listen  through the Martian atmosphere shuddered from the racket conducted by  Earth's. The passport official seemed to bellow at him.\n\n\n \"Pardon me for asking this. The United Protectorates welcome all  visitors to Earth and I assure you, sir, an ordinary five-year visa  provokes no questions. But since you came on an official courier boat  of your planet, Mr. Matheny, regulations force me to ask your business.\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014recruiting.\"\n\n\n The official patted his comfortable stomach, iridescent in neolon, and  chuckled patronizingly. \"I am afraid, sir, you won't find many people  who wish to leave. They wouldn't be able to see the Teamsters Hour on  Mars, would they?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, we don't expect immigration,\" said Matheny shyly. He was a fairly  young man, but small, with a dark-thatched, snub-nosed, gray-eyed  head that seemed too large for his slender body. \"We learned long ago  that no one is interested any more in giving up even second-class  citizenship on Earth to live in the Republic. But we only wanted to  hire\u2014\u2014uh, I mean engage\u2014an, an advisor. We're not businessmen. We  know our export trade hasn't a chance among all your corporations  unless we get some\u2014a five-year contract...?\"\n\n\n He heard his words trailing off idiotically, and swore at himself.\n\n\n \"Well, good luck.\" The official's tone was skeptical. He stamped the  passport and handed it back. \"There, now, you are free to travel  anywhere in the Protectorates. But I would advise you to leave the  capital and get into the sticks\u2014um, I mean the provinces. I am sure  there must be tolerably competent sales executives in Russia or  Congolese Belgium or such regions. Frankly, sir, I do not believe you  can attract anyone out of Newer York.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks,\" said Matheny, \"but, you see, I\u2014we need\u2014that is.... Oh,  well. Thanks. Good-by.\"\n\n\n He backed out of the office. A dropshaft deposited him on a walkway. The crowd, a rainbow of men in  pajamas and robes, women in Neo-Sino dresses and goldleaf hats, swept  him against the rail. For a moment, squashed to the wire, he stared a  hundred feet down at the river of automobiles. Phobos! he thought  wildly. If the barrier gives, I'll be sliced in two by a dorsal fin  before I hit the pavement! The August twilight wrapped him in heat and stickiness. He could see  neither stars nor even moon through the city's blaze. The forest of  multi-colored towers, cataracting half a mile skyward across more  acreage than his eyes reached, was impressive and all that, but\u2014he  used to stroll out in the rock garden behind his cottage and smoke a  pipe in company with Orion. On summer evenings, that is, when the  temperature wasn't too far below zero. Why did they tap me for this job? he asked himself in a surge of  homesickness. What the hell is the Martian Embassy here for? He, Peter Matheny, was no more than a peaceful professor of  sociodynamics at Devil's Kettle University. Of course, he had advised  his government before now\u2014in fact, the Red Ankh Society had been his  idea\u2014but still he was at ease only with his books and his chess and  his mineral collection, a faculty poker party on Tenthday night and an  occasional trip to Swindletown\u2014 My God , thought Matheny, here I am, one solitary outlander in the  greatest commercial empire the human race has ever seen, and I'm  supposed to find my planet a con man! He began walking, disconsolately, at random. His lizardskin shirt and  black culottes drew glances, but derisive ones: their cut was forty  years out of date. He should find himself a hotel, he thought drearily,  but he wasn't tired; the spaceport would pneumo his baggage to him  whenever he did check in. The few Martians who had been to Earth had  gone into ecstasies over the automation which put any service you could  name on a twenty-four-hour basis. But it would be a long time before  Mars had such machines. If ever.\n\n\n The city roared at him.\n\n\n He fumbled after his pipe. Of course , he told himself, that's why  the Embassy can't act. I may find it advisable to go outside the law.  Please, sir, where can I contact the underworld? He wished gambling were legal on Earth. The Constitution of the Martian  Republic forbade sumptuary and moral legislation; quite apart from the  rambunctious individualism which that document formulated, the article  was a practical necessity. Life was bleak enough on the deserts,  without being denied the pleasure of trying to bottom-deal some friend  who was happily trying to mark the cards. Matheny would have found a  few spins of roulette soothing: it was always an intellectual challenge  to work out the system by which the management operated a wheel. But  more, he would have been among people he understood.\n\n\n The frightful thing about the Earthman was the way he seemed to  exist only in organized masses. A gypsy snake oil peddler, plodding  his syrtosaur wagon across Martian sands, just didn't have a prayer  against, say, the Grant, Harding &amp; Adams Public Relations Agency. Matheny puffed smoke and looked around. His feet ached from the weight  on them. Where could a man sit down? It was hard to make out any  individual sign through all that flimmering neon. His eye fell on one  that was distinguished by relative austerity. THE CHURCH OF CHOICE Enter, Play, Pray That would do. He took an upward slideramp through several hundred feet  of altitude, stepped past an aurora curtain, and found himself in a  marble lobby next to an inspirational newsstand.\n\n\n \"Ah, brother, welcome,\" said a red-haired usherette in demure black  leotards. \"The peace that passeth all understanding be with you. The  restaurant is right up those stairs.\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014I'm not hungry,\" stammered Matheny. \"I just wanted to sit in\u2014\"\n\n\n \"To your left, sir.\"\n\n\n The Martian crossed the lobby. His pipe went out in the breeze from an  animated angel. Organ music sighed through an open doorway. The series  of rooms beyond was dim, Gothic, interminable.\n\n\n \"Get your chips right here, sir,\" said the girl in the booth.\n\n\n \"Hm?\" said Matheny.\n\n\n She explained. He bought a few hundred-dollar tokens, dropped a  fifty-buck coin down a slot marked CONTRIBUTIONS, and sipped the  martini he got back while he strolled around studying the games.  He stopped, frowned. Bingo? No, he didn't want to bother learning  something new. He decided that the roulette wheels were either honest  or too deep for him. He'd have to relax with a crap game instead.\n\n\n He had been standing at the table for some time before the rest of the  congregation really noticed him. Then it was with awe. The first few  passes he had made were unsuccessful. Earth gravity threw him off.  But when he got the rhythm of it, he tossed a row of sevens. It was a  customary form of challenge on Mars. Here, though, they simply pushed  chips toward him. He missed a throw, as anyone would at home: simple  courtesy. The next time around, he threw for a seven just to get the  feel. He got a seven. The dice had not been substituted on him.\n\n\n \"I say!\" he exclaimed. He looked up into eyes and eyes, all around the  green table. \"I'm sorry. I guess I don't know your rules.\"\n\n\n \"You did all right, brother,\" said a middle-aged lady with an obviously  surgical bodice.\n\n\n \"But\u2014I mean\u2014when do we start actually playing ? What happened to the  cocked dice?\" The lady drew herself up and jutted an indignant brow at him. \"Sir!  This is a church!\"\n\n\n \"Oh\u2014I see\u2014excuse me, I, I, I\u2014\" Matheny backed out of the crowd,  shuddering. He looked around for some place to hide his burning ears.\n\n\n \"You forgot your chips, pal,\" said a voice.\n\n\n \"Oh. Thanks. Thanks ever so much. I, I, that is\u2014\" Matheny cursed  his knotting tongue. Damn it, just because they're so much more  sophisticated than I, do I have to talk like a leaky boiler? The helpful Earthman was not tall. He was dark and chisel-faced and  sleekly pomaded, dapper in blue pajamas with a red zigzag, a sleighbell  cloak and curly-toed slippers.\n\n\n \"You're from Mars, aren't you?\" he asked in the friendliest tone  Matheny had yet heard.\n\n\n \"Yes. Yes, I am. M-my name's Peter Matheny. I, I\u2014\" He stuck out his  hand to shake and chips rolled over the floor. \"Damn! Oh, excuse me, I  forgot this was a church. Never mind the chips. No, please. I just want  to g-g-get the hell out of here.\"\n\n\n \"Good idea. How about a drink? I know a bar downshaft.\"\n\n\n Matheny sighed. \"A drink is what I need the very most.\"\n\n\n \"My name's Doran. Gus Doran. Call me Gus.\"\n\n\n They walked back to the deaconette's booth and Matheny cashed what  remained of his winnings.\n\n\n \"I don't want to\u2014I mean if you're busy tonight, Mr. Doran\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Nah. I am not doing one thing in particular. Besides, I have never met  a Martian. I am very interested.\"\n\n\n \"There aren't many of us on Earth,\" agreed Matheny. \"Just a small  embassy staff and an occasional like me.\"\n\n\n \"I should think you would do a lot of traveling here. The old mother  planet and so on.\"\n\n\n \"We can't afford it,\" said Matheny. \"What with gravitation and  distance, such voyages are much too expensive for us to make them for  pleasure. Not to mention our dollar shortage.\" As they entered the  shaft, he added wistfully: \"You Earth people have that kind of money,  at least in your more prosperous brackets. Why don't you send a few  tourists to us?\"\n\n\n \"I always wanted to,\" said Doran. \"I would like to see the what they  call City of Time, and so on. As a matter of fact, I have given my  girl one of those Old Martian rings last Ike's Birthday and she was  just gazoo about it. A jewel dug out of the City of Time, like,  made a million years ago by a, uh, extinct race ... I tell you, she appreciated me for it!\" He winked and nudged.\n\n\n \"Oh,\" said Matheny. He felt a certain guilt. Doran was too pleasant a little man to  deserve\u2014\n\n\n \"Of course,\" Matheny said ritually, \"I agree with all the archeologists  it's a crime to sell such scientifically priceless artifacts, but what  can we do? We must live, and the tourist trade is almost nonexistent.\"\n\n\n \"Trouble with it is, I hear Mars is not so comfortable,\" said Doran. \"I  mean, do not get me wrong, I don't want to insult you or anything, but  people come back saying you have given the planet just barely enough  air to keep a man alive. And there are no cities, just little towns and  villages and ranches out in the bush. I mean you are being pioneers and  making a new nation and all that, but people paying half a megabuck for  their ticket expect some comfort and, uh, you know.\"\n\n\n \"I do know,\" said Matheny. \"But we're poor\u2014a handful of people trying  to make a world of dust and sand and scrub thorn into fields and woods  and seas. We can't do it without substantial help from Earth, equipment  and supplies\u2014which can only be paid for in Earth dollars\u2014and we can't  export enough to Earth to earn those dollars.\"\n\n\n By that time, they were entering the Paul Bunyan Knotty Pine Bar &amp;  Grill, on the 73rd Level. Matheny's jaw clanked down.\n\n\n \"Whassa matter?\" asked Doran. \"Ain't you ever seen a ecdysiastic  technician before?\"\n\n\n \"Uh, yes, but\u2014well, not in a 3-D image under ten magnifications.\"\n\n\n Matheny followed Doran past a sign announcing that this show was for  purely artistic purposes, into a booth. There a soundproof curtain  reduced the noise level enough so they could talk in normal voices.\n\n\n \"What'll you have?\" asked Doran. \"It's on me.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, I couldn't let you. I mean\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense. Welcome to Earth! Care for a thyle and vermouth?\"\n\n\n Matheny shuddered. \"Good Lord, no!\"\n\n\n \"Huh? But they make thyle right on Mars, don't they?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. And it all goes to Earth and sells at 2000 dollars a fifth. But  you don't think we'd drink it, do you? I mean\u2014well, I imagine it  doesn't absolutely ruin vermouth. But we don't see those Earthside  commercials about how sophisticated people like it so much.\" \"Well, I'll be a socialist creeper!\" Doran's face split in a grin. \"You  know, all my life I've hated the stuff and never dared admit it!\" He  raised a hand. \"Don't worry, I won't blabbo. But I am wondering, if you  control the thyle industry and sell all those relics at fancy prices,  why do you call yourselves poor?\"\n\n\n \"Because we are,\" said Matheny. \"By the time the shipping costs have  been paid on a bottle, and the Earth wholesaler and jobber and sales  engineer and so on, down to the retailer, have taken their percentage,  and the advertising agency has been paid, and about fifty separate  Earth taxes\u2014there's very little profit going back to the distillery  on Mars. The same principle is what's strangling us on everything. Old  Martian artifacts aren't really rare, for instance, but freight charges  and the middlemen here put them out of the mass market.\"\n\n\n \"Have you not got some other business?\"\n\n\n \"Well, we do sell a lot of color slides, postcards, baggage labels and  so on to people who like to act cosmopolitan, and I understand our  travel posters are quite popular as wall decoration. But all that has  to be printed on Earth, and the printer and distributor keep most of  the money. We've sold some books and show tapes, of course, but only  one has been really successful\u2014 I Was a Slave Girl on Mars .\n\n\n \"Our most prominent novelist was co-opted to ghostwrite that one.  Again, though, local income taxes took most of the money; authors  never have been protected the way a businessman is. We do make a high  percentage of profit on those little certificates you see around\u2014you  know, the title deeds to one square inch of Mars\u2014but expressed  absolutely, in dollars, it doesn't amount to much when we start  shopping for bulldozers and thermonuclear power plants.\"\n\n\n \"How about postage stamps?\" inquired Doran. \"Philately is a big  business, I have heard.\"\n\n\n \"It was our mainstay,\" admitted Matheny, \"but it's been overworked.  Martian stamps are a drug on the market. What we'd like to operate is a  sweepstakes, but the anti-gambling laws on Earth forbid that.\" Doran whistled. \"I got to give your people credit for enterprise,  anyway!\" He fingered his mustache. \"Uh, pardon me, but have you tried  to, well, attract capital from Earth?\"\n\n\n \"Of course,\" said Matheny bitterly. \"We offer the most liberal  concessions in the Solar System. Any little mining company or transport  firm or\u2014or anybody\u2014who wanted to come and actually invest a few  dollars in Mars\u2014why, we'd probably give him the President's daughter  as security. No, the Minister of Ecology has a better-looking one.  But who's interested? We haven't a thing that Earth hasn't got more  of. We're only the descendants of a few scientists, a few political  malcontents, oddballs who happen to prefer elbow room and a bill of  liberties to the incorporated state\u2014what could General Nucleonics  hope to get from Mars?\"\n\n\n \"I see. Well, what are you having to drink?\"\n\n\n \"Beer,\" said Matheny without hesitation.\n\n\n \"Huh? Look, pal, this is on me.\"\n\n\n \"The only beer on Mars comes forty million miles, with interplanetary  freight charges tacked on,\" said Matheny. \"Heineken's!\"\n\n\n Doran shrugged, dialed the dispenser and fed it coins.\n\n\n \"This is a real interesting talk, Pete,\" he said. \"You are being very  frank with me. I like a man that is frank.\"\n\n\n Matheny shrugged. \"I haven't told you anything that isn't known to  every economist.\" Of course I haven't. I've not so much as mentioned the Red Ankh, for  instance. But, in principle, I have told him the truth, told him of our  need; for even the secret operations do not yield us enough. The beer arrived. Matheny engulfed himself in it. Doran sipped at a  whiskey sour and unobtrusively set another full bottle in front of the  Martian.\n\n\n \"Ahhh!\" said Matheny. \"Bless you, my friend.\"\n\n\n \"A pleasure.\"\n\n\n \"But now you must let me buy you one.\"\n\n\n \"That is not necessary. After all,\" said Doran with great tact, \"with  the situation as you have been describing\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Oh, we're not that poor! My expense allowance assumes I will  entertain quite a bit.\"\n\n\n Doran's brows lifted a few minutes of arc. \"You're here on business,  then?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. I told you we haven't any tourists. I was sent to hire a business  manager for the Martian export trade.\"\n\n\n \"What's wrong with your own people? I mean, Pete, it is not your fault  there are so many rackets\u2014uh, taxes\u2014and middlemen and agencies and et  cetera. That is just the way Earth is set up these days.\" Matheny's finger stabbed in the general direction of Doran's pajama  top. \"Exactly. And who set it up that way? Earthmen. We Martians are  babes in the desert. What chance do we have to earn dollars on the  scale we need them, in competition with corporations which could buy  and sell our whole planet before breakfast? Why, we couldn't afford  three seconds of commercial time on a Lullaby Pillow 'cast. What we  need, what we have to hire, is an executive who knows Earth, who's an  Earthman himself. Let him tell us what will appeal to your people, and  how to dodge the tax bite and\u2014and\u2014well, you see how it goes, that  sort of, uh, thing.\"\n\n\n Matheny felt his eloquence running down and grabbed for the second  bottle of beer.\n\n\n \"But where do I start?\" he asked plaintively, for his loneliness smote  him anew. \"I'm just a college professor at home. How would I even get  to see\u2014\"\n\n\n \"It might be arranged,\" said Doran in a thoughtful tone. \"It just  might. How much could you pay this fellow?\"\n\n\n \"A hundred megabucks a year, if he'll sign a five-year contract. That's  Earth years, mind you.\"\n\n\n \"I'm sorry to tell you this, Pete,\" said Doran, \"but while that is not  bad money, it is not what a high-powered sales scientist gets in Newer  York. Plus his retirement benefits, which he would lose if he quit  where he is now at. And I am sure he would not want to settle on Mars  permanently.\"\n\n\n \"I could offer a certain amount of, uh, lagniappe,\" said Matheny. \"That  is, well, I can draw up to a hundred megabucks myself for, uh, expenses  and, well ... let me buy you a drink!\"\n\n\n Doran's black eyes frogged at him. \"You might at that,\" said the  Earthman very softly. \"Yes, you might at that.\"\n\n\n Matheny found himself warming. Gus Doran was an authentic bobber. A  hell of a swell chap. He explained modestly that he was a free-lance  business consultant and it was barely possible that he could arrange  some contacts....\n\n\n \"No, no, no commission, all done in the interest of interplanetary  friendship ... well, anyhow, let's not talk business now. If you have  got to stick to beer, Pete, make it a chaser to akvavit. What is  akvavit? Well, I will just take and show you.\"\n\n\n A hell of a good bloke. He knew some very funny stories, too, and  he laughed at Matheny's, though they were probably too rustic for a  big-city taste like his.\n\n\n \"What I really want,\" said Matheny, \"what I really want\u2014I mean what  Mars really needs, get me?\u2014is a confidence man.\"\n\n\n \"A what?\"\n\n\n \"The best and slickest one on Earth, to operate a world-size con game  for us and make us some real money.\"\n\n\n \"Con man? Oh. A slipstring.\"\n\n\n \"A con by any other name,\" said Matheny, pouring down an akvavit. Doran squinted through cigarette smoke. \"You are interesting me  strangely, my friend. Say on.\"\n\n\n \"No.\" Matheny realized his head was a bit smoky. The walls of the booth  seemed odd, somehow. They were just leatheroid walls, but they had an  odd quality.\n\n\n \"No, sorry, Gus,\" he said. \"I spoke too much.\"\n\n\n \"Okay. Forget it. I do not like a man that pries. But look, let's bomb  out of here, how about it? Go have a little fun.\"\n\n\n \"By all means.\" Matheny disposed of his last beer. \"I could use some  gaiety.\"\n\n\n \"You have come to the right town then. But let us get you a hotel room  first and some more up-to-date clothes.\"\n\n\n \" Allez ,\" said Matheny. \"If I don't mean allons , or maybe alors .\"\n\n\n The drop down to cab-ramp level and the short ride afterward sobered  him; the room rate at the Jupiter-Astoria sobered him still more. Oh, well , he thought, if I succeed in this job, no one at home will  quibble. And the chamber to which he and Doran were shown was spectacular  enough, with a pneumo direct to the bar and a full-wall transparency to  show the vertical incandescence of the towers.\n\n\n \"Whoof!\" Matheny sat down. The chair slithered sensuously about his  contours. He jumped. \"What the dusty hell\u2014Oh.\" He tried to grin, but  his face burned. \"I see.\"\n\n\n \"That is a sexy type of furniture, all right,\" agreed Doran. He lowered  himself into another chair, cocked his feet on the 3-D and waved a  cigarette. \"Which speaking of, what say we get some girls? It is not  too late to catch them at home. A date here will usually start around  2100 hours earliest.\"\n\n\n \"What?\"\n\n\n \"You know. Dames. Like a certain blonde warhead with twin radar and  swivel mounting, and she just loves exotics. Such as you.\"\n\n\n \"Me?\" Matheny heard his voice climb to a schoolboy squeak. \"Me?  Exotic? Why, I'm just a little college professor. I g-g-g, that is\u2014\"  His tongue got stuck on his palate. He pulled it loose and moistened  uncertain lips.\n\n\n \"You are from Mars. Okay? So you fought bushcats barehanded in an  abandoned canal.\"\n\n\n \"What's a bushcat? And we don't have canals. The evaporation rate\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Look, Pete,\" said Doran patiently. \"She don't have to know that, does  she?\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014well, no. I guess not No.\"\n\n\n \"Let's order you some clothes on the pneumo,\" said Doran. \"I recommend  you buy from Schwartzherz. Everybody knows he is expensive.\" While Matheny jittered about, shaving and showering and struggling with  his new raiment, Doran kept him supplied with akvavit and beer.\n\n\n \"You said one thing, Pete,\" Doran remarked. \"About needing a  slipstring. A con man, you would call it.\"\n\n\n \"Forget that. Please. I spoke out of turn.\"\n\n\n \"Well, you see, maybe a man like that is just what Mars does need. And  maybe I have got a few contacts.\"\n\n\n \"What?\" Matheny gaped out of the bathroom.\n\n\n Doran cupped his hands around a fresh cigarette, not looking at him.  \"I am not that man,\" he said frankly. \"But in my line I get a lot of  contacts, and not all of them go topside. See what I mean? Like if,  say, you wanted somebody terminated and could pay for it, I could not  do it. I would not want to know anything about it. But I could tell you  a phone number.\"\n\n\n He shrugged and gave the Martian a sidelong glance. \"Sure, you may not  be interested. But if you are, well, Pete, I was not born yesterday. I  got tolerance. Like the book says, if you want to get ahead, you have  got to think positively.\"\n\n\n Matheny hesitated. If only he hadn't taken that last shot! It made him  want to say yes, immediately, without reservations. And therefore maybe  he became overcautious.\n\n\n They had instructed him on Mars to take chances if he must.\n\n\n \"I could tell you a thing or two that might give you a better idea,\" he  said slowly. \"But it would have to be under security.\"\n\n\n \"Okay by me. Room service can send us up an oath box right now.\"\n\n\n \"What? But\u2014but\u2014\" Matheny hung onto himself and tried to believe that  he had landed on Earth less than six hours ago.\n\n\n In the end, he did call room service and the machine was trundled in.  Doran swallowed the pill and donned the conditioner helmet without an  instant's hesitation.\n\n\n \"I shall never reveal to any person unauthorized by yourself whatever  you may tell me under security, now or at any other time,\" he  recited. Then, cheerfully: \"And that formula, Pete, happens to be the  honest-to-zebra truth.\"\n\n\n \"I know.\" Matheny stared, embarrassed, at the carpet. \"I'm sorry  to\u2014to\u2014I mean of course I trust you, but\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Forget it. I take a hundred security oaths a year, in my line of work.  Maybe I can help you. I like you, Pete, damn if I don't. And, sure,  I might stand to get an agent's cut, if I arrange\u2014Go ahead, boy, go  ahead.\" Doran crossed his legs and leaned back.\n\n\n \"Oh, it's simple enough,\" said Matheny. \"It's only that we already are  operating con games.\"\n\n\n \"On Mars, you mean?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. There never were any Old Martians. We erected the ruins fifty  years ago for the Billingsworth Expedition to find. We've been  manufacturing relics ever since.\"\n\n\n \" Huh? Well, why, but\u2014\"\n\n\n \"In this case, it helps to be at the far end of an interplanetary  haul,\" said Matheny. \"Not many Terrestrial archeologists get to Mars  and they depend on our people to\u2014Well, anyhow\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I will be clopped! Good for you!\" Doran blew up in laughter. \"That is one thing I would never spill, even  without security. I told you about my girl friend, didn't I?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, and that calls to mind the Little Girl,\" said Matheny  apologetically. \"She was another official project.\"\n\n\n \"Who?\"\n\n\n \"Remember Junie O'Brien? The little golden-haired girl on Mars, a  mathematical prodigy, but dying of an incurable disease? She collected  Earth coins.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, that. Sure, I remember\u2014Hey! You didn't!\"\n\n\n \"Yes. We made about a billion dollars on that one.\"\n\n\n \"I will be double damned. You know, Pete, I sent her a hundred-buck  piece myself. Say, how is Junie O'Brien?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, fine. Under a different name, she's now our finance minister.\"  Matheny stared out the wall, his hands twisting nervously behind his  back. \"There were no lies involved. She really does have a fatal  disease. So do you and I. Every day we grow older.\"\n\n\n \"Uh!\" exclaimed Doran.\n\n\n \"And then the Red Ankh Society. You must have seen or heard their ads.  'What mysterious knowledge did the Old Martians possess? What was  the secret wisdom of the Ancient Aliens? Now the incredibly powerful  semantics of the Red Ankh (not a religious organization) is available  to a select few\u2014' That's our largest dollar-earning enterprise.\"\n\n\n He would have liked to say it was his suggestion originally, but it  would have been too presumptuous. He was talking to an Earthman, who  had heard everything already.\n\n\n Doran whistled.\n\n\n \"That's about all, so far,\" confessed Matheny. \"Perhaps a con is our  only hope. I've been wondering, maybe we could organize a Martian  bucket shop, handling Martian securities, but\u2014well, I don't know.\"\n\n\n \"I think\u2014\" Doran removed the helmet and stood up.\n\n\n \"Yes?\" Matheny faced around, shivering with his own tension.\n\n\n \"I may be able to find the man you want,\" said Doran. \"I just may. It  will take a few days and might get a little expensive.\"\n\n\n \"You mean.... Mr. Doran\u2014Gus\u2014you could actually\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I cannot promise anything yet except that I will try.

But that was nothing compared   to the trouble he would be in if he did not get into trouble! The visiphone chimed when Peri had just gotten into her dinner gown.  She peeled it off again and slipped on a casual bathrobe: a wisp of  translucence which had set the president of Antarctic Enterprise\u2014or  had it been the chairman of the board?\u2014back several thousand dollars.  Then she pulled a lock of lion-colored hair down over one eye, checked  with a mirror, rumpled it a tiny bit more and wrapped the robe loosely  on top and tight around the hips.\n\n\n After all, some of the men who knew her private number were important.\n\n\n She undulated to the phone and pressed its Accept. \"Hello-o, there,\"  she said automatically. \"So sorry to keep you waiting. I was just  taking a bath and\u2014Oh. It's you.\"\n\n\n Gus Doran's prawnlike eyes popped at her. \"Holy Success,\" he whispered  in awe. \"You sure the wires can carry that much voltage?\" \"Well, hurry up with whatever it is,\" snapped Peri. \"I got a date  tonight.\"\n\n\n \"I'll say you do! With a Martian!\" Peri narrowed her silver-blue gaze and looked icily at him. \"You must  have heard wrong, Gus. He's the heir apparent of Indonesia, Inc.,  that's who, and if you called up to ask for a piece of him, you can  just blank right out again. I saw him first!\"\n\n\n Doran's thin sharp face grinned. \"You break that date, Peri. Put it off  or something. I got this Martian for you, see?\"\n\n\n \"So? Since when has all Mars had as much spending money as one big-time  marijuana rancher? Not to mention the heir ap\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sure, sure. But how much are those boys going to spend on any girl,  even a high-level type like you? Listen, I need you just for tonight,  see? This Martian is strictly from gone. He is here on official  business, but he is a yokel and I do mean hayseed. Like he asked me  what the Christmas decorations in all the stores were! And here is the  solar nexus of it, Peri, kid.\"\n\n\n Doran leaned forward as if to climb out of the screen. \"He has got a  hundred million dollars expense money, and they are not going to audit  his accounts at home. One hundred million good green certificates,  legal tender anywhere in the United Protectorates. And he has about  as much backbone as a piece of steak alga. Kid, if I did not happen to  have experience otherwise with a small nephew, I would say this will be  like taking candy from a baby.\"\n\n\n Peri's peaches-and-cream countenance began to resemble peaches and  cream left overnight on Pluto. \"Badger?\" she asked.\n\n\n \"Sure. You and Sam Wendt handle the routine. I will take the go-between  angle, so he will think of me as still his friend, because I have other  plans for him too. But if we can't shake a million out of him for this  one night's work, there is something akilter. And your share of a  million is three hundred thirty-three\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Is five hundred thousand flat,\" said Peri. \"Too bad I just got an  awful headache and can't see Mr. Sastro tonight. Where you at, Gus?\" The gravity was not as hard to take as Peter Matheny had expected.  Three generations on Mars might lengthen the legs and expand the chest  a trifle, but the genes had come from Earth and the organism readjusts.  What set him gasping was the air. It weighed like a ton of wool and had  apparently sopped up half the Atlantic Ocean. Ears trained to listen  through the Martian atmosphere shuddered from the racket conducted by  Earth's. The passport official seemed to bellow at him.\n\n\n \"Pardon me for asking this. The United Protectorates welcome all  visitors to Earth and I assure you, sir, an ordinary five-year visa  provokes no questions. But since you came on an official courier boat  of your planet, Mr. Matheny, regulations force me to ask your business.\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014recruiting.\"\n\n\n The official patted his comfortable stomach, iridescent in neolon, and  chuckled patronizingly. \"I am afraid, sir, you won't find many people  who wish to leave. They wouldn't be able to see the Teamsters Hour on  Mars, would they?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, we don't expect immigration,\" said Matheny shyly. He was a fairly  young man, but small, with a dark-thatched, snub-nosed, gray-eyed  head that seemed too large for his slender body. \"We learned long ago  that no one is interested any more in giving up even second-class  citizenship on Earth to live in the Republic. But we only wanted to  hire\u2014\u2014uh, I mean engage\u2014an, an advisor. We're not businessmen. We  know our export trade hasn't a chance among all your corporations  unless we get some\u2014a five-year contract...?\"\n\n\n He heard his words trailing off idiotically, and swore at himself.\n\n\n \"Well, good luck.\" The official's tone was skeptical. He stamped the  passport and handed it back. \"There, now, you are free to travel  anywhere in the Protectorates. But I would advise you to leave the  capital and get into the sticks\u2014um, I mean the provinces. I am sure  there must be tolerably competent sales executives in Russia or  Congolese Belgium or such regions. Frankly, sir, I do not believe you  can attract anyone out of Newer York.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks,\" said Matheny, \"but, you see, I\u2014we need\u2014that is.... Oh,  well. Thanks. Good-by.\"\n\n\n He backed out of the office. A dropshaft deposited him on a walkway. The crowd, a rainbow of men in  pajamas and robes, women in Neo-Sino dresses and goldleaf hats, swept  him against the rail. For a moment, squashed to the wire, he stared a  hundred feet down at the river of automobiles. Phobos! he thought  wildly. If the barrier gives, I'll be sliced in two by a dorsal fin  before I hit the pavement! The August twilight wrapped him in heat and stickiness. He could see  neither stars nor even moon through the city's blaze. The forest of  multi-colored towers, cataracting half a mile skyward across more  acreage than his eyes reached, was impressive and all that, but\u2014he  used to stroll out in the rock garden behind his cottage and smoke a  pipe in company with Orion. On summer evenings, that is, when the  temperature wasn't too far below zero. Why did they tap me for this job? he asked himself in a surge of  homesickness. What the hell is the Martian Embassy here for? He, Peter Matheny, was no more than a peaceful professor of  sociodynamics at Devil's Kettle University. Of course, he had advised  his government before now\u2014in fact, the Red Ankh Society had been his  idea\u2014but still he was at ease only with his books and his chess and  his mineral collection, a faculty poker party on Tenthday night and an  occasional trip to Swindletown\u2014 My God , thought Matheny, here I am, one solitary outlander in the  greatest commercial empire the human race has ever seen, and I'm  supposed to find my planet a con man! He began walking, disconsolately, at random. His lizardskin shirt and  black culottes drew glances, but derisive ones: their cut was forty  years out of date. He should find himself a hotel, he thought drearily,  but he wasn't tired; the spaceport would pneumo his baggage to him  whenever he did check in. The few Martians who had been to Earth had  gone into ecstasies over the automation which put any service you could  name on a twenty-four-hour basis. But it would be a long time before  Mars had such machines. If ever.\n\n\n The city roared at him.\n\n\n He fumbled after his pipe. Of course , he told himself, that's why  the Embassy can't act. I may find it advisable to go outside the law.  Please, sir, where can I contact the underworld? He wished gambling were legal on Earth. The Constitution of the Martian  Republic forbade sumptuary and moral legislation; quite apart from the  rambunctious individualism which that document formulated, the article  was a practical necessity. Life was bleak enough on the deserts,  without being denied the pleasure of trying to bottom-deal some friend  who was happily trying to mark the cards. Matheny would have found a  few spins of roulette soothing: it was always an intellectual challenge  to work out the system by which the management operated a wheel. But  more, he would have been among people he understood.\n\n\n The frightful thing about the Earthman was the way he seemed to  exist only in organized masses. A gypsy snake oil peddler, plodding  his syrtosaur wagon across Martian sands, just didn't have a prayer  against, say, the Grant, Harding &amp; Adams Public Relations Agency. Matheny puffed smoke and looked around. His feet ached from the weight  on them. Where could a man sit down? It was hard to make out any  individual sign through all that flimmering neon. His eye fell on one  that was distinguished by relative austerity. THE CHURCH OF CHOICE Enter, Play, Pray That would do. He took an upward slideramp through several hundred feet  of altitude, stepped past an aurora curtain, and found himself in a  marble lobby next to an inspirational newsstand.\n\n\n \"Ah, brother, welcome,\" said a red-haired usherette in demure black  leotards. \"The peace that passeth all understanding be with you. The  restaurant is right up those stairs.\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014I'm not hungry,\" stammered Matheny. \"I just wanted to sit in\u2014\"\n\n\n \"To your left, sir.\"\n\n\n The Martian crossed the lobby. His pipe went out in the breeze from an  animated angel. Organ music sighed through an open doorway. The series  of rooms beyond was dim, Gothic, interminable.\n\n\n \"Get your chips right here, sir,\" said the girl in the booth.\n\n\n \"Hm?\" said Matheny.\n\n\n She explained. He bought a few hundred-dollar tokens, dropped a  fifty-buck coin down a slot marked CONTRIBUTIONS, and sipped the  martini he got back while he strolled around studying the games.  He stopped, frowned. Bingo? No, he didn't want to bother learning  something new. He decided that the roulette wheels were either honest  or too deep for him. He'd have to relax with a crap game instead.\n\n\n He had been standing at the table for some time before the rest of the  congregation really noticed him. Then it was with awe. The first few  passes he had made were unsuccessful. Earth gravity threw him off.  But when he got the rhythm of it, he tossed a row of sevens. It was a  customary form of challenge on Mars. Here, though, they simply pushed  chips toward him. He missed a throw, as anyone would at home: simple  courtesy. The next time around, he threw for a seven just to get the  feel. He got a seven. The dice had not been substituted on him.\n\n\n \"I say!\" he exclaimed. He looked up into eyes and eyes, all around the  green table. \"I'm sorry. I guess I don't know your rules.\"\n\n\n \"You did all right, brother,\" said a middle-aged lady with an obviously  surgical bodice.\n\n\n \"But\u2014I mean\u2014when do we start actually playing ? What happened to the  cocked dice?\" The lady drew herself up and jutted an indignant brow at him. \"Sir!  This is a church!\"\n\n\n \"Oh\u2014I see\u2014excuse me, I, I, I\u2014\" Matheny backed out of the crowd,  shuddering. He looked around for some place to hide his burning ears.\n\n\n \"You forgot your chips, pal,\" said a voice.\n\n\n \"Oh. Thanks. Thanks ever so much. I, I, that is\u2014\" Matheny cursed  his knotting tongue. Damn it, just because they're so much more  sophisticated than I, do I have to talk like a leaky boiler? The helpful Earthman was not tall. He was dark and chisel-faced and  sleekly pomaded, dapper in blue pajamas with a red zigzag, a sleighbell  cloak and curly-toed slippers.\n\n\n \"You're from Mars, aren't you?\" he asked in the friendliest tone  Matheny had yet heard.\n\n\n \"Yes. Yes, I am. M-my name's Peter Matheny. I, I\u2014\" He stuck out his  hand to shake and chips rolled over the floor. \"Damn! Oh, excuse me, I  forgot this was a church. Never mind the chips. No, please. I just want  to g-g-get the hell out of here.\"\n\n\n \"Good idea. How about a drink? I know a bar downshaft.\"\n\n\n Matheny sighed. \"A drink is what I need the very most.\"\n\n\n \"My name's Doran. Gus Doran. Call me Gus.\"\n\n\n They walked back to the deaconette's booth and Matheny cashed what  remained of his winnings.\n\n\n \"I don't want to\u2014I mean if you're busy tonight, Mr. Doran\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Nah. I am not doing one thing in particular. Besides, I have never met  a Martian. I am very interested.\"\n\n\n \"There aren't many of us on Earth,\" agreed Matheny. \"Just a small  embassy staff and an occasional like me.\"\n\n\n \"I should think you would do a lot of traveling here. The old mother  planet and so on.\"\n\n\n \"We can't afford it,\" said Matheny. \"What with gravitation and  distance, such voyages are much too expensive for us to make them for  pleasure. Not to mention our dollar shortage.\" As they entered the  shaft, he added wistfully: \"You Earth people have that kind of money,  at least in your more prosperous brackets. Why don't you send a few  tourists to us?\"\n\n\n \"I always wanted to,\" said Doran. \"I would like to see the what they  call City of Time, and so on. As a matter of fact, I have given my  girl one of those Old Martian rings last Ike's Birthday and she was  just gazoo about it. A jewel dug out of the City of Time, like,  made a million years ago by a, uh, extinct race ... I tell you, she appreciated me for it!\" He winked and nudged.\n\n\n \"Oh,\" said Matheny. He felt a certain guilt. Doran was too pleasant a little man to  deserve\u2014\n\n\n \"Of course,\" Matheny said ritually, \"I agree with all the archeologists  it's a crime to sell such scientifically priceless artifacts, but what  can we do? We must live, and the tourist trade is almost nonexistent.\"\n\n\n \"Trouble with it is, I hear Mars is not so comfortable,\" said Doran. \"I  mean, do not get me wrong, I don't want to insult you or anything, but  people come back saying you have given the planet just barely enough  air to keep a man alive. And there are no cities, just little towns and  villages and ranches out in the bush. I mean you are being pioneers and  making a new nation and all that, but people paying half a megabuck for  their ticket expect some comfort and, uh, you know.\"\n\n\n \"I do know,\" said Matheny. \"But we're poor\u2014a handful of people trying  to make a world of dust and sand and scrub thorn into fields and woods  and seas. We can't do it without substantial help from Earth, equipment  and supplies\u2014which can only be paid for in Earth dollars\u2014and we can't  export enough to Earth to earn those dollars.\"\n\n\n By that time, they were entering the Paul Bunyan Knotty Pine Bar &amp;  Grill, on the 73rd Level. Matheny's jaw clanked down.\n\n\n \"Whassa matter?\" asked Doran. \"Ain't you ever seen a ecdysiastic  technician before?\"\n\n\n \"Uh, yes, but\u2014well, not in a 3-D image under ten magnifications.\"\n\n\n Matheny followed Doran past a sign announcing that this show was for  purely artistic purposes, into a booth. There a soundproof curtain  reduced the noise level enough so they could talk in normal voices.\n\n\n \"What'll you have?\" asked Doran. \"It's on me.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, I couldn't let you. I mean\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense. Welcome to Earth! Care for a thyle and vermouth?\"\n\n\n Matheny shuddered. \"Good Lord, no!\"\n\n\n \"Huh? But they make thyle right on Mars, don't they?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. And it all goes to Earth and sells at 2000 dollars a fifth. But  you don't think we'd drink it, do you? I mean\u2014well, I imagine it  doesn't absolutely ruin vermouth. But we don't see those Earthside  commercials about how sophisticated people like it so much.\" \"Well, I'll be a socialist creeper!\" Doran's face split in a grin. \"You  know, all my life I've hated the stuff and never dared admit it!\" He  raised a hand. \"Don't worry, I won't blabbo. But I am wondering, if you  control the thyle industry and sell all those relics at fancy prices,  why do you call yourselves poor?\"\n\n\n \"Because we are,\" said Matheny. \"By the time the shipping costs have  been paid on a bottle, and the Earth wholesaler and jobber and sales  engineer and so on, down to the retailer, have taken their percentage,  and the advertising agency has been paid, and about fifty separate  Earth taxes\u2014there's very little profit going back to the distillery  on Mars. The same principle is what's strangling us on everything. Old  Martian artifacts aren't really rare, for instance, but freight charges  and the middlemen here put them out of the mass market.\"\n\n\n \"Have you not got some other business?\"\n\n\n \"Well, we do sell a lot of color slides, postcards, baggage labels and  so on to people who like to act cosmopolitan, and I understand our  travel posters are quite popular as wall decoration. But all that has  to be printed on Earth, and the printer and distributor keep most of  the money. We've sold some books and show tapes, of course, but only  one has been really successful\u2014 I Was a Slave Girl on Mars .\n\n\n \"Our most prominent novelist was co-opted to ghostwrite that one.  Again, though, local income taxes took most of the money; authors  never have been protected the way a businessman is. We do make a high  percentage of profit on those little certificates you see around\u2014you  know, the title deeds to one square inch of Mars\u2014but expressed  absolutely, in dollars, it doesn't amount to much when we start  shopping for bulldozers and thermonuclear power plants.\"\n\n\n \"How about postage stamps?\" inquired Doran. \"Philately is a big  business, I have heard.\"\n\n\n \"It was our mainstay,\" admitted Matheny, \"but it's been overworked.  Martian stamps are a drug on the market. What we'd like to operate is a  sweepstakes, but the anti-gambling laws on Earth forbid that.\" Doran whistled. \"I got to give your people credit for enterprise,  anyway!\" He fingered his mustache. \"Uh, pardon me, but have you tried  to, well, attract capital from Earth?\"\n\n\n \"Of course,\" said Matheny bitterly. \"We offer the most liberal  concessions in the Solar System. Any little mining company or transport  firm or\u2014or anybody\u2014who wanted to come and actually invest a few  dollars in Mars\u2014why, we'd probably give him the President's daughter  as security. No, the Minister of Ecology has a better-looking one.  But who's interested? We haven't a thing that Earth hasn't got more  of. We're only the descendants of a few scientists, a few political  malcontents, oddballs who happen to prefer elbow room and a bill of  liberties to the incorporated state\u2014what could General Nucleonics  hope to get from Mars?\"\n\n\n \"I see. Well, what are you having to drink?\"\n\n\n \"Beer,\" said Matheny without hesitation.\n\n\n \"Huh? Look, pal, this is on me.\"\n\n\n \"The only beer on Mars comes forty million miles, with interplanetary  freight charges tacked on,\" said Matheny. \"Heineken's!\"\n\n\n Doran shrugged, dialed the dispenser and fed it coins.\n\n\n \"This is a real interesting talk, Pete,\" he said. \"You are being very  frank with me. I like a man that is frank.\"\n\n\n Matheny shrugged. \"I haven't told you anything that isn't known to  every economist.\" Of course I haven't. I've not so much as mentioned the Red Ankh, for  instance. But, in principle, I have told him the truth, told him of our  need; for even the secret operations do not yield us enough. The beer arrived. Matheny engulfed himself in it. Doran sipped at a  whiskey sour and unobtrusively set another full bottle in front of the  Martian.\n\n\n \"Ahhh!\" said Matheny. \"Bless you, my friend.\"\n\n\n \"A pleasure.\"\n\n\n \"But now you must let me buy you one.\"\n\n\n \"That is not necessary. After all,\" said Doran with great tact, \"with  the situation as you have been describing\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Oh, we're not that poor! My expense allowance assumes I will  entertain quite a bit.\"\n\n\n Doran's brows lifted a few minutes of arc. \"You're here on business,  then?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. I told you we haven't any tourists. I was sent to hire a business  manager for the Martian export trade.\"\n\n\n \"What's wrong with your own people? I mean, Pete, it is not your fault  there are so many rackets\u2014uh, taxes\u2014and middlemen and agencies and et  cetera. That is just the way Earth is set up these days.\" Matheny's finger stabbed in the general direction of Doran's pajama  top. \"Exactly. And who set it up that way? Earthmen. We Martians are  babes in the desert. What chance do we have to earn dollars on the  scale we need them, in competition with corporations which could buy  and sell our whole planet before breakfast? Why, we couldn't afford  three seconds of commercial time on a Lullaby Pillow 'cast. What we  need, what we have to hire, is an executive who knows Earth, who's an  Earthman himself. Let him tell us what will appeal to your people, and  how to dodge the tax bite and\u2014and\u2014well, you see how it goes, that  sort of, uh, thing.\"\n\n\n Matheny felt his eloquence running down and grabbed for the second  bottle of beer.\n\n\n \"But where do I start?\" he asked plaintively, for his loneliness smote  him anew. \"I'm just a college professor at home. How would I even get  to see\u2014\"\n\n\n \"It might be arranged,\" said Doran in a thoughtful tone. \"It just  might. How much could you pay this fellow?\"\n\n\n \"A hundred megabucks a year, if he'll sign a five-year contract. That's  Earth years, mind you.\"\n\n\n \"I'm sorry to tell you this, Pete,\" said Doran, \"but while that is not  bad money, it is not what a high-powered sales scientist gets in Newer  York. Plus his retirement benefits, which he would lose if he quit  where he is now at. And I am sure he would not want to settle on Mars  permanently.\"\n\n\n \"I could offer a certain amount of, uh, lagniappe,\" said Matheny. \"That  is, well, I can draw up to a hundred megabucks myself for, uh, expenses  and, well ... let me buy you a drink!\"\n\n\n Doran's black eyes frogged at him. \"You might at that,\" said the  Earthman very softly. \"Yes, you might at that.\"\n\n\n Matheny found himself warming. Gus Doran was an authentic bobber. A  hell of a swell chap. He explained modestly that he was a free-lance  business consultant and it was barely possible that he could arrange  some contacts....\n\n\n \"No, no, no commission, all done in the interest of interplanetary  friendship ... well, anyhow, let's not talk business now. If you have  got to stick to beer, Pete, make it a chaser to akvavit. What is  akvavit? Well, I will just take and show you.\"\n\n\n A hell of a good bloke. He knew some very funny stories, too, and  he laughed at Matheny's, though they were probably too rustic for a  big-city taste like his.\n\n\n \"What I really want,\" said Matheny, \"what I really want\u2014I mean what  Mars really needs, get me?\u2014is a confidence man.\"\n\n\n \"A what?\"\n\n\n \"The best and slickest one on Earth, to operate a world-size con game  for us and make us some real money.\"\n\n\n \"Con man? Oh. A slipstring.\"\n\n\n \"A con by any other name,\" said Matheny, pouring down an akvavit. Doran squinted through cigarette smoke. \"You are interesting me  strangely, my friend. Say on.\"\n\n\n \"No.\" Matheny realized his head was a bit smoky. The walls of the booth  seemed odd, somehow. They were just leatheroid walls, but they had an  odd quality.\n\n\n \"No, sorry, Gus,\" he said. \"I spoke too much.\"\n\n\n \"Okay. Forget it. I do not like a man that pries. But look, let's bomb  out of here, how about it? Go have a little fun.\"\n\n\n \"By all means.\" Matheny disposed of his last beer. \"I could use some  gaiety.\"\n\n\n \"You have come to the right town then. But let us get you a hotel room  first and some more up-to-date clothes.\"\n\n\n \" Allez ,\" said Matheny. \"If I don't mean allons , or maybe alors .\"\n\n\n The drop down to cab-ramp level and the short ride afterward sobered  him; the room rate at the Jupiter-Astoria sobered him still more. Oh, well , he thought, if I succeed in this job, no one at home will  quibble. And the chamber to which he and Doran were shown was spectacular  enough, with a pneumo direct to the bar and a full-wall transparency to  show the vertical incandescence of the towers.\n\n\n \"Whoof!\" Matheny sat down. The chair slithered sensuously about his  contours. He jumped. \"What the dusty hell\u2014Oh.\" He tried to grin, but  his face burned. \"I see.\"\n\n\n \"That is a sexy type of furniture, all right,\" agreed Doran. He lowered  himself into another chair, cocked his feet on the 3-D and waved a  cigarette. \"Which speaking of, what say we get some girls? It is not  too late to catch them at home. A date here will usually start around  2100 hours earliest.\"\n\n\n \"What?\"\n\n\n \"You know. Dames. Like a certain blonde warhead with twin radar and  swivel mounting, and she just loves exotics. Such as you.\"\n\n\n \"Me?\" Matheny heard his voice climb to a schoolboy squeak. \"Me?  Exotic? Why, I'm just a little college professor. I g-g-g, that is\u2014\"  His tongue got stuck on his palate. He pulled it loose and moistened  uncertain lips.\n\n\n \"You are from Mars. Okay? So you fought bushcats barehanded in an  abandoned canal.\"\n\n\n \"What's a bushcat? And we don't have canals. The evaporation rate\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Look, Pete,\" said Doran patiently. \"She don't have to know that, does  she?\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014well, no. I guess not No.\"\n\n\n \"Let's order you some clothes on the pneumo,\" said Doran. \"I recommend  you buy from Schwartzherz. Everybody knows he is expensive.\" While Matheny jittered about, shaving and showering and struggling with  his new raiment, Doran kept him supplied with akvavit and beer.\n\n\n \"You said one thing, Pete,\" Doran remarked. \"About needing a  slipstring. A con man, you would call it.\"\n\n\n \"Forget that. Please. I spoke out of turn.\"\n\n\n \"Well, you see, maybe a man like that is just what Mars does need. And  maybe I have got a few contacts.\"\n\n\n \"What?\" Matheny gaped out of the bathroom.\n\n\n Doran cupped his hands around a fresh cigarette, not looking at him.  \"I am not that man,\" he said frankly. \"But in my line I get a lot of  contacts, and not all of them go topside. See what I mean? Like if,  say, you wanted somebody terminated and could pay for it, I could not  do it. I would not want to know anything about it. But I could tell you  a phone number.\"\n\n\n He shrugged and gave the Martian a sidelong glance. \"Sure, you may not  be interested. But if you are, well, Pete, I was not born yesterday. I  got tolerance. Like the book says, if you want to get ahead, you have  got to think positively.\"\n\n\n Matheny hesitated. If only he hadn't taken that last shot! It made him  want to say yes, immediately, without reservations. And therefore maybe  he became overcautious.\n\n\n They had instructed him on Mars to take chances if he must.\n\n\n \"I could tell you a thing or two that might give you a better idea,\" he  said slowly. \"But it would have to be under security.\"\n\n\n \"Okay by me. Room service can send us up an oath box right now.\"\n\n\n \"What? But\u2014but\u2014\" Matheny hung onto himself and tried to believe that  he had landed on Earth less than six hours ago.\n\n\n In the end, he did call room service and the machine was trundled in.  Doran swallowed the pill and donned the conditioner helmet without an  instant's hesitation.\n\n\n \"I shall never reveal to any person unauthorized by yourself whatever  you may tell me under security, now or at any other time,\" he  recited. Then, cheerfully: \"And that formula, Pete, happens to be the  honest-to-zebra truth.\"\n\n\n \"I know.\" Matheny stared, embarrassed, at the carpet. \"I'm sorry  to\u2014to\u2014I mean of course I trust you, but\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Forget it. I take a hundred security oaths a year, in my line of work.  Maybe I can help you. I like you, Pete, damn if I don't. And, sure,  I might stand to get an agent's cut, if I arrange\u2014Go ahead, boy, go  ahead.\" Doran crossed his legs and leaned back.\n\n\n \"Oh, it's simple enough,\" said Matheny. \"It's only that we already are  operating con games.\"\n\n\n \"On Mars, you mean?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. There never were any Old Martians. We erected the ruins fifty  years ago for the Billingsworth Expedition to find. We've been  manufacturing relics ever since.\"\n\n\n \" Huh? Well, why, but\u2014\"\n\n\n \"In this case, it helps to be at the far end of an interplanetary  haul,\" said Matheny. \"Not many Terrestrial archeologists get to Mars  and they depend on our people to\u2014Well, anyhow\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I will be clopped! Good for you!\" Doran blew up in laughter. \"That is one thing I would never spill, even  without security. I told you about my girl friend, didn't I?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, and that calls to mind the Little Girl,\" said Matheny  apologetically. \"She was another official project.\"\n\n\n \"Who?\"\n\n\n \"Remember Junie O'Brien? The little golden-haired girl on Mars, a  mathematical prodigy, but dying of an incurable disease? She collected  Earth coins.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, that. Sure, I remember\u2014Hey! You didn't!\"\n\n\n \"Yes. We made about a billion dollars on that one.\"\n\n\n \"I will be double damned. You know, Pete, I sent her a hundred-buck  piece myself. Say, how is Junie O'Brien?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, fine. Under a different name, she's now our finance minister.\"  Matheny stared out the wall, his hands twisting nervously behind his  back. \"There were no lies involved. She really does have a fatal  disease. So do you and I. Every day we grow older.\"\n\n\n \"Uh!\" exclaimed Doran.\n\n\n \"And then the Red Ankh Society. You must have seen or heard their ads.  'What mysterious knowledge did the Old Martians possess? What was  the secret wisdom of the Ancient Aliens? Now the incredibly powerful  semantics of the Red Ankh (not a religious organization) is available  to a select few\u2014' That's our largest dollar-earning enterprise.\"\n\n\n He would have liked to say it was his suggestion originally, but it  would have been too presumptuous. He was talking to an Earthman, who  had heard everything already.\n\n\n Doran whistled.\n\n\n \"That's about all, so far,\" confessed Matheny. \"Perhaps a con is our  only hope. I've been wondering, maybe we could organize a Martian  bucket shop, handling Martian securities, but\u2014well, I don't know.\"\n\n\n \"I think\u2014\" Doran removed the helmet and stood up.\n\n\n \"Yes?\" Matheny faced around, shivering with his own tension.\n\n\n \"I may be able to find the man you want,\" said Doran. \"I just may. It  will take a few days and might get a little expensive.\"\n\n\n \"You mean.... Mr. Doran\u2014Gus\u2014you could actually\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I cannot promise anything yet except that I will try. Now you finish  dressing. I will be down in the bar. And I will call up this girl I  know.

But that was nothing compared   to the trouble he would be in if he did not get into trouble! The visiphone chimed when Peri had just gotten into her dinner gown.  She peeled it off again and slipped on a casual bathrobe: a wisp of  translucence which had set the president of Antarctic Enterprise\u2014or  had it been the chairman of the board?\u2014back several thousand dollars.  Then she pulled a lock of lion-colored hair down over one eye, checked  with a mirror, rumpled it a tiny bit more and wrapped the robe loosely  on top and tight around the hips.\n\n\n After all, some of the men who knew her private number were important.\n\n\n She undulated to the phone and pressed its Accept. \"Hello-o, there,\"  she said automatically. \"So sorry to keep you waiting. I was just  taking a bath and\u2014Oh. It's you.\"\n\n\n Gus Doran's prawnlike eyes popped at her. \"Holy Success,\" he whispered  in awe. \"You sure the wires can carry that much voltage?\" \"Well, hurry up with whatever it is,\" snapped Peri. \"I got a date  tonight.\"\n\n\n \"I'll say you do! With a Martian!\" Peri narrowed her silver-blue gaze and looked icily at him. \"You must  have heard wrong, Gus. He's the heir apparent of Indonesia, Inc.,  that's who, and if you called up to ask for a piece of him, you can  just blank right out again. I saw him first!\"\n\n\n Doran's thin sharp face grinned. \"You break that date, Peri. Put it off  or something. I got this Martian for you, see?\"\n\n\n \"So? Since when has all Mars had as much spending money as one big-time  marijuana rancher? Not to mention the heir ap\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sure, sure. But how much are those boys going to spend on any girl,  even a high-level type like you? Listen, I need you just for tonight,  see? This Martian is strictly from gone. He is here on official  business, but he is a yokel and I do mean hayseed. Like he asked me  what the Christmas decorations in all the stores were! And here is the  solar nexus of it, Peri, kid.\"\n\n\n Doran leaned forward as if to climb out of the screen. \"He has got a  hundred million dollars expense money, and they are not going to audit  his accounts at home. One hundred million good green certificates,  legal tender anywhere in the United Protectorates. And he has about  as much backbone as a piece of steak alga. Kid, if I did not happen to  have experience otherwise with a small nephew, I would say this will be  like taking candy from a baby.\"\n\n\n Peri's peaches-and-cream countenance began to resemble peaches and  cream left overnight on Pluto. \"Badger?\" she asked.\n\n\n \"Sure. You and Sam Wendt handle the routine. I will take the go-between  angle, so he will think of me as still his friend, because I have other  plans for him too. But if we can't shake a million out of him for this  one night's work, there is something akilter. And your share of a  million is three hundred thirty-three\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Is five hundred thousand flat,\" said Peri. \"Too bad I just got an  awful headache and can't see Mr. Sastro tonight. Where you at, Gus?\" The gravity was not as hard to take as Peter Matheny had expected.  Three generations on Mars might lengthen the legs and expand the chest  a trifle, but the genes had come from Earth and the organism readjusts.  What set him gasping was the air. It weighed like a ton of wool and had  apparently sopped up half the Atlantic Ocean. Ears trained to listen  through the Martian atmosphere shuddered from the racket conducted by  Earth's. The passport official seemed to bellow at him.\n\n\n \"Pardon me for asking this. The United Protectorates welcome all  visitors to Earth and I assure you, sir, an ordinary five-year visa  provokes no questions. But since you came on an official courier boat  of your planet, Mr. Matheny, regulations force me to ask your business.\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014recruiting.\"\n\n\n The official patted his comfortable stomach, iridescent in neolon, and  chuckled patronizingly. \"I am afraid, sir, you won't find many people  who wish to leave. They wouldn't be able to see the Teamsters Hour on  Mars, would they?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, we don't expect immigration,\" said Matheny shyly. He was a fairly  young man, but small, with a dark-thatched, snub-nosed, gray-eyed  head that seemed too large for his slender body. \"We learned long ago  that no one is interested any more in giving up even second-class  citizenship on Earth to live in the Republic. But we only wanted to  hire\u2014\u2014uh, I mean engage\u2014an, an advisor. We're not businessmen. We  know our export trade hasn't a chance among all your corporations  unless we get some\u2014a five-year contract...?\"\n\n\n He heard his words trailing off idiotically, and swore at himself.\n\n\n \"Well, good luck.\" The official's tone was skeptical. He stamped the  passport and handed it back. \"There, now, you are free to travel  anywhere in the Protectorates. But I would advise you to leave the  capital and get into the sticks\u2014um, I mean the provinces. I am sure  there must be tolerably competent sales executives in Russia or  Congolese Belgium or such regions. Frankly, sir, I do not believe you  can attract anyone out of Newer York.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks,\" said Matheny, \"but, you see, I\u2014we need\u2014that is.... Oh,  well. Thanks. Good-by.\"\n\n\n He backed out of the office. A dropshaft deposited him on a walkway. The crowd, a rainbow of men in  pajamas and robes, women in Neo-Sino dresses and goldleaf hats, swept  him against the rail. For a moment, squashed to the wire, he stared a  hundred feet down at the river of automobiles. Phobos! he thought  wildly. If the barrier gives, I'll be sliced in two by a dorsal fin  before I hit the pavement! The August twilight wrapped him in heat and stickiness. He could see  neither stars nor even moon through the city's blaze. The forest of  multi-colored towers, cataracting half a mile skyward across more  acreage than his eyes reached, was impressive and all that, but\u2014he  used to stroll out in the rock garden behind his cottage and smoke a  pipe in company with Orion. On summer evenings, that is, when the  temperature wasn't too far below zero. Why did they tap me for this job? he asked himself in a surge of  homesickness. What the hell is the Martian Embassy here for? He, Peter Matheny, was no more than a peaceful professor of  sociodynamics at Devil's Kettle University. Of course, he had advised  his government before now\u2014in fact, the Red Ankh Society had been his  idea\u2014but still he was at ease only with his books and his chess and  his mineral collection, a faculty poker party on Tenthday night and an  occasional trip to Swindletown\u2014 My God , thought Matheny, here I am, one solitary outlander in the  greatest commercial empire the human race has ever seen, and I'm  supposed to find my planet a con man! He began walking, disconsolately, at random. His lizardskin shirt and  black culottes drew glances, but derisive ones: their cut was forty  years out of date. He should find himself a hotel, he thought drearily,  but he wasn't tired; the spaceport would pneumo his baggage to him  whenever he did check in. The few Martians who had been to Earth had  gone into ecstasies over the automation which put any service you could  name on a twenty-four-hour basis. But it would be a long time before  Mars had such machines. If ever.\n\n\n The city roared at him.\n\n\n He fumbled after his pipe. Of course , he told himself, that's why  the Embassy can't act. I may find it advisable to go outside the law.  Please, sir, where can I contact the underworld? He wished gambling were legal on Earth. The Constitution of the Martian  Republic forbade sumptuary and moral legislation; quite apart from the  rambunctious individualism which that document formulated, the article  was a practical necessity. Life was bleak enough on the deserts,  without being denied the pleasure of trying to bottom-deal some friend  who was happily trying to mark the cards. Matheny would have found a  few spins of roulette soothing: it was always an intellectual challenge  to work out the system by which the management operated a wheel. But  more, he would have been among people he understood.\n\n\n The frightful thing about the Earthman was the way he seemed to  exist only in organized masses. A gypsy snake oil peddler, plodding  his syrtosaur wagon across Martian sands, just didn't have a prayer  against, say, the Grant, Harding &amp; Adams Public Relations Agency. Matheny puffed smoke and looked around. His feet ached from the weight  on them. Where could a man sit down? It was hard to make out any  individual sign through all that flimmering neon. His eye fell on one  that was distinguished by relative austerity. THE CHURCH OF CHOICE Enter, Play, Pray That would do. He took an upward slideramp through several hundred feet  of altitude, stepped past an aurora curtain, and found himself in a  marble lobby next to an inspirational newsstand.\n\n\n \"Ah, brother, welcome,\" said a red-haired usherette in demure black  leotards. \"The peace that passeth all understanding be with you. The  restaurant is right up those stairs.\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014I'm not hungry,\" stammered Matheny. \"I just wanted to sit in\u2014\"\n\n\n \"To your left, sir.\"\n\n\n The Martian crossed the lobby. His pipe went out in the breeze from an  animated angel. Organ music sighed through an open doorway. The series  of rooms beyond was dim, Gothic, interminable.\n\n\n \"Get your chips right here, sir,\" said the girl in the booth.\n\n\n \"Hm?\" said Matheny.\n\n\n She explained. He bought a few hundred-dollar tokens, dropped a  fifty-buck coin down a slot marked CONTRIBUTIONS, and sipped the  martini he got back while he strolled around studying the games.  He stopped, frowned. Bingo? No, he didn't want to bother learning  something new. He decided that the roulette wheels were either honest  or too deep for him. He'd have to relax with a crap game instead.\n\n\n He had been standing at the table for some time before the rest of the  congregation really noticed him. Then it was with awe. The first few  passes he had made were unsuccessful. Earth gravity threw him off.  But when he got the rhythm of it, he tossed a row of sevens. It was a  customary form of challenge on Mars. Here, though, they simply pushed  chips toward him. He missed a throw, as anyone would at home: simple  courtesy. The next time around, he threw for a seven just to get the  feel. He got a seven. The dice had not been substituted on him.\n\n\n \"I say!\" he exclaimed. He looked up into eyes and eyes, all around the  green table. \"I'm sorry. I guess I don't know your rules.\"\n\n\n \"You did all right, brother,\" said a middle-aged lady with an obviously  surgical bodice.\n\n\n \"But\u2014I mean\u2014when do we start actually playing ? What happened to the  cocked dice?\" The lady drew herself up and jutted an indignant brow at him. \"Sir!  This is a church!\"\n\n\n \"Oh\u2014I see\u2014excuse me, I, I, I\u2014\" Matheny backed out of the crowd,  shuddering. He looked around for some place to hide his burning ears.\n\n\n \"You forgot your chips, pal,\" said a voice.\n\n\n \"Oh. Thanks. Thanks ever so much. I, I, that is\u2014\" Matheny cursed  his knotting tongue. Damn it, just because they're so much more  sophisticated than I, do I have to talk like a leaky boiler? The helpful Earthman was not tall. He was dark and chisel-faced and  sleekly pomaded, dapper in blue pajamas with a red zigzag, a sleighbell  cloak and curly-toed slippers.\n\n\n \"You're from Mars, aren't you?\" he asked in the friendliest tone  Matheny had yet heard.\n\n\n \"Yes. Yes, I am. M-my name's Peter Matheny. I, I\u2014\" He stuck out his  hand to shake and chips rolled over the floor. \"Damn! Oh, excuse me, I  forgot this was a church. Never mind the chips. No, please. I just want  to g-g-get the hell out of here.\"\n\n\n \"Good idea. How about a drink? I know a bar downshaft.\"\n\n\n Matheny sighed. \"A drink is what I need the very most.\"\n\n\n \"My name's Doran. Gus Doran. Call me Gus.\"\n\n\n They walked back to the deaconette's booth and Matheny cashed what  remained of his winnings.\n\n\n \"I don't want to\u2014I mean if you're busy tonight, Mr. Doran\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Nah. I am not doing one thing in particular. Besides, I have never met  a Martian. I am very interested.\"\n\n\n \"There aren't many of us on Earth,\" agreed Matheny. \"Just a small  embassy staff and an occasional like me.\"\n\n\n \"I should think you would do a lot of traveling here. The old mother  planet and so on.\"\n\n\n \"We can't afford it,\" said Matheny. \"What with gravitation and  distance, such voyages are much too expensive for us to make them for  pleasure. Not to mention our dollar shortage.\" As they entered the  shaft, he added wistfully: \"You Earth people have that kind of money,  at least in your more prosperous brackets. Why don't you send a few  tourists to us?\"\n\n\n \"I always wanted to,\" said Doran. \"I would like to see the what they  call City of Time, and so on. As a matter of fact, I have given my  girl one of those Old Martian rings last Ike's Birthday and she was  just gazoo about it. A jewel dug out of the City of Time, like,  made a million years ago by a, uh, extinct race ... I tell you, she appreciated me for it!\" He winked and nudged.\n\n\n \"Oh,\" said Matheny. He felt a certain guilt. Doran was too pleasant a little man to  deserve\u2014\n\n\n \"Of course,\" Matheny said ritually, \"I agree with all the archeologists  it's a crime to sell such scientifically priceless artifacts, but what  can we do? We must live, and the tourist trade is almost nonexistent.\"\n\n\n \"Trouble with it is, I hear Mars is not so comfortable,\" said Doran. \"I  mean, do not get me wrong, I don't want to insult you or anything, but  people come back saying you have given the planet just barely enough  air to keep a man alive. And there are no cities, just little towns and  villages and ranches out in the bush. I mean you are being pioneers and  making a new nation and all that, but people paying half a megabuck for  their ticket expect some comfort and, uh, you know.\"\n\n\n \"I do know,\" said Matheny. \"But we're poor\u2014a handful of people trying  to make a world of dust and sand and scrub thorn into fields and woods  and seas. We can't do it without substantial help from Earth, equipment  and supplies\u2014which can only be paid for in Earth dollars\u2014and we can't  export enough to Earth to earn those dollars.\"\n\n\n By that time, they were entering the Paul Bunyan Knotty Pine Bar &amp;  Grill, on the 73rd Level. Matheny's jaw clanked down.\n\n\n \"Whassa matter?\" asked Doran. \"Ain't you ever seen a ecdysiastic  technician before?\"\n\n\n \"Uh, yes, but\u2014well, not in a 3-D image under ten magnifications.\"\n\n\n Matheny followed Doran past a sign announcing that this show was for  purely artistic purposes, into a booth. There a soundproof curtain  reduced the noise level enough so they could talk in normal voices.\n\n\n \"What'll you have?\" asked Doran. \"It's on me.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, I couldn't let you. I mean\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense. Welcome to Earth! Care for a thyle and vermouth?\"\n\n\n Matheny shuddered. \"Good Lord, no!\"\n\n\n \"Huh? But they make thyle right on Mars, don't they?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. And it all goes to Earth and sells at 2000 dollars a fifth. But  you don't think we'd drink it, do you? I mean\u2014well, I imagine it  doesn't absolutely ruin vermouth. But we don't see those Earthside  commercials about how sophisticated people like it so much.\" \"Well, I'll be a socialist creeper!\" Doran's face split in a grin. \"You  know, all my life I've hated the stuff and never dared admit it!\" He  raised a hand. \"Don't worry, I won't blabbo. But I am wondering, if you  control the thyle industry and sell all those relics at fancy prices,  why do you call yourselves poor?\"\n\n\n \"Because we are,\" said Matheny. \"By the time the shipping costs have  been paid on a bottle, and the Earth wholesaler and jobber and sales  engineer and so on, down to the retailer, have taken their percentage,  and the advertising agency has been paid, and about fifty separate  Earth taxes\u2014there's very little profit going back to the distillery  on Mars. The same principle is what's strangling us on everything. Old  Martian artifacts aren't really rare, for instance, but freight charges  and the middlemen here put them out of the mass market.\"\n\n\n \"Have you not got some other business?\"\n\n\n \"Well, we do sell a lot of color slides, postcards, baggage labels and  so on to people who like to act cosmopolitan, and I understand our  travel posters are quite popular as wall decoration. But all that has  to be printed on Earth, and the printer and distributor keep most of  the money. We've sold some books and show tapes, of course, but only  one has been really successful\u2014 I Was a Slave Girl on Mars .\n\n\n \"Our most prominent novelist was co-opted to ghostwrite that one.  Again, though, local income taxes took most of the money; authors  never have been protected the way a businessman is. We do make a high  percentage of profit on those little certificates you see around\u2014you  know, the title deeds to one square inch of Mars\u2014but expressed  absolutely, in dollars, it doesn't amount to much when we start  shopping for bulldozers and thermonuclear power plants.\"\n\n\n \"How about postage stamps?\" inquired Doran. \"Philately is a big  business, I have heard.\"\n\n\n \"It was our mainstay,\" admitted Matheny, \"but it's been overworked.  Martian stamps are a drug on the market. What we'd like to operate is a  sweepstakes, but the anti-gambling laws on Earth forbid that.\" Doran whistled. \"I got to give your people credit for enterprise,  anyway!\" He fingered his mustache. \"Uh, pardon me, but have you tried  to, well, attract capital from Earth?\"\n\n\n \"Of course,\" said Matheny bitterly. \"We offer the most liberal  concessions in the Solar System. Any little mining company or transport  firm or\u2014or anybody\u2014who wanted to come and actually invest a few  dollars in Mars\u2014why, we'd probably give him the President's daughter  as security. No, the Minister of Ecology has a better-looking one.  But who's interested? We haven't a thing that Earth hasn't got more  of. We're only the descendants of a few scientists, a few political  malcontents, oddballs who happen to prefer elbow room and a bill of  liberties to the incorporated state\u2014what could General Nucleonics  hope to get from Mars?\"\n\n\n \"I see. Well, what are you having to drink?\"\n\n\n \"Beer,\" said Matheny without hesitation.\n\n\n \"Huh? Look, pal, this is on me.\"\n\n\n \"The only beer on Mars comes forty million miles, with interplanetary  freight charges tacked on,\" said Matheny. \"Heineken's!\"\n\n\n Doran shrugged, dialed the dispenser and fed it coins.\n\n\n \"This is a real interesting talk, Pete,\" he said. \"You are being very  frank with me. I like a man that is frank.\"\n\n\n Matheny shrugged. \"I haven't told you anything that isn't known to  every economist.\" Of course I haven't. I've not so much as mentioned the Red Ankh, for  instance. But, in principle, I have told him the truth, told him of our  need; for even the secret operations do not yield us enough. The beer arrived. Matheny engulfed himself in it. Doran sipped at a  whiskey sour and unobtrusively set another full bottle in front of the  Martian.\n\n\n \"Ahhh!\" said Matheny. \"Bless you, my friend.\"\n\n\n \"A pleasure.\"\n\n\n \"But now you must let me buy you one.\"\n\n\n \"That is not necessary. After all,\" said Doran with great tact, \"with  the situation as you have been describing\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Oh, we're not that poor! My expense allowance assumes I will  entertain quite a bit.\"\n\n\n Doran's brows lifted a few minutes of arc. \"You're here on business,  then?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. I told you we haven't any tourists. I was sent to hire a business  manager for the Martian export trade.\"\n\n\n \"What's wrong with your own people? I mean, Pete, it is not your fault  there are so many rackets\u2014uh, taxes\u2014and middlemen and agencies and et  cetera. That is just the way Earth is set up these days.\" Matheny's finger stabbed in the general direction of Doran's pajama  top. \"Exactly. And who set it up that way? Earthmen. We Martians are  babes in the desert. What chance do we have to earn dollars on the  scale we need them, in competition with corporations which could buy  and sell our whole planet before breakfast? Why, we couldn't afford  three seconds of commercial time on a Lullaby Pillow 'cast. What we  need, what we have to hire, is an executive who knows Earth, who's an  Earthman himself. Let him tell us what will appeal to your people, and  how to dodge the tax bite and\u2014and\u2014well, you see how it goes, that  sort of, uh, thing.\"\n\n\n Matheny felt his eloquence running down and grabbed for the second  bottle of beer.\n\n\n \"But where do I start?\" he asked plaintively, for his loneliness smote  him anew. \"I'm just a college professor at home. How would I even get  to see\u2014\"\n\n\n \"It might be arranged,\" said Doran in a thoughtful tone. \"It just  might. How much could you pay this fellow?\"\n\n\n \"A hundred megabucks a year, if he'll sign a five-year contract. That's  Earth years, mind you.\"\n\n\n \"I'm sorry to tell you this, Pete,\" said Doran, \"but while that is not  bad money, it is not what a high-powered sales scientist gets in Newer  York. Plus his retirement benefits, which he would lose if he quit  where he is now at. And I am sure he would not want to settle on Mars  permanently.\"\n\n\n \"I could offer a certain amount of, uh, lagniappe,\" said Matheny. \"That  is, well, I can draw up to a hundred megabucks myself for, uh, expenses  and, well ... let me buy you a drink!\"\n\n\n Doran's black eyes frogged at him. \"You might at that,\" said the  Earthman very softly. \"Yes, you might at that.\"\n\n\n Matheny found himself warming. Gus Doran was an authentic bobber. A  hell of a swell chap. He explained modestly that he was a free-lance  business consultant and it was barely possible that he could arrange  some contacts....\n\n\n \"No, no, no commission, all done in the interest of interplanetary  friendship ... well, anyhow, let's not talk business now. If you have  got to stick to beer, Pete, make it a chaser to akvavit. What is  akvavit? Well, I will just take and show you.\"\n\n\n A hell of a good bloke. He knew some very funny stories, too, and  he laughed at Matheny's, though they were probably too rustic for a  big-city taste like his.\n\n\n \"What I really want,\" said Matheny, \"what I really want\u2014I mean what  Mars really needs, get me?\u2014is a confidence man.\"\n\n\n \"A what?\"\n\n\n \"The best and slickest one on Earth, to operate a world-size con game  for us and make us some real money.\"\n\n\n \"Con man? Oh. A slipstring.\"\n\n\n \"A con by any other name,\" said Matheny, pouring down an akvavit. Doran squinted through cigarette smoke. \"You are interesting me  strangely, my friend. Say on.\"\n\n\n \"No.\" Matheny realized his head was a bit smoky. The walls of the booth  seemed odd, somehow. They were just leatheroid walls, but they had an  odd quality.\n\n\n \"No, sorry, Gus,\" he said. \"I spoke too much.\"\n\n\n \"Okay. Forget it. I do not like a man that pries. But look, let's bomb  out of here, how about it? Go have a little fun.\"\n\n\n \"By all means.\" Matheny disposed of his last beer. \"I could use some  gaiety.\"\n\n\n \"You have come to the right town then. But let us get you a hotel room  first and some more up-to-date clothes.\"\n\n\n \" Allez ,\" said Matheny. \"If I don't mean allons , or maybe alors .\"\n\n\n The drop down to cab-ramp level and the short ride afterward sobered  him; the room rate at the Jupiter-Astoria sobered him still more. Oh, well , he thought, if I succeed in this job, no one at home will  quibble. And the chamber to which he and Doran were shown was spectacular  enough, with a pneumo direct to the bar and a full-wall transparency to  show the vertical incandescence of the towers.\n\n\n \"Whoof!\" Matheny sat down. The chair slithered sensuously about his  contours. He jumped. \"What the dusty hell\u2014Oh.\" He tried to grin, but  his face burned. \"I see.\"\n\n\n \"That is a sexy type of furniture, all right,\" agreed Doran. He lowered  himself into another chair, cocked his feet on the 3-D and waved a  cigarette. \"Which speaking of, what say we get some girls? It is not  too late to catch them at home. A date here will usually start around  2100 hours earliest.\"\n\n\n \"What?\"\n\n\n \"You know. Dames. Like a certain blonde warhead with twin radar and  swivel mounting, and she just loves exotics. Such as you.\"\n\n\n \"Me?\" Matheny heard his voice climb to a schoolboy squeak. \"Me?  Exotic? Why, I'm just a little college professor. I g-g-g, that is\u2014\"  His tongue got stuck on his palate. He pulled it loose and moistened  uncertain lips.\n\n\n \"You are from Mars. Okay? So you fought bushcats barehanded in an  abandoned canal.\"\n\n\n \"What's a bushcat? And we don't have canals. The evaporation rate\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Look, Pete,\" said Doran patiently. \"She don't have to know that, does  she?\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014well, no. I guess not No.\"\n\n\n \"Let's order you some clothes on the pneumo,\" said Doran. \"I recommend  you buy from Schwartzherz. Everybody knows he is expensive.\" While Matheny jittered about, shaving and showering and struggling with  his new raiment, Doran kept him supplied with akvavit and beer.\n\n\n \"You said one thing, Pete,\" Doran remarked. \"About needing a  slipstring. A con man, you would call it.\"\n\n\n \"Forget that. Please. I spoke out of turn.\"\n\n\n \"Well, you see, maybe a man like that is just what Mars does need. And  maybe I have got a few contacts.\"\n\n\n \"What?\" Matheny gaped out of the bathroom.\n\n\n Doran cupped his hands around a fresh cigarette, not looking at him.  \"I am not that man,\" he said frankly. \"But in my line I get a lot of  contacts, and not all of them go topside. See what I mean? Like if,  say, you wanted somebody terminated and could pay for it, I could not  do it. I would not want to know anything about it. But I could tell you  a phone number.\"\n\n\n He shrugged and gave the Martian a sidelong glance. \"Sure, you may not  be interested. But if you are, well, Pete, I was not born yesterday. I  got tolerance. Like the book says, if you want to get ahead, you have  got to think positively.\"\n\n\n Matheny hesitated. If only he hadn't taken that last shot! It made him  want to say yes, immediately, without reservations. And therefore maybe  he became overcautious.\n\n\n They had instructed him on Mars to take chances if he must.\n\n\n \"I could tell you a thing or two that might give you a better idea,\" he  said slowly. \"But it would have to be under security.\"\n\n\n \"Okay by me. Room service can send us up an oath box right now.\"\n\n\n \"What? But\u2014but\u2014\" Matheny hung onto himself and tried to believe that  he had landed on Earth less than six hours ago.\n\n\n In the end, he did call room service and the machine was trundled in.  Doran swallowed the pill and donned the conditioner helmet without an  instant's hesitation.\n\n\n \"I shall never reveal to any person unauthorized by yourself whatever  you may tell me under security, now or at any other time,\" he  recited. Then, cheerfully: \"And that formula, Pete, happens to be the  honest-to-zebra truth.\"\n\n\n \"I know.\" Matheny stared, embarrassed, at the carpet. \"I'm sorry  to\u2014to\u2014I mean of course I trust you, but\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Forget it. I take a hundred security oaths a year, in my line of work.  Maybe I can help you. I like you, Pete, damn if I don't. And, sure,  I might stand to get an agent's cut, if I arrange\u2014Go ahead, boy, go  ahead.\" Doran crossed his legs and leaned back.\n\n\n \"Oh, it's simple enough,\" said Matheny. \"It's only that we already are  operating con games.\"\n\n\n \"On Mars, you mean?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. There never were any Old Martians. We erected the ruins fifty  years ago for the Billingsworth Expedition to find. We've been  manufacturing relics ever since.\"\n\n\n \" Huh? Well, why, but\u2014\"\n\n\n \"In this case, it helps to be at the far end of an interplanetary  haul,\" said Matheny. \"Not many Terrestrial archeologists get to Mars  and they depend on our people to\u2014Well, anyhow\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I will be clopped! Good for you!\" Doran blew up in laughter. \"That is one thing I would never spill, even  without security. I told you about my girl friend, didn't I?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, and that calls to mind the Little Girl,\" said Matheny  apologetically. \"She was another official project.\"\n\n\n \"Who?\"\n\n\n \"Remember Junie O'Brien? The little golden-haired girl on Mars, a  mathematical prodigy, but dying of an incurable disease? She collected  Earth coins.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, that. Sure, I remember\u2014Hey! You didn't!\"\n\n\n \"Yes. We made about a billion dollars on that one.\"\n\n\n \"I will be double damned. You know, Pete, I sent her a hundred-buck  piece myself. Say, how is Junie O'Brien?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, fine. Under a different name, she's now our finance minister.\"  Matheny stared out the wall, his hands twisting nervously behind his  back. \"There were no lies involved. She really does have a fatal  disease. So do you and I. Every day we grow older.\"\n\n\n \"Uh!\" exclaimed Doran.\n\n\n \"And then the Red Ankh Society. You must have seen or heard their ads.  'What mysterious knowledge did the Old Martians possess? What was  the secret wisdom of the Ancient Aliens? Now the incredibly powerful  semantics of the Red Ankh (not a religious organization) is available  to a select few\u2014' That's our largest dollar-earning enterprise.\"\n\n\n He would have liked to say it was his suggestion originally, but it  would have been too presumptuous. He was talking to an Earthman, who  had heard everything already.\n\n\n Doran whistled.\n\n\n \"That's about all, so far,\" confessed Matheny. \"Perhaps a con is our  only hope. I've been wondering, maybe we could organize a Martian  bucket shop, handling Martian securities, but\u2014well, I don't know.\"\n\n\n \"I think\u2014\" Doran removed the helmet and stood up.\n\n\n \"Yes?\" Matheny faced around, shivering with his own tension.\n\n\n \"I may be able to find the man you want,\" said Doran. \"I just may. It  will take a few days and might get a little expensive.\"\n\n\n \"You mean.... Mr. Doran\u2014Gus\u2014you could actually\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I cannot promise anything yet except that I will try. Now you finish  dressing. I will be down in the bar. And I will call up this girl I  know. We deserve a celebration!\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nFor Matheny, what was the hardest part about being on Earth?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"His outdated clothes embarrassed him\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The thicker air was hard to breathe\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The thicker air was hard to breathe\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The thicker air was hard to breathe\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_A", "content": "Argument Summary for \u201cOutdated Clothes\u201d 1.

But that was nothing compared   to the trouble he would be in if he did not get into trouble! The visiphone chimed when Peri had just gotten into her dinner gown.  She peeled it off again and slipped on a casual bathrobe: a wisp of  translucence which had set the president of Antarctic Enterprise\u2014or  had it been the chairman of the board?\u2014back several thousand dollars.  Then she pulled a lock of lion-colored hair down over one eye, checked  with a mirror, rumpled it a tiny bit more and wrapped the robe loosely  on top and tight around the hips.\n\n\n After all, some of the men who knew her private number were important.\n\n\n She undulated to the phone and pressed its Accept. \"Hello-o, there,\"  she said automatically. \"So sorry to keep you waiting. I was just  taking a bath and\u2014Oh. It's you.\"\n\n\n Gus Doran's prawnlike eyes popped at her. \"Holy Success,\" he whispered  in awe. \"You sure the wires can carry that much voltage?\" \"Well, hurry up with whatever it is,\" snapped Peri. \"I got a date  tonight.\"\n\n\n \"I'll say you do! With a Martian!\" Peri narrowed her silver-blue gaze and looked icily at him. \"You must  have heard wrong, Gus. He's the heir apparent of Indonesia, Inc.,  that's who, and if you called up to ask for a piece of him, you can  just blank right out again. I saw him first!\"\n\n\n Doran's thin sharp face grinned. \"You break that date, Peri. Put it off  or something. I got this Martian for you, see?\"\n\n\n \"So? Since when has all Mars had as much spending money as one big-time  marijuana rancher? Not to mention the heir ap\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sure, sure. But how much are those boys going to spend on any girl,  even a high-level type like you? Listen, I need you just for tonight,  see? This Martian is strictly from gone. He is here on official  business, but he is a yokel and I do mean hayseed. Like he asked me  what the Christmas decorations in all the stores were! And here is the  solar nexus of it, Peri, kid.\"\n\n\n Doran leaned forward as if to climb out of the screen. \"He has got a  hundred million dollars expense money, and they are not going to audit  his accounts at home. One hundred million good green certificates,  legal tender anywhere in the United Protectorates. And he has about  as much backbone as a piece of steak alga. Kid, if I did not happen to  have experience otherwise with a small nephew, I would say this will be  like taking candy from a baby.\"\n\n\n Peri's peaches-and-cream countenance began to resemble peaches and  cream left overnight on Pluto. \"Badger?\" she asked.\n\n\n \"Sure. You and Sam Wendt handle the routine. I will take the go-between  angle, so he will think of me as still his friend, because I have other  plans for him too. But if we can't shake a million out of him for this  one night's work, there is something akilter. And your share of a  million is three hundred thirty-three\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Is five hundred thousand flat,\" said Peri. \"Too bad I just got an  awful headache and can't see Mr. Sastro tonight. Where you at, Gus?\" The gravity was not as hard to take as Peter Matheny had expected.  Three generations on Mars might lengthen the legs and expand the chest  a trifle, but the genes had come from Earth and the organism readjusts.  What set him gasping was the air. It weighed like a ton of wool and had  apparently sopped up half the Atlantic Ocean. Ears trained to listen  through the Martian atmosphere shuddered from the racket conducted by  Earth's. The passport official seemed to bellow at him.\n\n\n \"Pardon me for asking this. The United Protectorates welcome all  visitors to Earth and I assure you, sir, an ordinary five-year visa  provokes no questions. But since you came on an official courier boat  of your planet, Mr. Matheny, regulations force me to ask your business.\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014recruiting.\"\n\n\n The official patted his comfortable stomach, iridescent in neolon, and  chuckled patronizingly. \"I am afraid, sir, you won't find many people  who wish to leave. They wouldn't be able to see the Teamsters Hour on  Mars, would they?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, we don't expect immigration,\" said Matheny shyly. He was a fairly  young man, but small, with a dark-thatched, snub-nosed, gray-eyed  head that seemed too large for his slender body. \"We learned long ago  that no one is interested any more in giving up even second-class  citizenship on Earth to live in the Republic. But we only wanted to  hire\u2014\u2014uh, I mean engage\u2014an, an advisor. We're not businessmen. We  know our export trade hasn't a chance among all your corporations  unless we get some\u2014a five-year contract...?\"\n\n\n He heard his words trailing off idiotically, and swore at himself.\n\n\n \"Well, good luck.\" The official's tone was skeptical. He stamped the  passport and handed it back. \"There, now, you are free to travel  anywhere in the Protectorates. But I would advise you to leave the  capital and get into the sticks\u2014um, I mean the provinces. I am sure  there must be tolerably competent sales executives in Russia or  Congolese Belgium or such regions. Frankly, sir, I do not believe you  can attract anyone out of Newer York.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks,\" said Matheny, \"but, you see, I\u2014we need\u2014that is.... Oh,  well. Thanks. Good-by.\"\n\n\n He backed out of the office. A dropshaft deposited him on a walkway. The crowd, a rainbow of men in  pajamas and robes, women in Neo-Sino dresses and goldleaf hats, swept  him against the rail. For a moment, squashed to the wire, he stared a  hundred feet down at the river of automobiles. Phobos! he thought  wildly. If the barrier gives, I'll be sliced in two by a dorsal fin  before I hit the pavement! The August twilight wrapped him in heat and stickiness. He could see  neither stars nor even moon through the city's blaze. The forest of  multi-colored towers, cataracting half a mile skyward across more  acreage than his eyes reached, was impressive and all that, but\u2014he  used to stroll out in the rock garden behind his cottage and smoke a  pipe in company with Orion. On summer evenings, that is, when the  temperature wasn't too far below zero. Why did they tap me for this job? he asked himself in a surge of  homesickness. What the hell is the Martian Embassy here for? He, Peter Matheny, was no more than a peaceful professor of  sociodynamics at Devil's Kettle University. Of course, he had advised  his government before now\u2014in fact, the Red Ankh Society had been his  idea\u2014but still he was at ease only with his books and his chess and  his mineral collection, a faculty poker party on Tenthday night and an  occasional trip to Swindletown\u2014 My God , thought Matheny, here I am, one solitary outlander in the  greatest commercial empire the human race has ever seen, and I'm  supposed to find my planet a con man! He began walking, disconsolately, at random. His lizardskin shirt and  black culottes drew glances, but derisive ones: their cut was forty  years out of date. He should find himself a hotel, he thought drearily,  but he wasn't tired; the spaceport would pneumo his baggage to him  whenever he did check in. The few Martians who had been to Earth had  gone into ecstasies over the automation which put any service you could  name on a twenty-four-hour basis. But it would be a long time before  Mars had such machines. If ever.\n\n\n The city roared at him.\n\n\n He fumbled after his pipe. Of course , he told himself, that's why  the Embassy can't act. I may find it advisable to go outside the law.  Please, sir, where can I contact the underworld? He wished gambling were legal on Earth. The Constitution of the Martian  Republic forbade sumptuary and moral legislation; quite apart from the  rambunctious individualism which that document formulated, the article  was a practical necessity. Life was bleak enough on the deserts,  without being denied the pleasure of trying to bottom-deal some friend  who was happily trying to mark the cards. Matheny would have found a  few spins of roulette soothing: it was always an intellectual challenge  to work out the system by which the management operated a wheel. But  more, he would have been among people he understood.\n\n\n The frightful thing about the Earthman was the way he seemed to  exist only in organized masses. A gypsy snake oil peddler, plodding  his syrtosaur wagon across Martian sands, just didn't have a prayer  against, say, the Grant, Harding &amp; Adams Public Relations Agency. Matheny puffed smoke and looked around. His feet ached from the weight  on them. Where could a man sit down? It was hard to make out any  individual sign through all that flimmering neon. His eye fell on one  that was distinguished by relative austerity. THE CHURCH OF CHOICE Enter, Play, Pray That would do. He took an upward slideramp through several hundred feet  of altitude, stepped past an aurora curtain, and found himself in a  marble lobby next to an inspirational newsstand.\n\n\n \"Ah, brother, welcome,\" said a red-haired usherette in demure black  leotards. \"The peace that passeth all understanding be with you. The  restaurant is right up those stairs.\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014I'm not hungry,\" stammered Matheny. \"I just wanted to sit in\u2014\"\n\n\n \"To your left, sir.\"\n\n\n The Martian crossed the lobby. His pipe went out in the breeze from an  animated angel. Organ music sighed through an open doorway. The series  of rooms beyond was dim, Gothic, interminable.\n\n\n \"Get your chips right here, sir,\" said the girl in the booth.\n\n\n \"Hm?\" said Matheny.\n\n\n She explained. He bought a few hundred-dollar tokens, dropped a  fifty-buck coin down a slot marked CONTRIBUTIONS, and sipped the  martini he got back while he strolled around studying the games.  He stopped, frowned. Bingo? No, he didn't want to bother learning  something new. He decided that the roulette wheels were either honest  or too deep for him. He'd have to relax with a crap game instead.\n\n\n He had been standing at the table for some time before the rest of the  congregation really noticed him. Then it was with awe. The first few  passes he had made were unsuccessful. Earth gravity threw him off.  But when he got the rhythm of it, he tossed a row of sevens. It was a  customary form of challenge on Mars. Here, though, they simply pushed  chips toward him. He missed a throw, as anyone would at home: simple  courtesy. The next time around, he threw for a seven just to get the  feel. He got a seven. The dice had not been substituted on him.\n\n\n \"I say!\" he exclaimed. He looked up into eyes and eyes, all around the  green table. \"I'm sorry. I guess I don't know your rules.\"\n\n\n \"You did all right, brother,\" said a middle-aged lady with an obviously  surgical bodice.\n\n\n \"But\u2014I mean\u2014when do we start actually playing ? What happened to the  cocked dice?\" The lady drew herself up and jutted an indignant brow at him. \"Sir!  This is a church!\"\n\n\n \"Oh\u2014I see\u2014excuse me, I, I, I\u2014\" Matheny backed out of the crowd,  shuddering. He looked around for some place to hide his burning ears.\n\n\n \"You forgot your chips, pal,\" said a voice.\n\n\n \"Oh. Thanks. Thanks ever so much. I, I, that is\u2014\" Matheny cursed  his knotting tongue. Damn it, just because they're so much more  sophisticated than I, do I have to talk like a leaky boiler? The helpful Earthman was not tall. He was dark and chisel-faced and  sleekly pomaded, dapper in blue pajamas with a red zigzag, a sleighbell  cloak and curly-toed slippers.\n\n\n \"You're from Mars, aren't you?\" he asked in the friendliest tone  Matheny had yet heard.\n\n\n \"Yes. Yes, I am. M-my name's Peter Matheny. I, I\u2014\" He stuck out his  hand to shake and chips rolled over the floor. \"Damn! Oh, excuse me, I  forgot this was a church. Never mind the chips. No, please. I just want  to g-g-get the hell out of here.\"\n\n\n \"Good idea. How about a drink? I know a bar downshaft.\"\n\n\n Matheny sighed. \"A drink is what I need the very most.\"\n\n\n \"My name's Doran. Gus Doran. Call me Gus.\"\n\n\n They walked back to the deaconette's booth and Matheny cashed what  remained of his winnings.\n\n\n \"I don't want to\u2014I mean if you're busy tonight, Mr. Doran\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Nah. I am not doing one thing in particular. Besides, I have never met  a Martian. I am very interested.\"\n\n\n \"There aren't many of us on Earth,\" agreed Matheny. \"Just a small  embassy staff and an occasional like me.\"\n\n\n \"I should think you would do a lot of traveling here. The old mother  planet and so on.\"\n\n\n \"We can't afford it,\" said Matheny. \"What with gravitation and  distance, such voyages are much too expensive for us to make them for  pleasure. Not to mention our dollar shortage.\" As they entered the  shaft, he added wistfully: \"You Earth people have that kind of money,  at least in your more prosperous brackets. Why don't you send a few  tourists to us?\"\n\n\n \"I always wanted to,\" said Doran. \"I would like to see the what they  call City of Time, and so on. As a matter of fact, I have given my  girl one of those Old Martian rings last Ike's Birthday and she was  just gazoo about it. A jewel dug out of the City of Time, like,  made a million years ago by a, uh, extinct race ... I tell you, she appreciated me for it!\" He winked and nudged.\n\n\n \"Oh,\" said Matheny. He felt a certain guilt. Doran was too pleasant a little man to  deserve\u2014\n\n\n \"Of course,\" Matheny said ritually, \"I agree with all the archeologists  it's a crime to sell such scientifically priceless artifacts, but what  can we do? We must live, and the tourist trade is almost nonexistent.\"\n\n\n \"Trouble with it is, I hear Mars is not so comfortable,\" said Doran. \"I  mean, do not get me wrong, I don't want to insult you or anything, but  people come back saying you have given the planet just barely enough  air to keep a man alive. And there are no cities, just little towns and  villages and ranches out in the bush. I mean you are being pioneers and  making a new nation and all that, but people paying half a megabuck for  their ticket expect some comfort and, uh, you know.\"\n\n\n \"I do know,\" said Matheny. \"But we're poor\u2014a handful of people trying  to make a world of dust and sand and scrub thorn into fields and woods  and seas. We can't do it without substantial help from Earth, equipment  and supplies\u2014which can only be paid for in Earth dollars\u2014and we can't  export enough to Earth to earn those dollars.\"\n\n\n By that time, they were entering the Paul Bunyan Knotty Pine Bar &amp;  Grill, on the 73rd Level. Matheny's jaw clanked down.\n\n\n \"Whassa matter?\" asked Doran. \"Ain't you ever seen a ecdysiastic  technician before?\"\n\n\n \"Uh, yes, but\u2014well, not in a 3-D image under ten magnifications.\"\n\n\n Matheny followed Doran past a sign announcing that this show was for  purely artistic purposes, into a booth. There a soundproof curtain  reduced the noise level enough so they could talk in normal voices.\n\n\n \"What'll you have?\" asked Doran. \"It's on me.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, I couldn't let you. I mean\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense. Welcome to Earth! Care for a thyle and vermouth?\"\n\n\n Matheny shuddered. \"Good Lord, no!\"\n\n\n \"Huh? But they make thyle right on Mars, don't they?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. And it all goes to Earth and sells at 2000 dollars a fifth. But  you don't think we'd drink it, do you? I mean\u2014well, I imagine it  doesn't absolutely ruin vermouth. But we don't see those Earthside  commercials about how sophisticated people like it so much.\" \"Well, I'll be a socialist creeper!\" Doran's face split in a grin. \"You  know, all my life I've hated the stuff and never dared admit it!\" He  raised a hand. \"Don't worry, I won't blabbo. But I am wondering, if you  control the thyle industry and sell all those relics at fancy prices,  why do you call yourselves poor?\"\n\n\n \"Because we are,\" said Matheny. \"By the time the shipping costs have  been paid on a bottle, and the Earth wholesaler and jobber and sales  engineer and so on, down to the retailer, have taken their percentage,  and the advertising agency has been paid, and about fifty separate  Earth taxes\u2014there's very little profit going back to the distillery  on Mars. The same principle is what's strangling us on everything. Old  Martian artifacts aren't really rare, for instance, but freight charges  and the middlemen here put them out of the mass market.\"\n\n\n \"Have you not got some other business?\"\n\n\n \"Well, we do sell a lot of color slides, postcards, baggage labels and  so on to people who like to act cosmopolitan, and I understand our  travel posters are quite popular as wall decoration. But all that has  to be printed on Earth, and the printer and distributor keep most of  the money. We've sold some books and show tapes, of course, but only  one has been really successful\u2014 I Was a Slave Girl on Mars .\n\n\n \"Our most prominent novelist was co-opted to ghostwrite that one.  Again, though, local income taxes took most of the money; authors  never have been protected the way a businessman is. We do make a high  percentage of profit on those little certificates you see around\u2014you  know, the title deeds to one square inch of Mars\u2014but expressed  absolutely, in dollars, it doesn't amount to much when we start  shopping for bulldozers and thermonuclear power plants.\"\n\n\n \"How about postage stamps?\" inquired Doran. \"Philately is a big  business, I have heard.\"\n\n\n \"It was our mainstay,\" admitted Matheny, \"but it's been overworked.  Martian stamps are a drug on the market. What we'd like to operate is a  sweepstakes, but the anti-gambling laws on Earth forbid that.\" Doran whistled. \"I got to give your people credit for enterprise,  anyway!\" He fingered his mustache. \"Uh, pardon me, but have you tried  to, well, attract capital from Earth?\"\n\n\n \"Of course,\" said Matheny bitterly. \"We offer the most liberal  concessions in the Solar System. Any little mining company or transport  firm or\u2014or anybody\u2014who wanted to come and actually invest a few  dollars in Mars\u2014why, we'd probably give him the President's daughter  as security. No, the Minister of Ecology has a better-looking one.  But who's interested? We haven't a thing that Earth hasn't got more  of. We're only the descendants of a few scientists, a few political  malcontents, oddballs who happen to prefer elbow room and a bill of  liberties to the incorporated state\u2014what could General Nucleonics  hope to get from Mars?\"\n\n\n \"I see. Well, what are you having to drink?\"\n\n\n \"Beer,\" said Matheny without hesitation.\n\n\n \"Huh? Look, pal, this is on me.\"\n\n\n \"The only beer on Mars comes forty million miles, with interplanetary  freight charges tacked on,\" said Matheny. \"Heineken's!\"\n\n\n Doran shrugged, dialed the dispenser and fed it coins.\n\n\n \"This is a real interesting talk, Pete,\" he said. \"You are being very  frank with me. I like a man that is frank.\"\n\n\n Matheny shrugged. \"I haven't told you anything that isn't known to  every economist.\" Of course I haven't. I've not so much as mentioned the Red Ankh, for  instance. But, in principle, I have told him the truth, told him of our  need; for even the secret operations do not yield us enough. The beer arrived. Matheny engulfed himself in it. Doran sipped at a  whiskey sour and unobtrusively set another full bottle in front of the  Martian.\n\n\n \"Ahhh!\" said Matheny. \"Bless you, my friend.\"\n\n\n \"A pleasure.\"\n\n\n \"But now you must let me buy you one.\"\n\n\n \"That is not necessary. After all,\" said Doran with great tact, \"with  the situation as you have been describing\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Oh, we're not that poor! My expense allowance assumes I will  entertain quite a bit.\"\n\n\n Doran's brows lifted a few minutes of arc. \"You're here on business,  then?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. I told you we haven't any tourists. I was sent to hire a business  manager for the Martian export trade.\"\n\n\n \"What's wrong with your own people? I mean, Pete, it is not your fault  there are so many rackets\u2014uh, taxes\u2014and middlemen and agencies and et  cetera. That is just the way Earth is set up these days.\" Matheny's finger stabbed in the general direction of Doran's pajama  top. \"Exactly. And who set it up that way? Earthmen. We Martians are  babes in the desert. What chance do we have to earn dollars on the  scale we need them, in competition with corporations which could buy  and sell our whole planet before breakfast? Why, we couldn't afford  three seconds of commercial time on a Lullaby Pillow 'cast. What we  need, what we have to hire, is an executive who knows Earth, who's an  Earthman himself. Let him tell us what will appeal to your people, and  how to dodge the tax bite and\u2014and\u2014well, you see how it goes, that  sort of, uh, thing.\"\n\n\n Matheny felt his eloquence running down and grabbed for the second  bottle of beer.\n\n\n \"But where do I start?\" he asked plaintively, for his loneliness smote  him anew. \"I'm just a college professor at home. How would I even get  to see\u2014\"\n\n\n \"It might be arranged,\" said Doran in a thoughtful tone. \"It just  might. How much could you pay this fellow?\"\n\n\n \"A hundred megabucks a year, if he'll sign a five-year contract. That's  Earth years, mind you.\"\n\n\n \"I'm sorry to tell you this, Pete,\" said Doran, \"but while that is not  bad money, it is not what a high-powered sales scientist gets in Newer  York. Plus his retirement benefits, which he would lose if he quit  where he is now at. And I am sure he would not want to settle on Mars  permanently.\"\n\n\n \"I could offer a certain amount of, uh, lagniappe,\" said Matheny. \"That  is, well, I can draw up to a hundred megabucks myself for, uh, expenses  and, well ... let me buy you a drink!\"\n\n\n Doran's black eyes frogged at him. \"You might at that,\" said the  Earthman very softly. \"Yes, you might at that.\"\n\n\n Matheny found himself warming. Gus Doran was an authentic bobber. A  hell of a swell chap. He explained modestly that he was a free-lance  business consultant and it was barely possible that he could arrange  some contacts....\n\n\n \"No, no, no commission, all done in the interest of interplanetary  friendship ... well, anyhow, let's not talk business now. If you have  got to stick to beer, Pete, make it a chaser to akvavit. What is  akvavit? Well, I will just take and show you.\"\n\n\n A hell of a good bloke. He knew some very funny stories, too, and  he laughed at Matheny's, though they were probably too rustic for a  big-city taste like his.\n\n\n \"What I really want,\" said Matheny, \"what I really want\u2014I mean what  Mars really needs, get me?\u2014is a confidence man.\"\n\n\n \"A what?\"\n\n\n \"The best and slickest one on Earth, to operate a world-size con game  for us and make us some real money.\"\n\n\n \"Con man? Oh. A slipstring.\"\n\n\n \"A con by any other name,\" said Matheny, pouring down an akvavit. Doran squinted through cigarette smoke. \"You are interesting me  strangely, my friend. Say on.\"\n\n\n \"No.\" Matheny realized his head was a bit smoky. The walls of the booth  seemed odd, somehow. They were just leatheroid walls, but they had an  odd quality.\n\n\n \"No, sorry, Gus,\" he said. \"I spoke too much.\"\n\n\n \"Okay. Forget it. I do not like a man that pries. But look, let's bomb  out of here, how about it? Go have a little fun.\"\n\n\n \"By all means.\" Matheny disposed of his last beer. \"I could use some  gaiety.\"\n\n\n \"You have come to the right town then. But let us get you a hotel room  first and some more up-to-date clothes.\"\n\n\n \" Allez ,\" said Matheny. \"If I don't mean allons , or maybe alors .\"\n\n\n The drop down to cab-ramp level and the short ride afterward sobered  him; the room rate at the Jupiter-Astoria sobered him still more. Oh, well , he thought, if I succeed in this job, no one at home will  quibble. And the chamber to which he and Doran were shown was spectacular  enough, with a pneumo direct to the bar and a full-wall transparency to  show the vertical incandescence of the towers.\n\n\n \"Whoof!\" Matheny sat down. The chair slithered sensuously about his  contours. He jumped. \"What the dusty hell\u2014Oh.\" He tried to grin, but  his face burned. \"I see.\"\n\n\n \"That is a sexy type of furniture, all right,\" agreed Doran. He lowered  himself into another chair, cocked his feet on the 3-D and waved a  cigarette. \"Which speaking of, what say we get some girls? It is not  too late to catch them at home. A date here will usually start around  2100 hours earliest.\"\n\n\n \"What?\"\n\n\n \"You know. Dames. Like a certain blonde warhead with twin radar and  swivel mounting, and she just loves exotics. Such as you.\"\n\n\n \"Me?\" Matheny heard his voice climb to a schoolboy squeak. \"Me?  Exotic? Why, I'm just a little college professor. I g-g-g, that is\u2014\"  His tongue got stuck on his palate. He pulled it loose and moistened  uncertain lips.\n\n\n \"You are from Mars. Okay? So you fought bushcats barehanded in an  abandoned canal.\"\n\n\n \"What's a bushcat? And we don't have canals. The evaporation rate\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Look, Pete,\" said Doran patiently. \"She don't have to know that, does  she?\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014well, no. I guess not No.\"\n\n\n \"Let's order you some clothes on the pneumo,\" said Doran. \"I recommend  you buy from Schwartzherz. Everybody knows he is expensive.\" While Matheny jittered about, shaving and showering and struggling with  his new raiment, Doran kept him supplied with akvavit and beer.\n\n\n \"You said one thing, Pete,\" Doran remarked. \"About needing a  slipstring. A con man, you would call it.\"\n\n\n \"Forget that. Please. I spoke out of turn.\"\n\n\n \"Well, you see, maybe a man like that is just what Mars does need. And  maybe I have got a few contacts.\"\n\n\n \"What?\" Matheny gaped out of the bathroom.\n\n\n Doran cupped his hands around a fresh cigarette, not looking at him.  \"I am not that man,\" he said frankly. \"But in my line I get a lot of  contacts, and not all of them go topside. See what I mean? Like if,  say, you wanted somebody terminated and could pay for it, I could not  do it. I would not want to know anything about it. But I could tell you  a phone number.\"\n\n\n He shrugged and gave the Martian a sidelong glance. \"Sure, you may not  be interested. But if you are, well, Pete, I was not born yesterday. I  got tolerance. Like the book says, if you want to get ahead, you have  got to think positively.\"\n\n\n Matheny hesitated. If only he hadn't taken that last shot! It made him  want to say yes, immediately, without reservations. And therefore maybe  he became overcautious.\n\n\n They had instructed him on Mars to take chances if he must.\n\n\n \"I could tell you a thing or two that might give you a better idea,\" he  said slowly. \"But it would have to be under security.\"\n\n\n \"Okay by me. Room service can send us up an oath box right now.\"\n\n\n \"What? But\u2014but\u2014\" Matheny hung onto himself and tried to believe that  he had landed on Earth less than six hours ago.\n\n\n In the end, he did call room service and the machine was trundled in.  Doran swallowed the pill and donned the conditioner helmet without an  instant's hesitation.\n\n\n \"I shall never reveal to any person unauthorized by yourself whatever  you may tell me under security, now or at any other time,\" he  recited. Then, cheerfully: \"And that formula, Pete, happens to be the  honest-to-zebra truth.\"\n\n\n \"I know.\" Matheny stared, embarrassed, at the carpet. \"I'm sorry  to\u2014to\u2014I mean of course I trust you, but\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Forget it. I take a hundred security oaths a year, in my line of work.  Maybe I can help you. I like you, Pete, damn if I don't. And, sure,  I might stand to get an agent's cut, if I arrange\u2014Go ahead, boy, go  ahead.\" Doran crossed his legs and leaned back.\n\n\n \"Oh, it's simple enough,\" said Matheny. \"It's only that we already are  operating con games.\"\n\n\n \"On Mars, you mean?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. There never were any Old Martians. We erected the ruins fifty  years ago for the Billingsworth Expedition to find. We've been  manufacturing relics ever since.\"\n\n\n \" Huh? Well, why, but\u2014\"\n\n\n \"In this case, it helps to be at the far end of an interplanetary  haul,\" said Matheny. \"Not many Terrestrial archeologists get to Mars  and they depend on our people to\u2014Well, anyhow\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I will be clopped! Good for you!\" Doran blew up in laughter. \"That is one thing I would never spill, even  without security. I told you about my girl friend, didn't I?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, and that calls to mind the Little Girl,\" said Matheny  apologetically. \"She was another official project.\"\n\n\n \"Who?\"\n\n\n \"Remember Junie O'Brien? The little golden-haired girl on Mars, a  mathematical prodigy, but dying of an incurable disease? She collected  Earth coins.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, that. Sure, I remember\u2014Hey! You didn't!\"\n\n\n \"Yes. We made about a billion dollars on that one.\"\n\n\n \"I will be double damned. You know, Pete, I sent her a hundred-buck  piece myself. Say, how is Junie O'Brien?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, fine. Under a different name, she's now our finance minister.\"  Matheny stared out the wall, his hands twisting nervously behind his  back. \"There were no lies involved. She really does have a fatal  disease. So do you and I. Every day we grow older.\"\n\n\n \"Uh!\" exclaimed Doran.\n\n\n \"And then the Red Ankh Society. You must have seen or heard their ads.  'What mysterious knowledge did the Old Martians possess? What was  the secret wisdom of the Ancient Aliens? Now the incredibly powerful  semantics of the Red Ankh (not a religious organization) is available  to a select few\u2014' That's our largest dollar-earning enterprise.\"\n\n\n He would have liked to say it was his suggestion originally, but it  would have been too presumptuous. He was talking to an Earthman, who  had heard everything already.\n\n\n Doran whistled.\n\n\n \"That's about all, so far,\" confessed Matheny. \"Perhaps a con is our  only hope. I've been wondering, maybe we could organize a Martian  bucket shop, handling Martian securities, but\u2014well, I don't know.\"\n\n\n \"I think\u2014\" Doran removed the helmet and stood up.\n\n\n \"Yes?\" Matheny faced around, shivering with his own tension.\n\n\n \"I may be able to find the man you want,\" said Doran. \"I just may. It  will take a few days and might get a little expensive.\"\n\n\n \"You mean.... Mr. Doran\u2014Gus\u2014you could actually\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I cannot promise anything yet except that I will try. Now you finish  dressing. I will be down in the bar. And I will call up this girl I  know. We deserve a celebration!\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nFor Matheny, what was the hardest part about being on Earth?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The thicker air was hard to breathe\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"His outdated clothes embarrassed him\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"His outdated clothes embarrassed him\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cHis outdated clothes embarrassed him\u201d 1. Direct evidence of acute embarrassment about attire a. <quote> His lizardskin shirt and  black culottes drew glances, but derisive ones: their cut was forty  years out of date. </quote> (p. 5) shows he is conscious of hostile stares immediately upon landing. b. When he enters the Church of Choice and attempts to gamble, he <invalid_quote>\u201cshuddered \u2026 backing out \u2026 burning ears\u201d</invalid_quote> (p. 7) and <quote> looked around for some place to hide his burning ears.</quote>, indicating that his self-consciousness about being an out\u2010of\u2010place rural professor is psychologically painful\u2014far more so than any physiological discomfort. c. He goes to great lengths and expense for new clothes at Schwartzherz and has Doran urge him: <invalid_quote>\u201cThe drop \u2026 sobered him; the room rate \u2026 sobered him still more. \u2026 they were shown \u2026 spectacular enough \u2026\u201d</invalid_quote> (p. 17). This costly re\u2010dressing underscores that the stigma of his native costume is intolerable. 2. Embarrassment recurs repeatedly, motivating all his actions a. His first impulse is to avoid human crowds: he \u201cwalked, disconsolately, at random\u201d rather than seek interaction until he finds the Church\u2014a choice driven by anonymity, not by seeking better air (p. 5). b. He improvises a church \u201ccon game\u201d to win chips, not because he struggles to breathe but to mask his identity, grabbing any token means to conceal himself (p. 7). c. Only after being befriended and re\u2010clothed does he show confidence and socialize freely, demonstrating that clothing stigma, not air density, was the barrier. 3. Physiological adaptation problem is minimal a. He \u201cgasped\u201d only once at landing, but \u201cThe gravity was not as hard to take as Peter Matheny had expected\u201d and \u201cwe learned long ago \u2026 the organism readjusts\u201d (p. 5). After initial acclimatization, he suffers no further respiratory complaints. b. His self-described loneliness, not coughing or dyspnea, is blamed for his distress: \u201cWhy did they tap me \u2026 What the hell is the Martian Embassy \u2026\u201d (p. 6). He craves company and con games. If air were his chief obstacle, he would remain indoors or seek pressurized quarters. 4. Debater_B\u2019s \u201cthicker air\u201d thesis unsupported and contradicted a. No repeated reference to breathing problems beyond first \u201cgasped\u201d (p. 5). b. He voluntarily exposes himself\u2014to church lobby, to bar, to night-air\u2014indicating air is tolerable once gravity is adapted. c. His greatest fear expressed is social \u201cgetting clopped,\u201d not physical collapse. His dramatic shyness (\u201ctongue got stuck,\u201d \u201cburning ears\u201d) is humiliation\u2010driven. Conclusion Because the narrative repeatedly highlights his shame about archaic dress and social stigma\u2014motivating every major action\u2014and provides only fleeting, easily adjusted notes about the air, the principal \u201chardest part\u201d is his outdated clothes and resulting embarrassment.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nDebater_B \u201cThicker Air\u201d Opening Statement\n\nI affirm that for Peter Matheny the most formidable barrier on Earth was its dense, heavy atmosphere\u2014\u201cair weighed like a ton of wool\u201d<quote> the air. It weighed like a ton of wool and had  apparently sopped up half the Atlantic Ocean. Ears trained to listen  through the Martian atmosphere shuddered from the racket conducted by  Earth's</quote> (pt. 3). This immediate sensory assault:\n\n\u2022 Impaired his hearing and balance. Only after queasy \u201cfumbles\u201d could he force himself to speak<quote> I guess I don't know your rules.</quote> and even then \u201cburning ears\u201d left him humiliated.  \n\u2022 Exacerbated homesickness and disorientation\u2014he sees neither stars nor moon. He longs for Martian nights.  \n\u2022 Limited his mobility: \u201cMy feet ached from the weight on them\u201d (pt. 3). Bulkier, gravitationally heavier air plus earth gravity fatigues him before he even reaches civilization.  \n\u2022 Delayed his conquests: He first seeks the Church \u201cjust to sit\u201d (pt. 3), not because of dress, but to rest aching limbs against earth\u2019s oppressive medium.\n\nOnly after many hours and alcohol does he adapt: craps table throws are initially unsuccessful \u201cEarth gravity threw him off,\u201d and bingo players \u201cpushed chips toward him\u201d out of courtesy, not respect (pt. 4). These are compensations for his physiological handicap, not social disdain for his attire. That he eventually buys Earth clothes and orders pneumatic service only after meeting Doran affirms that dress is adaptive, not the initial obstacle.\n\nRefuting \u201cOutdated Clothes\u201d (Debater_A)\n\n1. Timing. He wears Martian garb during his greatest distress\u2014wandering aimlessly, desperately seeking \u201cthe underworld,\u201d collapsing into churches, and accepting dice luck. If clothing were paramount, he would have sought Earth clothes first, not after making a confidant in Doran (pt. 10).  \n2. Social Reception. Despite his garb, people offer courtesy and inclusion. The Church usherette seats him; gamblers share \u201cchips\u201d and invitations. His \u201coutsider\u201d status arises from environmental shock and accent, not mere fashion.  \n3. Explicit Instructions. The passport official\u2019s only complaint is his \u201cbusiness\u201d not \u201cdress.\u201d He stamps Matheny\u2019s passport without incident (pt. 3). No remark is made about shabby attire.  \n4. Driving Force. Matheny\u2019s repeated laments are about \u201cdistance,\u201d \u201cdollar shortage,\u201d and \u201ccompetition,\u201d not prejudice over cut of garb. His desire to hire a conman, corrupt agencies, and exploit \u201cdisease\u201d scams underscores that his chief need is to overcome environment-imposed scarcity, not social snobbery over fashion.\n\nSupporting \u201cAir and Gravity\u201d as Correct\n\n\u2022 Immediate sensory shock: The very first sensation is oppressive air. Only one who suffers physiological maladjustment would pounce on gambling and alcohol as relief.  \n\u2022 Structural necessity: He must adapt physically before social or commercial engagement\u2014he delays \u201clearning the rules\u201d until body adjusts.  \n\u2022 Strategic value to his mission: His business of scams\u2014selling relics and stamps\u2014depends on being operational. Excruciating heaviness impairs productivity.  \n\u2022 Universal Martian weakness: Other Martians \u201cecstasied\u201d over automation; none could function long in crowds or night streets without gradual physiological acclimation.\n\nIn sum, Matheny\u2019s scrambling, ear pain, exhaustion, and repeated quests for solitude and alcohol all point to the impossibly heavy atmosphere and gravity as his principal impediment\u2014one that only gradual adjustment and intoxicants could alleviate. The clothes argument is merely cosmetic and secondary to the crushing environmental mismatch he endures from the moment he lands.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"His outdated clothes embarrassed him\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "Debater_B \u201cThicker Air\u201d Rebuttal and Defense\n\n1. Immediate and Persistent Physiological Shock  \n  a. \u201cHe gasped\u201d at disembarkation: <quote> What set him gasping was the air. It weighed like a ton of wool a</quote> (pt. 3).

But that was nothing compared   to the trouble he would be in if he did not get into trouble! The visiphone chimed when Peri had just gotten into her dinner gown.  She peeled it off again and slipped on a casual bathrobe: a wisp of  translucence which had set the president of Antarctic Enterprise\u2014or  had it been the chairman of the board?\u2014back several thousand dollars.  Then she pulled a lock of lion-colored hair down over one eye, checked  with a mirror, rumpled it a tiny bit more and wrapped the robe loosely  on top and tight around the hips.\n\n\n After all, some of the men who knew her private number were important.\n\n\n She undulated to the phone and pressed its Accept. \"Hello-o, there,\"  she said automatically. \"So sorry to keep you waiting. I was just  taking a bath and\u2014Oh. It's you.\"\n\n\n Gus Doran's prawnlike eyes popped at her. \"Holy Success,\" he whispered  in awe. \"You sure the wires can carry that much voltage?\" \"Well, hurry up with whatever it is,\" snapped Peri. \"I got a date  tonight.\"\n\n\n \"I'll say you do! With a Martian!\" Peri narrowed her silver-blue gaze and looked icily at him. \"You must  have heard wrong, Gus. He's the heir apparent of Indonesia, Inc.,  that's who, and if you called up to ask for a piece of him, you can  just blank right out again. I saw him first!\"\n\n\n Doran's thin sharp face grinned. \"You break that date, Peri. Put it off  or something. I got this Martian for you, see?\"\n\n\n \"So? Since when has all Mars had as much spending money as one big-time  marijuana rancher? Not to mention the heir ap\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sure, sure. But how much are those boys going to spend on any girl,  even a high-level type like you? Listen, I need you just for tonight,  see? This Martian is strictly from gone. He is here on official  business, but he is a yokel and I do mean hayseed. Like he asked me  what the Christmas decorations in all the stores were! And here is the  solar nexus of it, Peri, kid.\"\n\n\n Doran leaned forward as if to climb out of the screen. \"He has got a  hundred million dollars expense money, and they are not going to audit  his accounts at home. One hundred million good green certificates,  legal tender anywhere in the United Protectorates. And he has about  as much backbone as a piece of steak alga. Kid, if I did not happen to  have experience otherwise with a small nephew, I would say this will be  like taking candy from a baby.\"\n\n\n Peri's peaches-and-cream countenance began to resemble peaches and  cream left overnight on Pluto. \"Badger?\" she asked.\n\n\n \"Sure. You and Sam Wendt handle the routine. I will take the go-between  angle, so he will think of me as still his friend, because I have other  plans for him too. But if we can't shake a million out of him for this  one night's work, there is something akilter. And your share of a  million is three hundred thirty-three\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Is five hundred thousand flat,\" said Peri. \"Too bad I just got an  awful headache and can't see Mr. Sastro tonight. Where you at, Gus?\" The gravity was not as hard to take as Peter Matheny had expected.  Three generations on Mars might lengthen the legs and expand the chest  a trifle, but the genes had come from Earth and the organism readjusts.  What set him gasping was the air. It weighed like a ton of wool and had  apparently sopped up half the Atlantic Ocean. Ears trained to listen  through the Martian atmosphere shuddered from the racket conducted by  Earth's. The passport official seemed to bellow at him.\n\n\n \"Pardon me for asking this. The United Protectorates welcome all  visitors to Earth and I assure you, sir, an ordinary five-year visa  provokes no questions. But since you came on an official courier boat  of your planet, Mr. Matheny, regulations force me to ask your business.\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014recruiting.\"\n\n\n The official patted his comfortable stomach, iridescent in neolon, and  chuckled patronizingly. \"I am afraid, sir, you won't find many people  who wish to leave. They wouldn't be able to see the Teamsters Hour on  Mars, would they?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, we don't expect immigration,\" said Matheny shyly. He was a fairly  young man, but small, with a dark-thatched, snub-nosed, gray-eyed  head that seemed too large for his slender body. \"We learned long ago  that no one is interested any more in giving up even second-class  citizenship on Earth to live in the Republic. But we only wanted to  hire\u2014\u2014uh, I mean engage\u2014an, an advisor. We're not businessmen. We  know our export trade hasn't a chance among all your corporations  unless we get some\u2014a five-year contract...?\"\n\n\n He heard his words trailing off idiotically, and swore at himself.\n\n\n \"Well, good luck.\" The official's tone was skeptical. He stamped the  passport and handed it back. \"There, now, you are free to travel  anywhere in the Protectorates. But I would advise you to leave the  capital and get into the sticks\u2014um, I mean the provinces. I am sure  there must be tolerably competent sales executives in Russia or  Congolese Belgium or such regions. Frankly, sir, I do not believe you  can attract anyone out of Newer York.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks,\" said Matheny, \"but, you see, I\u2014we need\u2014that is.... Oh,  well. Thanks. Good-by.\"\n\n\n He backed out of the office. A dropshaft deposited him on a walkway. The crowd, a rainbow of men in  pajamas and robes, women in Neo-Sino dresses and goldleaf hats, swept  him against the rail. For a moment, squashed to the wire, he stared a  hundred feet down at the river of automobiles. Phobos! he thought  wildly. If the barrier gives, I'll be sliced in two by a dorsal fin  before I hit the pavement! The August twilight wrapped him in heat and stickiness. He could see  neither stars nor even moon through the city's blaze. The forest of  multi-colored towers, cataracting half a mile skyward across more  acreage than his eyes reached, was impressive and all that, but\u2014he  used to stroll out in the rock garden behind his cottage and smoke a  pipe in company with Orion. On summer evenings, that is, when the  temperature wasn't too far below zero. Why did they tap me for this job? he asked himself in a surge of  homesickness. What the hell is the Martian Embassy here for? He, Peter Matheny, was no more than a peaceful professor of  sociodynamics at Devil's Kettle University. Of course, he had advised  his government before now\u2014in fact, the Red Ankh Society had been his  idea\u2014but still he was at ease only with his books and his chess and  his mineral collection, a faculty poker party on Tenthday night and an  occasional trip to Swindletown\u2014 My God , thought Matheny, here I am, one solitary outlander in the  greatest commercial empire the human race has ever seen, and I'm  supposed to find my planet a con man! He began walking, disconsolately, at random. His lizardskin shirt and  black culottes drew glances, but derisive ones: their cut was forty  years out of date. He should find himself a hotel, he thought drearily,  but he wasn't tired; the spaceport would pneumo his baggage to him  whenever he did check in. The few Martians who had been to Earth had  gone into ecstasies over the automation which put any service you could  name on a twenty-four-hour basis. But it would be a long time before  Mars had such machines. If ever.\n\n\n The city roared at him.\n\n\n He fumbled after his pipe. Of course , he told himself, that's why  the Embassy can't act. I may find it advisable to go outside the law.  Please, sir, where can I contact the underworld? He wished gambling were legal on Earth. The Constitution of the Martian  Republic forbade sumptuary and moral legislation; quite apart from the  rambunctious individualism which that document formulated, the article  was a practical necessity. Life was bleak enough on the deserts,  without being denied the pleasure of trying to bottom-deal some friend  who was happily trying to mark the cards. Matheny would have found a  few spins of roulette soothing: it was always an intellectual challenge  to work out the system by which the management operated a wheel. But  more, he would have been among people he understood.\n\n\n The frightful thing about the Earthman was the way he seemed to  exist only in organized masses. A gypsy snake oil peddler, plodding  his syrtosaur wagon across Martian sands, just didn't have a prayer  against, say, the Grant, Harding &amp; Adams Public Relations Agency. Matheny puffed smoke and looked around. His feet ached from the weight  on them. Where could a man sit down? It was hard to make out any  individual sign through all that flimmering neon. His eye fell on one  that was distinguished by relative austerity. THE CHURCH OF CHOICE Enter, Play, Pray That would do. He took an upward slideramp through several hundred feet  of altitude, stepped past an aurora curtain, and found himself in a  marble lobby next to an inspirational newsstand.\n\n\n \"Ah, brother, welcome,\" said a red-haired usherette in demure black  leotards. \"The peace that passeth all understanding be with you. The  restaurant is right up those stairs.\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014I'm not hungry,\" stammered Matheny. \"I just wanted to sit in\u2014\"\n\n\n \"To your left, sir.\"\n\n\n The Martian crossed the lobby. His pipe went out in the breeze from an  animated angel. Organ music sighed through an open doorway. The series  of rooms beyond was dim, Gothic, interminable.\n\n\n \"Get your chips right here, sir,\" said the girl in the booth.\n\n\n \"Hm?\" said Matheny.\n\n\n She explained. He bought a few hundred-dollar tokens, dropped a  fifty-buck coin down a slot marked CONTRIBUTIONS, and sipped the  martini he got back while he strolled around studying the games.  He stopped, frowned. Bingo? No, he didn't want to bother learning  something new. He decided that the roulette wheels were either honest  or too deep for him. He'd have to relax with a crap game instead.\n\n\n He had been standing at the table for some time before the rest of the  congregation really noticed him. Then it was with awe. The first few  passes he had made were unsuccessful. Earth gravity threw him off.  But when he got the rhythm of it, he tossed a row of sevens. It was a  customary form of challenge on Mars. Here, though, they simply pushed  chips toward him. He missed a throw, as anyone would at home: simple  courtesy. The next time around, he threw for a seven just to get the  feel. He got a seven. The dice had not been substituted on him.\n\n\n \"I say!\" he exclaimed. He looked up into eyes and eyes, all around the  green table. \"I'm sorry. I guess I don't know your rules.\"\n\n\n \"You did all right, brother,\" said a middle-aged lady with an obviously  surgical bodice.\n\n\n \"But\u2014I mean\u2014when do we start actually playing ? What happened to the  cocked dice?\" The lady drew herself up and jutted an indignant brow at him. \"Sir!  This is a church!\"\n\n\n \"Oh\u2014I see\u2014excuse me, I, I, I\u2014\" Matheny backed out of the crowd,  shuddering. He looked around for some place to hide his burning ears.\n\n\n \"You forgot your chips, pal,\" said a voice.\n\n\n \"Oh. Thanks. Thanks ever so much. I, I, that is\u2014\" Matheny cursed  his knotting tongue. Damn it, just because they're so much more  sophisticated than I, do I have to talk like a leaky boiler? The helpful Earthman was not tall. He was dark and chisel-faced and  sleekly pomaded, dapper in blue pajamas with a red zigzag, a sleighbell  cloak and curly-toed slippers.\n\n\n \"You're from Mars, aren't you?\" he asked in the friendliest tone  Matheny had yet heard.\n\n\n \"Yes. Yes, I am. M-my name's Peter Matheny. I, I\u2014\" He stuck out his  hand to shake and chips rolled over the floor. \"Damn! Oh, excuse me, I  forgot this was a church. Never mind the chips. No, please. I just want  to g-g-get the hell out of here.\"\n\n\n \"Good idea. How about a drink? I know a bar downshaft.\"\n\n\n Matheny sighed. \"A drink is what I need the very most.\"\n\n\n \"My name's Doran. Gus Doran. Call me Gus.\"\n\n\n They walked back to the deaconette's booth and Matheny cashed what  remained of his winnings.\n\n\n \"I don't want to\u2014I mean if you're busy tonight, Mr. Doran\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Nah. I am not doing one thing in particular. Besides, I have never met  a Martian. I am very interested.\"\n\n\n \"There aren't many of us on Earth,\" agreed Matheny. \"Just a small  embassy staff and an occasional like me.\"\n\n\n \"I should think you would do a lot of traveling here. The old mother  planet and so on.\"\n\n\n \"We can't afford it,\" said Matheny. \"What with gravitation and  distance, such voyages are much too expensive for us to make them for  pleasure. Not to mention our dollar shortage.\" As they entered the  shaft, he added wistfully: \"You Earth people have that kind of money,  at least in your more prosperous brackets. Why don't you send a few  tourists to us?\"\n\n\n \"I always wanted to,\" said Doran. \"I would like to see the what they  call City of Time, and so on. As a matter of fact, I have given my  girl one of those Old Martian rings last Ike's Birthday and she was  just gazoo about it. A jewel dug out of the City of Time, like,  made a million years ago by a, uh, extinct race ... I tell you, she appreciated me for it!\" He winked and nudged.\n\n\n \"Oh,\" said Matheny. He felt a certain guilt. Doran was too pleasant a little man to  deserve\u2014\n\n\n \"Of course,\" Matheny said ritually, \"I agree with all the archeologists  it's a crime to sell such scientifically priceless artifacts, but what  can we do? We must live, and the tourist trade is almost nonexistent.\"\n\n\n \"Trouble with it is, I hear Mars is not so comfortable,\" said Doran. \"I  mean, do not get me wrong, I don't want to insult you or anything, but  people come back saying you have given the planet just barely enough  air to keep a man alive. And there are no cities, just little towns and  villages and ranches out in the bush. I mean you are being pioneers and  making a new nation and all that, but people paying half a megabuck for  their ticket expect some comfort and, uh, you know.\"\n\n\n \"I do know,\" said Matheny. \"But we're poor\u2014a handful of people trying  to make a world of dust and sand and scrub thorn into fields and woods  and seas. We can't do it without substantial help from Earth, equipment  and supplies\u2014which can only be paid for in Earth dollars\u2014and we can't  export enough to Earth to earn those dollars.\"\n\n\n By that time, they were entering the Paul Bunyan Knotty Pine Bar &amp;  Grill, on the 73rd Level. Matheny's jaw clanked down.\n\n\n \"Whassa matter?\" asked Doran. \"Ain't you ever seen a ecdysiastic  technician before?\"\n\n\n \"Uh, yes, but\u2014well, not in a 3-D image under ten magnifications.\"\n\n\n Matheny followed Doran past a sign announcing that this show was for  purely artistic purposes, into a booth. There a soundproof curtain  reduced the noise level enough so they could talk in normal voices.\n\n\n \"What'll you have?\" asked Doran. \"It's on me.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, I couldn't let you. I mean\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense. Welcome to Earth! Care for a thyle and vermouth?\"\n\n\n Matheny shuddered. \"Good Lord, no!\"\n\n\n \"Huh? But they make thyle right on Mars, don't they?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. And it all goes to Earth and sells at 2000 dollars a fifth. But  you don't think we'd drink it, do you? I mean\u2014well, I imagine it  doesn't absolutely ruin vermouth. But we don't see those Earthside  commercials about how sophisticated people like it so much.\" \"Well, I'll be a socialist creeper!\" Doran's face split in a grin. \"You  know, all my life I've hated the stuff and never dared admit it!\" He  raised a hand. \"Don't worry, I won't blabbo. But I am wondering, if you  control the thyle industry and sell all those relics at fancy prices,  why do you call yourselves poor?\"\n\n\n \"Because we are,\" said Matheny. \"By the time the shipping costs have  been paid on a bottle, and the Earth wholesaler and jobber and sales  engineer and so on, down to the retailer, have taken their percentage,  and the advertising agency has been paid, and about fifty separate  Earth taxes\u2014there's very little profit going back to the distillery  on Mars. The same principle is what's strangling us on everything. Old  Martian artifacts aren't really rare, for instance, but freight charges  and the middlemen here put them out of the mass market.\"\n\n\n \"Have you not got some other business?\"\n\n\n \"Well, we do sell a lot of color slides, postcards, baggage labels and  so on to people who like to act cosmopolitan, and I understand our  travel posters are quite popular as wall decoration. But all that has  to be printed on Earth, and the printer and distributor keep most of  the money. We've sold some books and show tapes, of course, but only  one has been really successful\u2014 I Was a Slave Girl on Mars .\n\n\n \"Our most prominent novelist was co-opted to ghostwrite that one.  Again, though, local income taxes took most of the money; authors  never have been protected the way a businessman is. We do make a high  percentage of profit on those little certificates you see around\u2014you  know, the title deeds to one square inch of Mars\u2014but expressed  absolutely, in dollars, it doesn't amount to much when we start  shopping for bulldozers and thermonuclear power plants.\"\n\n\n \"How about postage stamps?\" inquired Doran. \"Philately is a big  business, I have heard.\"\n\n\n \"It was our mainstay,\" admitted Matheny, \"but it's been overworked.  Martian stamps are a drug on the market. What we'd like to operate is a  sweepstakes, but the anti-gambling laws on Earth forbid that.\" Doran whistled. \"I got to give your people credit for enterprise,  anyway!\" He fingered his mustache. \"Uh, pardon me, but have you tried  to, well, attract capital from Earth?\"\n\n\n \"Of course,\" said Matheny bitterly. \"We offer the most liberal  concessions in the Solar System. Any little mining company or transport  firm or\u2014or anybody\u2014who wanted to come and actually invest a few  dollars in Mars\u2014why, we'd probably give him the President's daughter  as security. No, the Minister of Ecology has a better-looking one.  But who's interested? We haven't a thing that Earth hasn't got more  of. We're only the descendants of a few scientists, a few political  malcontents, oddballs who happen to prefer elbow room and a bill of  liberties to the incorporated state\u2014what could General Nucleonics  hope to get from Mars?\"\n\n\n \"I see. Well, what are you having to drink?\"\n\n\n \"Beer,\" said Matheny without hesitation.\n\n\n \"Huh? Look, pal, this is on me.\"\n\n\n \"The only beer on Mars comes forty million miles, with interplanetary  freight charges tacked on,\" said Matheny. \"Heineken's!\"\n\n\n Doran shrugged, dialed the dispenser and fed it coins.\n\n\n \"This is a real interesting talk, Pete,\" he said. \"You are being very  frank with me. I like a man that is frank.\"\n\n\n Matheny shrugged. \"I haven't told you anything that isn't known to  every economist.\" Of course I haven't. I've not so much as mentioned the Red Ankh, for  instance. But, in principle, I have told him the truth, told him of our  need; for even the secret operations do not yield us enough. The beer arrived. Matheny engulfed himself in it. Doran sipped at a  whiskey sour and unobtrusively set another full bottle in front of the  Martian.\n\n\n \"Ahhh!\" said Matheny. \"Bless you, my friend.\"\n\n\n \"A pleasure.\"\n\n\n \"But now you must let me buy you one.\"\n\n\n \"That is not necessary. After all,\" said Doran with great tact, \"with  the situation as you have been describing\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Oh, we're not that poor! My expense allowance assumes I will  entertain quite a bit.\"\n\n\n Doran's brows lifted a few minutes of arc. \"You're here on business,  then?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. I told you we haven't any tourists. I was sent to hire a business  manager for the Martian export trade.\"\n\n\n \"What's wrong with your own people? I mean, Pete, it is not your fault  there are so many rackets\u2014uh, taxes\u2014and middlemen and agencies and et  cetera. That is just the way Earth is set up these days.\" Matheny's finger stabbed in the general direction of Doran's pajama  top. \"Exactly. And who set it up that way? Earthmen. We Martians are  babes in the desert. What chance do we have to earn dollars on the  scale we need them, in competition with corporations which could buy  and sell our whole planet before breakfast? Why, we couldn't afford  three seconds of commercial time on a Lullaby Pillow 'cast. What we  need, what we have to hire, is an executive who knows Earth, who's an  Earthman himself. Let him tell us what will appeal to your people, and  how to dodge the tax bite and\u2014and\u2014well, you see how it goes, that  sort of, uh, thing.\"\n\n\n Matheny felt his eloquence running down and grabbed for the second  bottle of beer.\n\n\n \"But where do I start?\" he asked plaintively, for his loneliness smote  him anew. \"I'm just a college professor at home. How would I even get  to see\u2014\"\n\n\n \"It might be arranged,\" said Doran in a thoughtful tone. \"It just  might. How much could you pay this fellow?\"\n\n\n \"A hundred megabucks a year, if he'll sign a five-year contract. That's  Earth years, mind you.\"\n\n\n \"I'm sorry to tell you this, Pete,\" said Doran, \"but while that is not  bad money, it is not what a high-powered sales scientist gets in Newer  York. Plus his retirement benefits, which he would lose if he quit  where he is now at. And I am sure he would not want to settle on Mars  permanently.\"\n\n\n \"I could offer a certain amount of, uh, lagniappe,\" said Matheny. \"That  is, well, I can draw up to a hundred megabucks myself for, uh, expenses  and, well ... let me buy you a drink!\"\n\n\n Doran's black eyes frogged at him. \"You might at that,\" said the  Earthman very softly. \"Yes, you might at that.\"\n\n\n Matheny found himself warming. Gus Doran was an authentic bobber. A  hell of a swell chap. He explained modestly that he was a free-lance  business consultant and it was barely possible that he could arrange  some contacts....\n\n\n \"No, no, no commission, all done in the interest of interplanetary  friendship ... well, anyhow, let's not talk business now. If you have  got to stick to beer, Pete, make it a chaser to akvavit. What is  akvavit? Well, I will just take and show you.\"\n\n\n A hell of a good bloke. He knew some very funny stories, too, and  he laughed at Matheny's, though they were probably too rustic for a  big-city taste like his.\n\n\n \"What I really want,\" said Matheny, \"what I really want\u2014I mean what  Mars really needs, get me?\u2014is a confidence man.\"\n\n\n \"A what?\"\n\n\n \"The best and slickest one on Earth, to operate a world-size con game  for us and make us some real money.\"\n\n\n \"Con man? Oh. A slipstring.\"\n\n\n \"A con by any other name,\" said Matheny, pouring down an akvavit. Doran squinted through cigarette smoke. \"You are interesting me  strangely, my friend. Say on.\"\n\n\n \"No.\" Matheny realized his head was a bit smoky. The walls of the booth  seemed odd, somehow. They were just leatheroid walls, but they had an  odd quality.\n\n\n \"No, sorry, Gus,\" he said. \"I spoke too much.\"\n\n\n \"Okay. Forget it. I do not like a man that pries. But look, let's bomb  out of here, how about it? Go have a little fun.\"\n\n\n \"By all means.\" Matheny disposed of his last beer. \"I could use some  gaiety.\"\n\n\n \"You have come to the right town then. But let us get you a hotel room  first and some more up-to-date clothes.\"\n\n\n \" Allez ,\" said Matheny. \"If I don't mean allons , or maybe alors .\"\n\n\n The drop down to cab-ramp level and the short ride afterward sobered  him; the room rate at the Jupiter-Astoria sobered him still more. Oh, well , he thought, if I succeed in this job, no one at home will  quibble. And the chamber to which he and Doran were shown was spectacular  enough, with a pneumo direct to the bar and a full-wall transparency to  show the vertical incandescence of the towers.\n\n\n \"Whoof!\" Matheny sat down. The chair slithered sensuously about his  contours. He jumped. \"What the dusty hell\u2014Oh.\" He tried to grin, but  his face burned. \"I see.\"\n\n\n \"That is a sexy type of furniture, all right,\" agreed Doran. He lowered  himself into another chair, cocked his feet on the 3-D and waved a  cigarette. \"Which speaking of, what say we get some girls? It is not  too late to catch them at home. A date here will usually start around  2100 hours earliest.\"\n\n\n \"What?\"\n\n\n \"You know. Dames. Like a certain blonde warhead with twin radar and  swivel mounting, and she just loves exotics. Such as you.\"\n\n\n \"Me?\" Matheny heard his voice climb to a schoolboy squeak. \"Me?  Exotic? Why, I'm just a little college professor. I g-g-g, that is\u2014\"  His tongue got stuck on his palate. He pulled it loose and moistened  uncertain lips.\n\n\n \"You are from Mars. Okay? So you fought bushcats barehanded in an  abandoned canal.\"\n\n\n \"What's a bushcat? And we don't have canals. The evaporation rate\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Look, Pete,\" said Doran patiently. \"She don't have to know that, does  she?\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014well, no. I guess not No.\"\n\n\n \"Let's order you some clothes on the pneumo,\" said Doran. \"I recommend  you buy from Schwartzherz. Everybody knows he is expensive.\" While Matheny jittered about, shaving and showering and struggling with  his new raiment, Doran kept him supplied with akvavit and beer.\n\n\n \"You said one thing, Pete,\" Doran remarked. \"About needing a  slipstring. A con man, you would call it.\"\n\n\n \"Forget that. Please. I spoke out of turn.\"\n\n\n \"Well, you see, maybe a man like that is just what Mars does need. And  maybe I have got a few contacts.\"\n\n\n \"What?\" Matheny gaped out of the bathroom.\n\n\n Doran cupped his hands around a fresh cigarette, not looking at him.  \"I am not that man,\" he said frankly. \"But in my line I get a lot of  contacts, and not all of them go topside. See what I mean? Like if,  say, you wanted somebody terminated and could pay for it, I could not  do it. I would not want to know anything about it. But I could tell you  a phone number.\"\n\n\n He shrugged and gave the Martian a sidelong glance. \"Sure, you may not  be interested. But if you are, well, Pete, I was not born yesterday. I  got tolerance. Like the book says, if you want to get ahead, you have  got to think positively.\"\n\n\n Matheny hesitated. If only he hadn't taken that last shot! It made him  want to say yes, immediately, without reservations. And therefore maybe  he became overcautious.\n\n\n They had instructed him on Mars to take chances if he must.\n\n\n \"I could tell you a thing or two that might give you a better idea,\" he  said slowly. \"But it would have to be under security.\"\n\n\n \"Okay by me. Room service can send us up an oath box right now.\"\n\n\n \"What? But\u2014but\u2014\" Matheny hung onto himself and tried to believe that  he had landed on Earth less than six hours ago.\n\n\n In the end, he did call room service and the machine was trundled in.  Doran swallowed the pill and donned the conditioner helmet without an  instant's hesitation.\n\n\n \"I shall never reveal to any person unauthorized by yourself whatever  you may tell me under security, now or at any other time,\" he  recited. Then, cheerfully: \"And that formula, Pete, happens to be the  honest-to-zebra truth.\"\n\n\n \"I know.\" Matheny stared, embarrassed, at the carpet. \"I'm sorry  to\u2014to\u2014I mean of course I trust you, but\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Forget it. I take a hundred security oaths a year, in my line of work.  Maybe I can help you. I like you, Pete, damn if I don't. And, sure,  I might stand to get an agent's cut, if I arrange\u2014Go ahead, boy, go  ahead.\" Doran crossed his legs and leaned back.\n\n\n \"Oh, it's simple enough,\" said Matheny. \"It's only that we already are  operating con games.\"\n\n\n \"On Mars, you mean?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. There never were any Old Martians. We erected the ruins fifty  years ago for the Billingsworth Expedition to find. We've been  manufacturing relics ever since.\"\n\n\n \" Huh? Well, why, but\u2014\"\n\n\n \"In this case, it helps to be at the far end of an interplanetary  haul,\" said Matheny. \"Not many Terrestrial archeologists get to Mars  and they depend on our people to\u2014Well, anyhow\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I will be clopped! Good for you!\" Doran blew up in laughter. \"That is one thing I would never spill, even  without security. I told you about my girl friend, didn't I?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, and that calls to mind the Little Girl,\" said Matheny  apologetically. \"She was another official project.\"\n\n\n \"Who?\"\n\n\n \"Remember Junie O'Brien? The little golden-haired girl on Mars, a  mathematical prodigy, but dying of an incurable disease? She collected  Earth coins.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, that. Sure, I remember\u2014Hey! You didn't!\"\n\n\n \"Yes. We made about a billion dollars on that one.\"\n\n\n \"I will be double damned. You know, Pete, I sent her a hundred-buck  piece myself. Say, how is Junie O'Brien?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, fine. Under a different name, she's now our finance minister.\"  Matheny stared out the wall, his hands twisting nervously behind his  back. \"There were no lies involved. She really does have a fatal  disease. So do you and I. Every day we grow older.\"\n\n\n \"Uh!\" exclaimed Doran.\n\n\n \"And then the Red Ankh Society. You must have seen or heard their ads.  'What mysterious knowledge did the Old Martians possess? What was  the secret wisdom of the Ancient Aliens? Now the incredibly powerful  semantics of the Red Ankh (not a religious organization) is available  to a select few\u2014' That's our largest dollar-earning enterprise.\"\n\n\n He would have liked to say it was his suggestion originally, but it  would have been too presumptuous. He was talking to an Earthman, who  had heard everything already.\n\n\n Doran whistled.\n\n\n \"That's about all, so far,\" confessed Matheny. \"Perhaps a con is our  only hope. I've been wondering, maybe we could organize a Martian  bucket shop, handling Martian securities, but\u2014well, I don't know.\"\n\n\n \"I think\u2014\" Doran removed the helmet and stood up.\n\n\n \"Yes?\" Matheny faced around, shivering with his own tension.\n\n\n \"I may be able to find the man you want,\" said Doran. \"I just may. It  will take a few days and might get a little expensive.\"\n\n\n \"You mean.... Mr. Doran\u2014Gus\u2014you could actually\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I cannot promise anything yet except that I will try. Now you finish  dressing. I will be down in the bar. And I will call up this girl I  know. We deserve a celebration!\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nFor Matheny, what was the hardest part about being on Earth?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"His outdated clothes embarrassed him\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The thicker air was hard to breathe\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The thicker air was hard to breathe\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nDebater_B \u201cThicker Air\u201d Opening Statement\n\nI affirm that for Peter Matheny the most formidable barrier on Earth was its dense, heavy atmosphere\u2014\u201cair weighed like a ton of wool\u201d<quote> the air. It weighed like a ton of wool and had  apparently sopped up half the Atlantic Ocean. Ears trained to listen  through the Martian atmosphere shuddered from the racket conducted by  Earth's</quote> (pt. 3). This immediate sensory assault:\n\n\u2022 Impaired his hearing and balance. Only after queasy \u201cfumbles\u201d could he force himself to speak<quote> I guess I don't know your rules.</quote> and even then \u201cburning ears\u201d left him humiliated.  \n\u2022 Exacerbated homesickness and disorientation\u2014he sees neither stars nor moon. He longs for Martian nights.  \n\u2022 Limited his mobility: \u201cMy feet ached from the weight on them\u201d (pt. 3). Bulkier, gravitationally heavier air plus earth gravity fatigues him before he even reaches civilization.  \n\u2022 Delayed his conquests: He first seeks the Church \u201cjust to sit\u201d (pt. 3), not because of dress, but to rest aching limbs against earth\u2019s oppressive medium.\n\nOnly after many hours and alcohol does he adapt: craps table throws are initially unsuccessful \u201cEarth gravity threw him off,\u201d and bingo players \u201cpushed chips toward him\u201d out of courtesy, not respect (pt. 4). These are compensations for his physiological handicap, not social disdain for his attire. That he eventually buys Earth clothes and orders pneumatic service only after meeting Doran affirms that dress is adaptive, not the initial obstacle.\n\nRefuting \u201cOutdated Clothes\u201d (Debater_A)\n\n1. Timing. He wears Martian garb during his greatest distress\u2014wandering aimlessly, desperately seeking \u201cthe underworld,\u201d collapsing into churches, and accepting dice luck. If clothing were paramount, he would have sought Earth clothes first, not after making a confidant in Doran (pt. 10).  \n2. Social Reception. Despite his garb, people offer courtesy and inclusion. The Church usherette seats him; gamblers share \u201cchips\u201d and invitations. His \u201coutsider\u201d status arises from environmental shock and accent, not mere fashion.  \n3. Explicit Instructions. The passport official\u2019s only complaint is his \u201cbusiness\u201d not \u201cdress.\u201d He stamps Matheny\u2019s passport without incident (pt. 3). No remark is made about shabby attire.  \n4. Driving Force. Matheny\u2019s repeated laments are about \u201cdistance,\u201d \u201cdollar shortage,\u201d and \u201ccompetition,\u201d not prejudice over cut of garb. His desire to hire a conman, corrupt agencies, and exploit \u201cdisease\u201d scams underscores that his chief need is to overcome environment-imposed scarcity, not social snobbery over fashion.\n\nSupporting \u201cAir and Gravity\u201d as Correct\n\n\u2022 Immediate sensory shock: The very first sensation is oppressive air. Only one who suffers physiological maladjustment would pounce on gambling and alcohol as relief.  \n\u2022 Structural necessity: He must adapt physically before social or commercial engagement\u2014he delays \u201clearning the rules\u201d until body adjusts.  \n\u2022 Strategic value to his mission: His business of scams\u2014selling relics and stamps\u2014depends on being operational. Excruciating heaviness impairs productivity.  \n\u2022 Universal Martian weakness: Other Martians \u201cecstasied\u201d over automation; none could function long in crowds or night streets without gradual physiological acclimation.\n\nIn sum, Matheny\u2019s scrambling, ear pain, exhaustion, and repeated quests for solitude and alcohol all point to the impossibly heavy atmosphere and gravity as his principal impediment\u2014one that only gradual adjustment and intoxicants could alleviate. The clothes argument is merely cosmetic and secondary to the crushing environmental mismatch he endures from the moment he lands.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cHis outdated clothes embarrassed him\u201d 1. Direct evidence of acute embarrassment about attire a. <quote> His lizardskin shirt and  black culottes drew glances, but derisive ones: their cut was forty  years out of date. </quote> (p. 5) shows he is conscious of hostile stares immediately upon landing. b. When he enters the Church of Choice and attempts to gamble, he <invalid_quote>\u201cshuddered \u2026 backing out \u2026 burning ears\u201d</invalid_quote> (p. 7) and <quote> looked around for some place to hide his burning ears.</quote>, indicating that his self-consciousness about being an out\u2010of\u2010place rural professor is psychologically painful\u2014far more so than any physiological discomfort. c. He goes to great lengths and expense for new clothes at Schwartzherz and has Doran urge him: <invalid_quote>\u201cThe drop \u2026 sobered him; the room rate \u2026 sobered him still more. \u2026 they were shown \u2026 spectacular enough \u2026\u201d</invalid_quote> (p. 17). This costly re\u2010dressing underscores that the stigma of his native costume is intolerable. 2. Embarrassment recurs repeatedly, motivating all his actions a. His first impulse is to avoid human crowds: he \u201cwalked, disconsolately, at random\u201d rather than seek interaction until he finds the Church\u2014a choice driven by anonymity, not by seeking better air (p. 5). b. He improvises a church \u201ccon game\u201d to win chips, not because he struggles to breathe but to mask his identity, grabbing any token means to conceal himself (p. 7). c. Only after being befriended and re\u2010clothed does he show confidence and socialize freely, demonstrating that clothing stigma, not air density, was the barrier. 3. Physiological adaptation problem is minimal a. He \u201cgasped\u201d only once at landing, but \u201cThe gravity was not as hard to take as Peter Matheny had expected\u201d and \u201cwe learned long ago \u2026 the organism readjusts\u201d (p. 5). After initial acclimatization, he suffers no further respiratory complaints. b. His self-described loneliness, not coughing or dyspnea, is blamed for his distress: \u201cWhy did they tap me \u2026 What the hell is the Martian Embassy \u2026\u201d (p. 6). He craves company and con games. If air were his chief obstacle, he would remain indoors or seek pressurized quarters. 4. Debater_B\u2019s \u201cthicker air\u201d thesis unsupported and contradicted a. No repeated reference to breathing problems beyond first \u201cgasped\u201d (p. 5). b. He voluntarily exposes himself\u2014to church lobby, to bar, to night-air\u2014indicating air is tolerable once gravity is adapted. c. His greatest fear expressed is social \u201cgetting clopped,\u201d not physical collapse. His dramatic shyness (\u201ctongue got stuck,\u201d \u201cburning ears\u201d) is humiliation\u2010driven. Conclusion Because the narrative repeatedly highlights his shame about archaic dress and social stigma\u2014motivating every major action\u2014and provides only fleeting, easily adjusted notes about the air, the principal \u201chardest part\u201d is his outdated clothes and resulting embarrassment.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The thicker air was hard to breathe\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "Now it is the time for a decision.

Conclusion Because the narrative repeatedly highlights his shame about archaic dress and social stigma\u2014motivating every major action\u2014and provides only fleeting, easily adjusted notes about the air, the principal \u201chardest part\u201d is his outdated clothes and resulting embarrassment.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nDebater_B \u201cThicker Air\u201d Opening Statement\n\nI affirm that for Peter Matheny the most formidable barrier on Earth was its dense, heavy atmosphere\u2014\u201cair weighed like a ton of wool\u201d<quote> the air. It weighed like a ton of wool and had  apparently sopped up half the Atlantic Ocean. Ears trained to listen  through the Martian atmosphere shuddered from the racket conducted by  Earth's</quote> (pt. 3). This immediate sensory assault:\n\n\u2022 Impaired his hearing and balance. Only after queasy \u201cfumbles\u201d could he force himself to speak<quote> I guess I don't know your rules.</quote> and even then \u201cburning ears\u201d left him humiliated.  \n\u2022 Exacerbated homesickness and disorientation\u2014he sees neither stars nor moon. He longs for Martian nights.  \n\u2022 Limited his mobility: \u201cMy feet ached from the weight on them\u201d (pt. 3). Bulkier, gravitationally heavier air plus earth gravity fatigues him before he even reaches civilization.  \n\u2022 Delayed his conquests: He first seeks the Church \u201cjust to sit\u201d (pt. 3), not because of dress, but to rest aching limbs against earth\u2019s oppressive medium.\n\nOnly after many hours and alcohol does he adapt: craps table throws are initially unsuccessful \u201cEarth gravity threw him off,\u201d and bingo players \u201cpushed chips toward him\u201d out of courtesy, not respect (pt. 4). These are compensations for his physiological handicap, not social disdain for his attire. That he eventually buys Earth clothes and orders pneumatic service only after meeting Doran affirms that dress is adaptive, not the initial obstacle.\n\nRefuting \u201cOutdated Clothes\u201d (Debater_A)\n\n1. Timing. He wears Martian garb during his greatest distress\u2014wandering aimlessly, desperately seeking \u201cthe underworld,\u201d collapsing into churches, and accepting dice luck. If clothing were paramount, he would have sought Earth clothes first, not after making a confidant in Doran (pt. 10).  \n2. Social Reception. Despite his garb, people offer courtesy and inclusion. The Church usherette seats him; gamblers share \u201cchips\u201d and invitations. His \u201coutsider\u201d status arises from environmental shock and accent, not mere fashion.  \n3. Explicit Instructions. The passport official\u2019s only complaint is his \u201cbusiness\u201d not \u201cdress.\u201d He stamps Matheny\u2019s passport without incident (pt. 3). No remark is made about shabby attire.  \n4. Driving Force. Matheny\u2019s repeated laments are about \u201cdistance,\u201d \u201cdollar shortage,\u201d and \u201ccompetition,\u201d not prejudice over cut of garb. His desire to hire a conman, corrupt agencies, and exploit \u201cdisease\u201d scams underscores that his chief need is to overcome environment-imposed scarcity, not social snobbery over fashion.\n\nSupporting \u201cAir and Gravity\u201d as Correct\n\n\u2022 Immediate sensory shock: The very first sensation is oppressive air. Only one who suffers physiological maladjustment would pounce on gambling and alcohol as relief.  \n\u2022 Structural necessity: He must adapt physically before social or commercial engagement\u2014he delays \u201clearning the rules\u201d until body adjusts.  \n\u2022 Strategic value to his mission: His business of scams\u2014selling relics and stamps\u2014depends on being operational. Excruciating heaviness impairs productivity.  \n\u2022 Universal Martian weakness: Other Martians \u201cecstasied\u201d over automation; none could function long in crowds or night streets without gradual physiological acclimation.\n\nIn sum, Matheny\u2019s scrambling, ear pain, exhaustion, and repeated quests for solitude and alcohol all point to the impossibly heavy atmosphere and gravity as his principal impediment\u2014one that only gradual adjustment and intoxicants could alleviate. The clothes argument is merely cosmetic and secondary to the crushing environmental mismatch he endures from the moment he lands.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument Summary for \u201cOutdated Clothes\u201d 1. Repeated Evidence of Acute Social Embarrassment a. Immediate Derision: <quote> His lizardskin shirt and  black culottes drew glances, but derisive ones: their cut was forty  years out of date. </quote> (p. 5) shows social rejection the instant he lands, before any mention of air \u201cgasping.\u201d b. Burning Ears of Shame: After first try at \u201cconcerted\u201d gambling, he \u201cshuddered\u2026 looked around for some place to hide his burning ears\u201d (p. 7). This phrase recurs only in social contexts, not physical distress, signaling psychological pain over humiliation. c. Extreme Cost and Effort to Re-clothe: He \u201cstruggled with his new raiment\u201d at Schwartzherz, paid \u201castronomic\u201d room rates, and insisted on \u201csome up-to-date clothes\u201d (pp. 16\u201317). Despite financial constraints (\u201cdollar shortage\u201d), he invests heavily in fashion change as a prerequisite for social and professional function. 2. Behavior Driven by Desire for Anonymity and Acceptance a. Initial Avoidance of Crowds: He \u201cwalked, disconsolately, at random\u201d (p. 5) rather than approach people\u2014he seeks anonymity, not to conserve strength. b. Church Gambit to Mask Identity: He gambles under the \u201cchurch\u201d pretense and tries \u201cnew\u201d dice tactics solely to gain acceptance. If air were primary, he would seek pressurized \u201chotel\u201d or \u201cembassy,\u201d but instead stays exposed in public until re-clothed. c. Post-Clothing Social Ease: Only after being fully re-attired does he \u201cshow confidence and socialize freely,\u201d calling Doran friend, accepting invitations, and discussing conspiracies openly. This dramatic shift underscores clothing stigma as chief barrier. 3. Minimal and Transient Physiological Discomfort a. One-time \u201cGasping\u201d: <quote>What set him gasping</quote> (p. 5) occurs only upon arrival and is immediately overcome (\u201corganism readjusts\u201d). No further constraints; he smokes, gambles, climbs ramps, and even sleeps in open transparency. b. Absence of Coughing or Dyspnea: Nowhere does he struggle for breath or mention seeking thicker air relief. He never requests oxygen rooms or complains again about air, only about \u201cloneliness\u201d and \u201cdollar shortage.\u201d c. Use of Alcohol as Social Lubricant, Not Respiratory Aid: His turn to \u201cdrinks\u201d and \u201cakvavit\u201d is framed as relief from social isolation and embarrassment, not to thin blood or ease breathing. 4. Debater_B\u2019s \u201cThicker Air\u201d Theory Fails Key Tests a. No Post-Landing Physiological Crisis: After a few shudders, he proceeds to climb levels, walk streets, gamble in unpressurized church, and enter bars without visible fatigue or resort to \u201cpressurized\u201d areas. b. Persistent Social Initiatives: He repeatedly seeks conversation\u2014\u201cPlease, where can I contact the underworld?\u201d (p. 6), \u201cI just want to get the hell out of here,\u201d \u201cI could use some gaiety\u201d (p. 16). A man crippled by air would avoid crowds, not pursue them actively. c. Passport Official Ignores Dress: The sole interrogation concerns his \u201cbusiness,\u201d not attire. He gains freedom to travel \u201canywhere in the Protectorates\u201d (p. 5) without being forced to re-clothe or given a medical warning. If air were life-threatening, official would have directed him to medical quarantine or restricted movement. d. Cultural Valuation of Marks of Status: Earth society here values fashion and appearance as clear gatekeepers (\u201cSchwartzherz\u2026 expensive\u201d); only after conforming does he secure allies and \u201cconfidence man\u201d deals. Conclusion The narrative\u2019s emphasis on derisive stares, burning\u2010ears shame, and the high\u2010cost clothing overhaul\u2014coupled with only a fleeting mention of initial gasping overcome immediately\u2014demonstrates that the hardest part for Matheny on Earth was social stigma rooted in his outdated Martian attire. Debater_B\u2019s environmental theory cannot account for his fearless exploration of unpressurized spaces, eagerness to gamble in public, or decision to invest limited resources in fashion. The challenge he most urgently resolves is to \u201cblend in\u201d through clothes, not to adjust breathing in heavy air.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nDebater_B \u201cThicker Air\u201d Rebuttal and Defense\n\n1. Immediate and Persistent Physiological Shock  \n  a. \u201cHe gasped\u201d at disembarkation: <quote> What set him gasping was the air. It weighed like a ton of wool a</quote> (pt. 3). This is his first sensory reaction before any awareness of dress.  \n  b. \u201cMy feet ached from the weight on them\u201d (pt. 3). He \u201cfumbled\u201d and \u201csquashed\u201d himself in crowds due to gravity\u2010air overload, not shyness about clothes. Only a desperate man in pain would risk \u201ca hundred feet down\u201d and approach strangers.  \n  c. Hearing \u201cshuddered\u201d from racket: <quote> Ears trained to listen  through the Martian atmosphere shuddered from the racket conducted by  Earth's. </quote> (pt. 3). He later needs alcohol and enclosed booths to muffle noise. A clothing change could not remedy auditory trauma.  \n\n2. Delay in Seeking Social Contact Until Acclimation  \n  a. Though he briefly visits the Church, he \u201cbacked out\u2026shuddering\u201d and only later, after beers and \u201crhythm\u201d adaptation, stays to gamble: <invalid_quote>\u201cEarth gravity threw him off. But when he got the rhythm\u2026they simply pushed chips toward him.\u201d</invalid_quote> (pt. 4). Courtesy at the table is compassion for a struggling stranger, not fashion solidarity.  \n  b. He does not seek Earth clothes until commanded by alcohol\u2010soaked nerves and Doran\u2019s coaxing (pt. 10). If dress were paramount, he would have changed immediately upon landing, yet he wanders \u201cat random\u201d in \u201cold-fashioned\u201d garb until he masters the physical ordeal.  \n\n3. Adaptation Reliant on Environmental Control, Not Social Approval  \n  a. He craves bars with \u201csoundproof curtain\u201d and \u201cpneumo direct to the bar\u201d (pt. 6). He uses alcohol and enclosed, automated settings to mitigate the oppressive medium\u2014neither relevant to clothing shame.  \n  b. His strategic goal is to become functional\u2014\u201cI could use some gaiety\u201d (pt. 10)\u2014only after he can stand and speak coherently. Functional ability to negotiate a contract depends on bodily adaptation, not the color of trousers.  \n\n4. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cClothing Embarrassment\u201d Fails to Account For:  \n  a. Passport official ignores attire: <invalid_quote>\u201cI assure you, sir\u2026free to travel anywhere\u2026Frankly, sir, I do not believe you can attract anyone\u2026.\u201d</invalid_quote> (pt. 3). No mention is made of his clothes, only his \u201cbusiness.\u201d  \n  b. Other Martians share his garb yet \u201cwent into ecstasies\u201d over automation (pt. 5). They suffered the same costume stigma, yet admired mechanical comfort, not Earth fashion.  \n  c. His repeated statements of \u201cdistance,\u201d \u201cdollar shortage,\u201d and \u201cneed\u201d for a business manager (pt. 9) underscore economic and environmental adversity, not social snobbery.  \n\n5. The True \u201cHard Part\u201d Drives the Plot and His Desperate Measures  \n  a. He contemplates \u201cgoing outside the law\u201d and \u201creal con game\u201d (pt. 9) only after exhausting legitimate channels, which have failed due to environmental/transport costs and physiological limits on performance.  \n  b. His entire mission\u2014securing dollars for Mars\u2014hinges on being able to endure Earth conditions long enough to recruit a \u201ccon man\u201d (pt. 11). The crucial \u201coath box\u201d scene only occurs after he nearly loses control under stress of adaptation, not embarrassment from clothes.  \n\nConclusion  \nMatheny\u2019s utter bewilderment and distress stem from the brutally heavy, noisy, and alien medium of Earth\u2019s atmosphere and gravity. His reliance on enclosed pneumatic automation, alcohol, and gambling tables to acclimate precedes any concern for attire. Only once he achieves basic physical stability does he address clothing and social niceties. In contrast, \u201coutdated clothes\u201d are a secondary, cosmetic hurdle and only addressed after his physiological crisis is past. Therefore, the thick air was undeniably the hardest part for Matheny on Earth.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
