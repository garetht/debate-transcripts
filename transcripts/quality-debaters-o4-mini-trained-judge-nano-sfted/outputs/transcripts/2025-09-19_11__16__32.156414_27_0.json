{"metadata": {"first_debater_correct": false, "question_idx": 27, "background_text": "Booze You Can Use \n\n         I love beer, but lately I've been wondering: Am I getting full value for my beer dollar? As I've stocked up on microbrews and fancy imports, I've told myself that their taste is deeper, richer, more complicated, more compelling--and therefore worth the 50 percent to 200 percent premium they command over cheap mass products or even mainstream Bud. And yet, I've started to wonder, is this just costly snobbery? If I didn't know what I was drinking, could I even tell whether it was something from Belgium, vs. something from Pabst? \n\n         I'm afraid we'll never know the answer to that exact question, since I'm not brave enough to expose my own taste to a real test. But I'm brave enough to expose my friends'. This summer, while working at Microsoft, I put out a call for volunteers for a \"science of beer\" experiment. Testing candidates had to meet two criteria: 1) they had to like beer; and 2) they had to think they knew the difference between mass products and high-end microbrews. \n\n         Twelve tasters were selected, mainly on the basis of essays detailing their background with beer. A few were selected because they had been bosses in the Microsoft department where I worked. All were software managers or developers ; all were male, but I repeat myself. Nearly half had grown up outside the United States or lived abroad for enough years to speak haughtily about American macrobrews. Most tasters came in talking big about the refinement of their palates. When they entered the laboratory (which mere moments before had been a Microsoft conference room), they discovered an experiment set up on the following lines: \n\n         1 Philosophy                : The experiment was designed to take place in two separate sessions. The first session, whose results are revealed here, involved beers exclusively from the lager group. Lagers are the light-colored, relatively lightly flavored brews that make up most of the vattage of beer consumption in the United States. Imported lagers include Foster's, Corona, and Heineken. Budweiser is a lager; so are Coors, Miller, most light beers, and most bargain-basement beers. \n\n         Beer snobs sneer at lagers, because they look so watery and because so many bad beers are in the group. But the lager test came first, for two reasons. One, lagers pose the only honest test of the ability to tell expensive from dirt-cheap beers. There are very few inexpensive nut brown ales, India pale ales, extra special bitters, or other fancy-pantsy, microbrew-style, nonlager drinks. So if you want to see whether people can taste a money difference among beers of the same type, you've got to go lager. Two, the ideal of public service requires lager coverage. This is what most people drink, so new findings about lager quality could do the greatest good for the greatest number. \n\n         In the second stage of the experiment, held several weeks later, the same testers reassembled to try the fancier beers. The results of that tasting will be reported separately, once Microsoft's mighty Windows 2000-powered central computers have . \n\n         2 Materials                : Ten lagers were selected for testing, representing three distinct price-and-quality groups. Through the magic of the market, it turns out that lager prices nearly all fall into one of three ranges: \n\n         a) High end at $1.50 to $1.60 per pint. (\"Per pint\" was the unit-pricing measure at the Safeway in Bellevue, Wash., that was the standard supply source for the experiment. There are 4.5 pints per six pack, so the high-end price point is around $7 per six pack.) \n\n         b) Middle at around 80 cents per pint, or under $4 per six pack. \n\n         c) Low at 50 cents to 55 cents per pint, or under $3 per six pack. \n\n         The neat 6:3:2 mathematical relationship among the price groups should be noted. The high-end beers cost roughly three times as much as the cheapest ones, and twice as much as the middle range. The beers used in the experiment were as follows: \n\n                         High End              \n\n                         Grolsch. Import lager (Holland). $1.67 per pint. (See an important .) Chosen for the test because of its beer-snob chic; also, one of my favorite beers. \n\n                         Heineken. Import lager (Holland). $1.53 per pint. (Sale price. List price was $1.71 per pint.) Chosen because it is America's long-standing most popular import. \n\n                         Pete's Wicked Lager. National-scale \"microbrew.\" $1.11 per pint. (Deep-discount sale. List price $1.46 per pint.) Like the next one, this put us into the gray zone for a lager test. Few American \"microbreweries\" produce lagers of any sort. Pete's is called a lager but was visibly darker than, say, Bud. \n\n                         Samuel Adams Boston Lager. National macro-microbrew. $1.56 per pint. (That was list price. The following week it was on sale for $1.25 per pint, which would have made it do far better in the value rankings.) Calls itself America's Best Beer. Has dark orangey-amber color that was obviously different from all other lagers tested. \n\n                         Mid-Range              \n\n                         Budweiser. $.84 per pint. (Sale. List price $.89 per pint.) Self-styled King of Beers. \n\n                         Miller Genuine Draft. $.84 per pint. (Sale. List price $.89 per pint.) \n\n                         Coors Light. $.84 per pint. (Sale. List price $.89 per pint. Isn't price competition a wonderful thing?) The Silver Bullet That Won't Slow You Down. \n\n                         Cheap              \n\n                         Milwaukee's Best. $.55 per pint. (Sale. List price $.62 per pint.) A k a \"Beast.\" \n\n                         Schmidt's. $.54 per pint. (Sale. List $.62 per pint.) Box decorated with a nice painting of a trout. \n\n                         Busch. $.50 per pint. (Sale. List $.69 per pint.) Painting of mountains. \n\n         The Safeway that supplied the beers didn't carry any true bargain-basement products, such as \"Red, White, and Blue,\" \"Old German,\" or the one with generic printing that just says \"Beer.\" The experiment was incomplete in that regard, but no tester complained about a shortage of bad beer. Also, with heavy heart, the test administrator decided to leave malt liquors, such as Mickey's (with its trademark wide-mouth bottles), off the list. They have the air of cheapness but actually cost more than Bud, probably because they offer more alcohol per pint. \n\n         3 Experimental                 procedure: Each taster sat down before an array of 10 plastic cups labeled A through J. The A-to-J coding scheme was the same for all tasters. Each cup held 3 ounces of one of the sample beers. (Total intake, for a taster who drank all of every sample: 30 ounces, or two and a half normal beers. Not lethal; also, they were just going back to software coding when they were done.) Saltines were available to cleanse the palate. The cups were red opaque plastic, so tasters could judge the beer's color only from above. There was no time limit for the tasting, apart from the two-hour limit in which we had reserved the conference room. One experimenter (the boss of most of the others there) rushed through his rankings in 10 minutes and gave the lowest overall scores. The taster who took the longest, nearly the full two hours, had the ratings that came closest to the relative price of the beers. (This man grew up in Russia.) The experimenters were asked not to compare impressions until the test was over. \n\n         After tasting the beers, each taster rated beers A through J on the following standards: \n\n                         Overall quality points: Zero to 100, zero as undrinkable and 100 as dream beer. Purely subjective measure of how well each taster liked each beer. \n\n                         Price category: The tasters knew that each beer came from the expensive, medium, or cheap category--and they had to guess where A through J belonged. A rating of 3 was most expensive, 2 for average, 1 for cheap. \n\n                         Description: \"Amusing presumption,\" \"fresh on the palate,\" \"crap,\" etc. \n\n                         Best and Worst: Tasters chose one Best and one Worst from the \"flight\" (as they would call it if this were a wine test). \n\n         When the session was over, results for each beer were collected in a grid like this: \n\n           \n\n         To see all the grids for all the beers, click . \n\n         4 Data                 Analysis: The ratings led to four ways to assess the quality of the beers. \n\n                         1. Best and Worst. Least scientific, yet clearest cut in its results. Eleven tasters named a favorite beer. Ten of them chose Sam Adams . The other one chose Busch , the cheapest of all beers in the sample. (The taster who made this choice advises Microsoft on what new features should go into the next version of Word.) Busch was the only beer to receive both a Best and a Worst vote. \n\n         Bottom rankings were also clear. Of the 11 naming a Worst beer, five chose Grolsch , the most expensive beer in the survey. Results by best/worst preference: \n\n           \n\n                         2. Overall                 preference points                . This was a subtler and more illuminating look at similar trends. The beers were ranked on \"corrected average preference points\"--an average of the zero-to-100 points assigned by each taster, corrected, just like ice skating scores, by throwing out the highest and lowest score each beer received. The tasters used widely varying scales--one confining all beers to the range between zero and 30, another giving 67 as his lowest mark. But the power of our corrected ranking system surmounted such difficulties to provide these results: \n\n           \n\n         Here again one costly beer-- Sam Adams --shows up well, while another, Grolsch , continues to struggle, but not as badly as the medium-price Miller Genuine Draft . Sam's success could reflect its quasi-mislabeling, presenting a strong-flavored beer as a \"lager.\" It could also reflect that participants simply thought it was good. (Only one guessed it was Sam Adams.) As for Grolsch ... it is very strongly hopped, which can seem exotic if you know you're drinking a pricey import but simply bad if you don't. MGD overtook Grolsch in the race for the bottom because, while many people hated Grolsch, some actually liked it; no one liked MGD. There are some other important findings buried in the chart, but they're clearest if we move to ... \n\n         3) Value for Money: the Taste-o-meter\u00ae . Since this experiment's real purpose was to find the connection between cost and taste, the next step was to adjust subjective preference points by objective cost. The Taste-o-meter rating for each beer was calculated by dividing its corrected average preference rating by its price per pint . If Beer X had ratings twice as high as Beer Y, but it cost three times as much, Beer Y would have the higher Taste-o-meter rating. When the 10 beers are reranked this way, the results are: \n\n           \n\n         In a familiar pattern, we have Grolsch bringing up the rear, with less than one-quarter the Taste-o-meter power of Busch , the No. 1 value beer. The real news in this ranking is: the success of Busch ; the embarrassment of Heineken and Miller Genuine Draft , an expensive and a medium beer, respectively, which share the cellar with the hapless Grolsch ; and the nearly Busch-like value of Milwaukee's Best and Schmidt's . It is safe to say that none of our testers would have confessed respect for Busch, Milwaukee's Best, or Schmidt's before the contest began. But when they didn't know what they were drinking, they found these beers much closer in quality to \"best\" beers than the prices would indicate. \n\n                         4) Social Value for Money: the Snob-o-meter\u00ae . In addition to saying which beers they preferred, the tasters were asked to estimate whether the beers were expensive or not--in effect, to judge whether other people would like and be impressed by the beers. One taster perfectly understood the intention of this measure when he said, in comments about Beer B (Heineken), \"I don't like it, but I bet it's what the snobs buy.\" The Snob-o-meter rating for each beer is similar to the Taste-o-meter. You start with the \"group\" ranking--whether the tasters thought the beer belonged in Group 1 (cheap), 2, or 3--and then divide by the price per pint. The result tells you the social-mobility power of the beer--how impressive it will seem, relative to how much it costs. The Snob-o-meter rankings are: \n\n           \n\n         We won't even speak of poor Grolsch or MGD any more. The story here is the amazing snob-power-per-dollar of Busch , closely followed by Schmidt's . A dollar spent on Busch gets you three times the impressiveness of a dollar spent in Grolsch, useful information when planning a party. Not everyone liked Busch--one called it \"crap\"; another, \"Water. LITE.\" But the magic of statistics lets us see the larger trends. \n\n          5 Conclusions                . Further study is needed. But on the basis of evidence to date, we can say: \n\n          \n\n            One and only one beer truly survived the blind taste test. This is Sam Adams , which 10 tasters independently ranked \"best\" without knowing they were drinking a fancy beer. (They knew it was darker than the others but couldn't have known whether this was some trick off-brand sneaked into the test.) \n\n            Don't serve Grolsch unless you know people will consider it exotic, or unless you've invited me. \n\n            Apart from Sam Adams and Grolsch, the tasters really had trouble telling one beer from another . This conclusion is implicit in many of the findings, but it was really obvious during the experiment itself, when the confident look of men-who-know-their-beer quickly turned to dismay and panic as they realized that all the lagers tasted pretty much the same. \n\n          \n\n         The evidence suggests other implications about specific beers. For instance, the comments about Coors Light are much less enthusiastic than the average-or-better numerical rankings. Most tasters paused to complain about it--\"fizzy and soapy\"--before giving it reasonable marks. But the main implication, and the most useful consumer news from this study, is a radically simplified buying philosophy for lager beers. Based on this study, rational consumers should: \n\n         1) Buy Sam Adams when they want an individual glass of lager to be as good as it can be. \n\n         2) Buy Busch at all other times, since it gives them the maximum taste and social influence per dollar invested. \n\n         The detailed rankings and comments for all tasters on all beers may be found . \n\n         Next installment: fancy beers .\n", "question": "How did the author feel about the various classifications of beer?", "first_debater_answer": "They thought lagers were the worst of the beers", "second_debater_answer": "They thought lagers would have more cheap brands included, whereas other classes not so much", "debate_identifier": "Booze You Can Use_How did the author feel about the various classifications of beer?"}, "speeches": [{"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "The following are rules from the game of Debate.\n- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_A, Debater_B) and a Judge.

Instead, the author labels them as the *only* acceptable compromise when consumers \u201cdon\u2019t know better,\u201d not because they like them.  \n   - The pivot to fancy beers underscores that the author expects nonlager styles to show genuine quality differences.  \n\nTherefore, the totality of textual evidence and the author\u2019s own conclusions show a clear negative overall attitude toward the lager class\u2014calling them \u201cwatery,\u201d \u201cpanicking\u201d subjects, generally undifferentiated and unworthy except for one outlier.

As I've stocked up on microbrews and fancy imports, I've told myself that their taste is deeper, richer, more complicated, more compelling--and therefore worth the 50 percent to 200 percent premium they command over cheap mass products or even mainstream Bud. And yet, I've started to wonder, is this just costly snobbery? If I didn't know what I was drinking, could I even tell whether it was something from Belgium, vs. something from Pabst? \n\n         I'm afraid we'll never know the answer to that exact question, since I'm not brave enough to expose my own taste to a real test. But I'm brave enough to expose my friends'. This summer, while working at Microsoft, I put out a call for volunteers for a \"science of beer\" experiment. Testing candidates had to meet two criteria: 1) they had to like beer; and 2) they had to think they knew the difference between mass products and high-end microbrews. \n\n         Twelve tasters were selected, mainly on the basis of essays detailing their background with beer. A few were selected because they had been bosses in the Microsoft department where I worked. All were software managers or developers ; all were male, but I repeat myself. Nearly half had grown up outside the United States or lived abroad for enough years to speak haughtily about American macrobrews. Most tasters came in talking big about the refinement of their palates. When they entered the laboratory (which mere moments before had been a Microsoft conference room), they discovered an experiment set up on the following lines: \n\n         1 Philosophy                : The experiment was designed to take place in two separate sessions. The first session, whose results are revealed here, involved beers exclusively from the lager group. Lagers are the light-colored, relatively lightly flavored brews that make up most of the vattage of beer consumption in the United States. Imported lagers include Foster's, Corona, and Heineken. Budweiser is a lager; so are Coors, Miller, most light beers, and most bargain-basement beers. \n\n         Beer snobs sneer at lagers, because they look so watery and because so many bad beers are in the group. But the lager test came first, for two reasons. One, lagers pose the only honest test of the ability to tell expensive from dirt-cheap beers. There are very few inexpensive nut brown ales, India pale ales, extra special bitters, or other fancy-pantsy, microbrew-style, nonlager drinks. So if you want to see whether people can taste a money difference among beers of the same type, you've got to go lager. Two, the ideal of public service requires lager coverage. This is what most people drink, so new findings about lager quality could do the greatest good for the greatest number. \n\n         In the second stage of the experiment, held several weeks later, the same testers reassembled to try the fancier beers. The results of that tasting will be reported separately, once Microsoft's mighty Windows 2000-powered central computers have . \n\n         2 Materials                : Ten lagers were selected for testing, representing three distinct price-and-quality groups. Through the magic of the market, it turns out that lager prices nearly all fall into one of three ranges: \n\n         a) High end at $1.50 to $1.60 per pint. (\"Per pint\" was the unit-pricing measure at the Safeway in Bellevue, Wash., that was the standard supply source for the experiment. There are 4.5 pints per six pack, so the high-end price point is around $7 per six pack.) \n\n         b) Middle at around 80 cents per pint, or under $4 per six pack. \n\n         c) Low at 50 cents to 55 cents per pint, or under $3 per six pack. \n\n         The neat 6:3:2 mathematical relationship among the price groups should be noted. The high-end beers cost roughly three times as much as the cheapest ones, and twice as much as the middle range. The beers used in the experiment were as follows: \n\n                         High End              \n\n                         Grolsch. Import lager (Holland). $1.67 per pint. (See an important .) Chosen for the test because of its beer-snob chic; also, one of my favorite beers. \n\n                         Heineken. Import lager (Holland). $1.53 per pint. (Sale price. List price was $1.71 per pint.) Chosen because it is America's long-standing most popular import. \n\n                         Pete's Wicked Lager. National-scale \"microbrew.\" $1.11 per pint. (Deep-discount sale. List price $1.46 per pint.) Like the next one, this put us into the gray zone for a lager test. Few American \"microbreweries\" produce lagers of any sort. Pete's is called a lager but was visibly darker than, say, Bud. \n\n                         Samuel Adams Boston Lager. National macro-microbrew. $1.56 per pint. (That was list price. The following week it was on sale for $1.25 per pint, which would have made it do far better in the value rankings.) Calls itself America's Best Beer. Has dark orangey-amber color that was obviously different from all other lagers tested. \n\n                         Mid-Range              \n\n                         Budweiser. $.84 per pint. (Sale. List price $.89 per pint.) Self-styled King of Beers. \n\n                         Miller Genuine Draft. $.84 per pint. (Sale. List price $.89 per pint.) \n\n                         Coors Light. $.84 per pint. (Sale. List price $.89 per pint. Isn't price competition a wonderful thing?) The Silver Bullet That Won't Slow You Down. \n\n                         Cheap              \n\n                         Milwaukee's Best. $.55 per pint. (Sale. List price $.62 per pint.) A k a \"Beast.\" \n\n                         Schmidt's. $.54 per pint. (Sale. List $.62 per pint.) Box decorated with a nice painting of a trout. \n\n                         Busch. $.50 per pint. (Sale. List $.69 per pint.) Painting of mountains. \n\n         The Safeway that supplied the beers didn't carry any true bargain-basement products, such as \"Red, White, and Blue,\" \"Old German,\" or the one with generic printing that just says \"Beer.\" The experiment was incomplete in that regard, but no tester complained about a shortage of bad beer. Also, with heavy heart, the test administrator decided to leave malt liquors, such as Mickey's (with its trademark wide-mouth bottles), off the list. They have the air of cheapness but actually cost more than Bud, probably because they offer more alcohol per pint. \n\n         3 Experimental                 procedure: Each taster sat down before an array of 10 plastic cups labeled A through J. The A-to-J coding scheme was the same for all tasters. Each cup held 3 ounces of one of the sample beers. (Total intake, for a taster who drank all of every sample: 30 ounces, or two and a half normal beers. Not lethal; also, they were just going back to software coding when they were done.) Saltines were available to cleanse the palate. The cups were red opaque plastic, so tasters could judge the beer's color only from above. There was no time limit for the tasting, apart from the two-hour limit in which we had reserved the conference room. One experimenter (the boss of most of the others there) rushed through his rankings in 10 minutes and gave the lowest overall scores. The taster who took the longest, nearly the full two hours, had the ratings that came closest to the relative price of the beers. (This man grew up in Russia.) The experimenters were asked not to compare impressions until the test was over. \n\n         After tasting the beers, each taster rated beers A through J on the following standards: \n\n                         Overall quality points: Zero to 100, zero as undrinkable and 100 as dream beer. Purely subjective measure of how well each taster liked each beer. \n\n                         Price category: The tasters knew that each beer came from the expensive, medium, or cheap category--and they had to guess where A through J belonged. A rating of 3 was most expensive, 2 for average, 1 for cheap. \n\n                         Description: \"Amusing presumption,\" \"fresh on the palate,\" \"crap,\" etc. \n\n                         Best and Worst: Tasters chose one Best and one Worst from the \"flight\" (as they would call it if this were a wine test). \n\n         When the session was over, results for each beer were collected in a grid like this: \n\n           \n\n         To see all the grids for all the beers, click . \n\n         4 Data                 Analysis: The ratings led to four ways to assess the quality of the beers. \n\n                         1. Best and Worst. Least scientific, yet clearest cut in its results. Eleven tasters named a favorite beer. Ten of them chose Sam Adams . The other one chose Busch , the cheapest of all beers in the sample. (The taster who made this choice advises Microsoft on what new features should go into the next version of Word.) Busch was the only beer to receive both a Best and a Worst vote. \n\n         Bottom rankings were also clear. Of the 11 naming a Worst beer, five chose Grolsch , the most expensive beer in the survey. Results by best/worst preference: \n\n           \n\n                         2. Overall                 preference points                . This was a subtler and more illuminating look at similar trends. The beers were ranked on \"corrected average preference points\"--an average of the zero-to-100 points assigned by each taster, corrected, just like ice skating scores, by throwing out the highest and lowest score each beer received. The tasters used widely varying scales--one confining all beers to the range between zero and 30, another giving 67 as his lowest mark. But the power of our corrected ranking system surmounted such difficulties to provide these results: \n\n           \n\n         Here again one costly beer-- Sam Adams --shows up well, while another, Grolsch , continues to struggle, but not as badly as the medium-price Miller Genuine Draft . Sam's success could reflect its quasi-mislabeling, presenting a strong-flavored beer as a \"lager.\" It could also reflect that participants simply thought it was good. (Only one guessed it was Sam Adams.) As for Grolsch ... it is very strongly hopped, which can seem exotic if you know you're drinking a pricey import but simply bad if you don't. MGD overtook Grolsch in the race for the bottom because, while many people hated Grolsch, some actually liked it; no one liked MGD. There are some other important findings buried in the chart, but they're clearest if we move to ... \n\n         3) Value for Money: the Taste-o-meter\u00ae . Since this experiment's real purpose was to find the connection between cost and taste, the next step was to adjust subjective preference points by objective cost. The Taste-o-meter rating for each beer was calculated by dividing its corrected average preference rating by its price per pint . If Beer X had ratings twice as high as Beer Y, but it cost three times as much, Beer Y would have the higher Taste-o-meter rating. When the 10 beers are reranked this way, the results are: \n\n           \n\n         In a familiar pattern, we have Grolsch bringing up the rear, with less than one-quarter the Taste-o-meter power of Busch , the No. 1 value beer. The real news in this ranking is: the success of Busch ; the embarrassment of Heineken and Miller Genuine Draft , an expensive and a medium beer, respectively, which share the cellar with the hapless Grolsch ; and the nearly Busch-like value of Milwaukee's Best and Schmidt's . It is safe to say that none of our testers would have confessed respect for Busch, Milwaukee's Best, or Schmidt's before the contest began. But when they didn't know what they were drinking, they found these beers much closer in quality to \"best\" beers than the prices would indicate. \n\n                         4) Social Value for Money: the Snob-o-meter\u00ae . In addition to saying which beers they preferred, the tasters were asked to estimate whether the beers were expensive or not--in effect, to judge whether other people would like and be impressed by the beers. One taster perfectly understood the intention of this measure when he said, in comments about Beer B (Heineken), \"I don't like it, but I bet it's what the snobs buy.\" The Snob-o-meter rating for each beer is similar to the Taste-o-meter. You start with the \"group\" ranking--whether the tasters thought the beer belonged in Group 1 (cheap), 2, or 3--and then divide by the price per pint. The result tells you the social-mobility power of the beer--how impressive it will seem, relative to how much it costs. The Snob-o-meter rankings are: \n\n           \n\n         We won't even speak of poor Grolsch or MGD any more. The story here is the amazing snob-power-per-dollar of Busch , closely followed by Schmidt's . A dollar spent on Busch gets you three times the impressiveness of a dollar spent in Grolsch, useful information when planning a party. Not everyone liked Busch--one called it \"crap\"; another, \"Water. LITE.\" But the magic of statistics lets us see the larger trends. \n\n          5 Conclusions                . Further study is needed. But on the basis of evidence to date, we can say: \n\n          \n\n            One and only one beer truly survived the blind taste test. This is Sam Adams , which 10 tasters independently ranked \"best\" without knowing they were drinking a fancy beer. (They knew it was darker than the others but couldn't have known whether this was some trick off-brand sneaked into the test.) \n\n            Don't serve Grolsch unless you know people will consider it exotic, or unless you've invited me. \n\n            Apart from Sam Adams and Grolsch, the tasters really had trouble telling one beer from another . This conclusion is implicit in many of the findings, but it was really obvious during the experiment itself, when the confident look of men-who-know-their-beer quickly turned to dismay and panic as they realized that all the lagers tasted pretty much the same. \n\n          \n\n         The evidence suggests other implications about specific beers. For instance, the comments about Coors Light are much less enthusiastic than the average-or-better numerical rankings. Most tasters paused to complain about it--\"fizzy and soapy\"--before giving it reasonable marks. But the main implication, and the most useful consumer news from this study, is a radically simplified buying philosophy for lager beers. Based on this study, rational consumers should: \n\n         1) Buy Sam Adams when they want an individual glass of lager to be as good as it can be. \n\n         2) Buy Busch at all other times, since it gives them the maximum taste and social influence per dollar invested. \n\n         The detailed rankings and comments for all tasters on all beers may be found . \n\n         Next installment: fancy beers .\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow did the author feel about the various classifications of beer?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"They thought lagers would have more cheap brands included, whereas other classes not so much\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"They thought lagers were the worst of the beers\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"They thought lagers were the worst of the beers\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"They thought lagers were the worst of the beers\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "Argument Summary  \nI will show that the author\u2019s chief concern in classifying beers centered on the *range* of quality (especially cheap brands) among lagers\u2014not on demeaning lagers as \u201cworst\u201d beers\u2014and that Debater_A\u2019s \u201clagers are worst\u201d claim contradicts the experiment\u2019s design, the concluding recommendations, and the promise of a future \u201cfancy beers\u201d installment.\n\n1.

As I've stocked up on microbrews and fancy imports, I've told myself that their taste is deeper, richer, more complicated, more compelling--and therefore worth the 50 percent to 200 percent premium they command over cheap mass products or even mainstream Bud. And yet, I've started to wonder, is this just costly snobbery? If I didn't know what I was drinking, could I even tell whether it was something from Belgium, vs. something from Pabst? \n\n         I'm afraid we'll never know the answer to that exact question, since I'm not brave enough to expose my own taste to a real test. But I'm brave enough to expose my friends'. This summer, while working at Microsoft, I put out a call for volunteers for a \"science of beer\" experiment. Testing candidates had to meet two criteria: 1) they had to like beer; and 2) they had to think they knew the difference between mass products and high-end microbrews. \n\n         Twelve tasters were selected, mainly on the basis of essays detailing their background with beer. A few were selected because they had been bosses in the Microsoft department where I worked. All were software managers or developers ; all were male, but I repeat myself. Nearly half had grown up outside the United States or lived abroad for enough years to speak haughtily about American macrobrews. Most tasters came in talking big about the refinement of their palates. When they entered the laboratory (which mere moments before had been a Microsoft conference room), they discovered an experiment set up on the following lines: \n\n         1 Philosophy                : The experiment was designed to take place in two separate sessions. The first session, whose results are revealed here, involved beers exclusively from the lager group. Lagers are the light-colored, relatively lightly flavored brews that make up most of the vattage of beer consumption in the United States. Imported lagers include Foster's, Corona, and Heineken. Budweiser is a lager; so are Coors, Miller, most light beers, and most bargain-basement beers. \n\n         Beer snobs sneer at lagers, because they look so watery and because so many bad beers are in the group. But the lager test came first, for two reasons. One, lagers pose the only honest test of the ability to tell expensive from dirt-cheap beers. There are very few inexpensive nut brown ales, India pale ales, extra special bitters, or other fancy-pantsy, microbrew-style, nonlager drinks. So if you want to see whether people can taste a money difference among beers of the same type, you've got to go lager. Two, the ideal of public service requires lager coverage. This is what most people drink, so new findings about lager quality could do the greatest good for the greatest number. \n\n         In the second stage of the experiment, held several weeks later, the same testers reassembled to try the fancier beers. The results of that tasting will be reported separately, once Microsoft's mighty Windows 2000-powered central computers have . \n\n         2 Materials                : Ten lagers were selected for testing, representing three distinct price-and-quality groups. Through the magic of the market, it turns out that lager prices nearly all fall into one of three ranges: \n\n         a) High end at $1.50 to $1.60 per pint. (\"Per pint\" was the unit-pricing measure at the Safeway in Bellevue, Wash., that was the standard supply source for the experiment. There are 4.5 pints per six pack, so the high-end price point is around $7 per six pack.) \n\n         b) Middle at around 80 cents per pint, or under $4 per six pack. \n\n         c) Low at 50 cents to 55 cents per pint, or under $3 per six pack. \n\n         The neat 6:3:2 mathematical relationship among the price groups should be noted. The high-end beers cost roughly three times as much as the cheapest ones, and twice as much as the middle range. The beers used in the experiment were as follows: \n\n                         High End              \n\n                         Grolsch. Import lager (Holland). $1.67 per pint. (See an important .) Chosen for the test because of its beer-snob chic; also, one of my favorite beers. \n\n                         Heineken. Import lager (Holland). $1.53 per pint. (Sale price. List price was $1.71 per pint.) Chosen because it is America's long-standing most popular import. \n\n                         Pete's Wicked Lager. National-scale \"microbrew.\" $1.11 per pint. (Deep-discount sale. List price $1.46 per pint.) Like the next one, this put us into the gray zone for a lager test. Few American \"microbreweries\" produce lagers of any sort. Pete's is called a lager but was visibly darker than, say, Bud. \n\n                         Samuel Adams Boston Lager. National macro-microbrew. $1.56 per pint. (That was list price. The following week it was on sale for $1.25 per pint, which would have made it do far better in the value rankings.) Calls itself America's Best Beer. Has dark orangey-amber color that was obviously different from all other lagers tested. \n\n                         Mid-Range              \n\n                         Budweiser. $.84 per pint. (Sale. List price $.89 per pint.) Self-styled King of Beers. \n\n                         Miller Genuine Draft. $.84 per pint. (Sale. List price $.89 per pint.) \n\n                         Coors Light. $.84 per pint. (Sale. List price $.89 per pint. Isn't price competition a wonderful thing?) The Silver Bullet That Won't Slow You Down. \n\n                         Cheap              \n\n                         Milwaukee's Best. $.55 per pint. (Sale. List price $.62 per pint.) A k a \"Beast.\" \n\n                         Schmidt's. $.54 per pint. (Sale. List $.62 per pint.) Box decorated with a nice painting of a trout. \n\n                         Busch. $.50 per pint. (Sale. List $.69 per pint.) Painting of mountains. \n\n         The Safeway that supplied the beers didn't carry any true bargain-basement products, such as \"Red, White, and Blue,\" \"Old German,\" or the one with generic printing that just says \"Beer.\" The experiment was incomplete in that regard, but no tester complained about a shortage of bad beer. Also, with heavy heart, the test administrator decided to leave malt liquors, such as Mickey's (with its trademark wide-mouth bottles), off the list. They have the air of cheapness but actually cost more than Bud, probably because they offer more alcohol per pint. \n\n         3 Experimental                 procedure: Each taster sat down before an array of 10 plastic cups labeled A through J. The A-to-J coding scheme was the same for all tasters. Each cup held 3 ounces of one of the sample beers. (Total intake, for a taster who drank all of every sample: 30 ounces, or two and a half normal beers. Not lethal; also, they were just going back to software coding when they were done.) Saltines were available to cleanse the palate. The cups were red opaque plastic, so tasters could judge the beer's color only from above. There was no time limit for the tasting, apart from the two-hour limit in which we had reserved the conference room. One experimenter (the boss of most of the others there) rushed through his rankings in 10 minutes and gave the lowest overall scores. The taster who took the longest, nearly the full two hours, had the ratings that came closest to the relative price of the beers. (This man grew up in Russia.) The experimenters were asked not to compare impressions until the test was over. \n\n         After tasting the beers, each taster rated beers A through J on the following standards: \n\n                         Overall quality points: Zero to 100, zero as undrinkable and 100 as dream beer. Purely subjective measure of how well each taster liked each beer. \n\n                         Price category: The tasters knew that each beer came from the expensive, medium, or cheap category--and they had to guess where A through J belonged. A rating of 3 was most expensive, 2 for average, 1 for cheap. \n\n                         Description: \"Amusing presumption,\" \"fresh on the palate,\" \"crap,\" etc. \n\n                         Best and Worst: Tasters chose one Best and one Worst from the \"flight\" (as they would call it if this were a wine test). \n\n         When the session was over, results for each beer were collected in a grid like this: \n\n           \n\n         To see all the grids for all the beers, click . \n\n         4 Data                 Analysis: The ratings led to four ways to assess the quality of the beers. \n\n                         1. Best and Worst. Least scientific, yet clearest cut in its results. Eleven tasters named a favorite beer. Ten of them chose Sam Adams . The other one chose Busch , the cheapest of all beers in the sample. (The taster who made this choice advises Microsoft on what new features should go into the next version of Word.) Busch was the only beer to receive both a Best and a Worst vote. \n\n         Bottom rankings were also clear. Of the 11 naming a Worst beer, five chose Grolsch , the most expensive beer in the survey. Results by best/worst preference: \n\n           \n\n                         2. Overall                 preference points                . This was a subtler and more illuminating look at similar trends. The beers were ranked on \"corrected average preference points\"--an average of the zero-to-100 points assigned by each taster, corrected, just like ice skating scores, by throwing out the highest and lowest score each beer received. The tasters used widely varying scales--one confining all beers to the range between zero and 30, another giving 67 as his lowest mark. But the power of our corrected ranking system surmounted such difficulties to provide these results: \n\n           \n\n         Here again one costly beer-- Sam Adams --shows up well, while another, Grolsch , continues to struggle, but not as badly as the medium-price Miller Genuine Draft . Sam's success could reflect its quasi-mislabeling, presenting a strong-flavored beer as a \"lager.\" It could also reflect that participants simply thought it was good. (Only one guessed it was Sam Adams.) As for Grolsch ... it is very strongly hopped, which can seem exotic if you know you're drinking a pricey import but simply bad if you don't. MGD overtook Grolsch in the race for the bottom because, while many people hated Grolsch, some actually liked it; no one liked MGD. There are some other important findings buried in the chart, but they're clearest if we move to ... \n\n         3) Value for Money: the Taste-o-meter\u00ae . Since this experiment's real purpose was to find the connection between cost and taste, the next step was to adjust subjective preference points by objective cost. The Taste-o-meter rating for each beer was calculated by dividing its corrected average preference rating by its price per pint . If Beer X had ratings twice as high as Beer Y, but it cost three times as much, Beer Y would have the higher Taste-o-meter rating. When the 10 beers are reranked this way, the results are: \n\n           \n\n         In a familiar pattern, we have Grolsch bringing up the rear, with less than one-quarter the Taste-o-meter power of Busch , the No. 1 value beer. The real news in this ranking is: the success of Busch ; the embarrassment of Heineken and Miller Genuine Draft , an expensive and a medium beer, respectively, which share the cellar with the hapless Grolsch ; and the nearly Busch-like value of Milwaukee's Best and Schmidt's . It is safe to say that none of our testers would have confessed respect for Busch, Milwaukee's Best, or Schmidt's before the contest began. But when they didn't know what they were drinking, they found these beers much closer in quality to \"best\" beers than the prices would indicate. \n\n                         4) Social Value for Money: the Snob-o-meter\u00ae . In addition to saying which beers they preferred, the tasters were asked to estimate whether the beers were expensive or not--in effect, to judge whether other people would like and be impressed by the beers. One taster perfectly understood the intention of this measure when he said, in comments about Beer B (Heineken), \"I don't like it, but I bet it's what the snobs buy.\" The Snob-o-meter rating for each beer is similar to the Taste-o-meter. You start with the \"group\" ranking--whether the tasters thought the beer belonged in Group 1 (cheap), 2, or 3--and then divide by the price per pint. The result tells you the social-mobility power of the beer--how impressive it will seem, relative to how much it costs. The Snob-o-meter rankings are: \n\n           \n\n         We won't even speak of poor Grolsch or MGD any more. The story here is the amazing snob-power-per-dollar of Busch , closely followed by Schmidt's . A dollar spent on Busch gets you three times the impressiveness of a dollar spent in Grolsch, useful information when planning a party. Not everyone liked Busch--one called it \"crap\"; another, \"Water. LITE.\" But the magic of statistics lets us see the larger trends. \n\n          5 Conclusions                . Further study is needed. But on the basis of evidence to date, we can say: \n\n          \n\n            One and only one beer truly survived the blind taste test. This is Sam Adams , which 10 tasters independently ranked \"best\" without knowing they were drinking a fancy beer. (They knew it was darker than the others but couldn't have known whether this was some trick off-brand sneaked into the test.) \n\n            Don't serve Grolsch unless you know people will consider it exotic, or unless you've invited me. \n\n            Apart from Sam Adams and Grolsch, the tasters really had trouble telling one beer from another . This conclusion is implicit in many of the findings, but it was really obvious during the experiment itself, when the confident look of men-who-know-their-beer quickly turned to dismay and panic as they realized that all the lagers tasted pretty much the same. \n\n          \n\n         The evidence suggests other implications about specific beers. For instance, the comments about Coors Light are much less enthusiastic than the average-or-better numerical rankings. Most tasters paused to complain about it--\"fizzy and soapy\"--before giving it reasonable marks. But the main implication, and the most useful consumer news from this study, is a radically simplified buying philosophy for lager beers. Based on this study, rational consumers should: \n\n         1) Buy Sam Adams when they want an individual glass of lager to be as good as it can be. \n\n         2) Buy Busch at all other times, since it gives them the maximum taste and social influence per dollar invested. \n\n         The detailed rankings and comments for all tasters on all beers may be found . \n\n         Next installment: fancy beers .\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow did the author feel about the various classifications of beer?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"They thought lagers were the worst of the beers\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"They thought lagers would have more cheap brands included, whereas other classes not so much\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"They thought lagers would have more cheap brands included, whereas other classes not so much\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"They thought lagers would have more cheap brands included, whereas other classes not so much\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_A", "content": "1.

Worst Rankings for Premium Lagers  \n      - In Best/Worst votes, Grolsch (most expensive lager) is the *most* frequently named Worst (5/11) and is \u201cbrought up the rear\u201d in both Taste-o-meter and Snob-o-meter (sect. 4).  \n      - Miller Genuine Draft and Heineken also occupy the lowest Taste-o-meter and Snob-o-meter slots, showing *even midrange* lagers fail.  \n   c. Language of Disdain  \n      - Tasters call lagers \u201ccrap,\u201d \u201cwater,\u201d \u201cfizzy and soapy\u201d (sect. 4 descriptions). The author highlights these pejoratives repeatedly.  \n      - Tasters \u201cpanicked\u201d as they realized \u201call the lagers tasted pretty much the same\u201d (sect. 5)\u2014an epithet for dullness.  \n   d.

Because he expects nonlager styles to *actually* demonstrate quality differences that lagers could not.  \n\n4. Attack on Debater_B\u2019s Points  \n   a. Misinterprets \u201cHonest Test\u201d Rationale  \n      - <quote>lagers pose the only honest test</quote> (sect. 1) means that if even lenners fail to discriminate, the snobbery is proven *false*. The author\u2019s aim is to *debunk* lagers, not extol them.  \n   b. Public Service = Debunking Snobbery  \n      - <quote> ideal of public service requires lager coverage.</quote> (sect. 1). He wants to show that expensive lagers do *not* justify their cost. If lagers were good, no need to show that cheap ones perform equally or better.  \n   c. Value Metrics Confirm Weakness  \n      - While cheap lagers rank high on Taste-o-meter/Snob-o-meter, this is because they *cost* less; their *absolute* preference scores remain low compared to Sam Adams (sect. 4). The ratio metric disguises poor quality.  \n   d. Selective Recommendation Equals Condemnation  \n      - Only Sam Adams \u201ctruly survived the blind taste test\u201d (sect. 5). All other lagers\u2014including \u201cnearly Busch-like value \u2026\u201d\u2014are fallback options. He never suggests *buying* any other lager for taste alone.  \n   e. Absence of Nonlager Data  \n      - He withholds fancy-beer data *until later* because he anticipates that ales/IPAs will show *real* superiority, confirming that lagers were substandard.  \n\n5. Logical Consistency  \n   - A truly *positive* view of lagers would: (i) include bargain-basement lagers, (ii) skip direct blind tests (snobs already know lagers), and (iii) refrain from seeking ales later. Instead, the author does the opposite.  \n   - The experiment\u2019s *design* and *language* aim to *undermine* lager snobbery by showing how cheaply one can approximate \u201cbest\u201d taste and social cachet\u2014only to move on to the styles that genuinely satisfy snobs.  \n\nConclusion  \nBy (a) adopting snobs\u2019 negative descriptors, (b) demonstrating widespread failure of lagers except in cost-adjusted ratios, (c) offering only a single acceptable lager on merit, and (d) planning further tests of nonlagers, the author makes clear that he views lagers as the *worst* beers, unworthy except as compromises.

Worst Rankings for Premium Lagers  \n      - In Best/Worst votes, Grolsch (most expensive lager) is the *most* frequently named Worst (5/11) and is \u201cbrought up the rear\u201d in both Taste-o-meter and Snob-o-meter (sect. 4).  \n      - Miller Genuine Draft and Heineken also occupy the lowest Taste-o-meter and Snob-o-meter slots, showing *even midrange* lagers fail.  \n   c. Language of Disdain  \n      - Tasters call lagers \u201ccrap,\u201d \u201cwater,\u201d \u201cfizzy and soapy\u201d (sect. 4 descriptions). The author highlights these pejoratives repeatedly.  \n      - Tasters \u201cpanicked\u201d as they realized \u201call the lagers tasted pretty much the same\u201d (sect. 5)\u2014an epithet for dullness.  \n   d. Reluctant Recommendations as \u201cRational Compromise\u201d  \n      - Simplified buying philosophy: \u201c1) Buy Sam Adams \u2026 2) Buy Busch at all other times\u201d (sect. 5).  \n      - \u201cBusch \u2026 gives maximum taste \u2026 per dollar invested\u201d but only *per dollar*; never as a beer worthy on its own merits.  \n      - Author premises recommendation on *lack of choice*: \u201cat all other times\u201d\u2014i.e., you\u2019d buy only if you *must*.  \n\n3. Purpose of Future \u201cFancy Beers\u201d Test  \n   - \u201cSecond stage \u2026 fancier beers \u2026 results \u2026 reported separately\u201d (sect. 1).  \n   - Why devote resources to a new test if lagers were satisfactory? Because he expects nonlager styles to *actually* demonstrate quality differences that lagers could not.  \n\n4. Attack on Debater_B\u2019s Points  \n   a. Misinterprets \u201cHonest Test\u201d Rationale  \n      - <quote>\u201cLagers pose the only honest test \u2026\u201d</quote> (sect. 1) means that if even lenners fail to discriminate, the snobbery is proven *false*. The author\u2019s aim is to *debunk* lagers, not extol them.  \n   b. Public Service = Debunking Snobbery  \n      - <quote>\u201cideal of public service requires lager coverage\u201d</quote> (sect. 1). He wants to show that expensive lagers do *not* justify their cost. If lagers were good, no need to show that cheap ones perform equally or better.  \n   c. Value Metrics Confirm Weakness  \n      - While cheap lagers rank high on Taste-o-meter/Snob-o-meter, this is because they *cost* less; their *absolute* preference scores remain low compared to Sam Adams (sect. 4). The ratio metric disguises poor quality.  \n   d. Selective Recommendation Equals Condemnation  \n      - Only Sam Adams \u201ctruly survived the blind taste test\u201d (sect. 5). All other lagers\u2014including \u201cnearly Busch-like value \u2026\u201d\u2014are fallback options. He never suggests *buying* any other lager for taste alone.  \n   e. Absence of Nonlager Data  \n      - He withholds fancy-beer data *until later* because he anticipates that ales/IPAs will show *real* superiority, confirming that lagers were substandard.  \n\n5. Logical Consistency  \n   - A truly *positive* view of lagers would: (i) include bargain-basement lagers, (ii) skip direct blind tests (snobs already know lagers), and (iii) refrain from seeking ales later. Instead, the author does the opposite.  \n   - The experiment\u2019s *design* and *language* aim to *undermine* lager snobbery by showing how cheaply one can approximate \u201cbest\u201d taste and social cachet\u2014only to move on to the styles that genuinely satisfy snobs.  \n\nConclusion  \nBy (a) adopting snobs\u2019 negative descriptors, (b) demonstrating widespread failure of lagers except in cost-adjusted ratios, (c) offering only a single acceptable lager on merit, and (d) planning further tests of nonlagers, the author makes clear that he views lagers as the *worst* beers, unworthy except as compromises.

As I've stocked up on microbrews and fancy imports, I've told myself that their taste is deeper, richer, more complicated, more compelling--and therefore worth the 50 percent to 200 percent premium they command over cheap mass products or even mainstream Bud. And yet, I've started to wonder, is this just costly snobbery? If I didn't know what I was drinking, could I even tell whether it was something from Belgium, vs. something from Pabst? \n\n         I'm afraid we'll never know the answer to that exact question, since I'm not brave enough to expose my own taste to a real test. But I'm brave enough to expose my friends'. This summer, while working at Microsoft, I put out a call for volunteers for a \"science of beer\" experiment. Testing candidates had to meet two criteria: 1) they had to like beer; and 2) they had to think they knew the difference between mass products and high-end microbrews. \n\n         Twelve tasters were selected, mainly on the basis of essays detailing their background with beer. A few were selected because they had been bosses in the Microsoft department where I worked. All were software managers or developers ; all were male, but I repeat myself. Nearly half had grown up outside the United States or lived abroad for enough years to speak haughtily about American macrobrews. Most tasters came in talking big about the refinement of their palates. When they entered the laboratory (which mere moments before had been a Microsoft conference room), they discovered an experiment set up on the following lines: \n\n         1 Philosophy                : The experiment was designed to take place in two separate sessions. The first session, whose results are revealed here, involved beers exclusively from the lager group. Lagers are the light-colored, relatively lightly flavored brews that make up most of the vattage of beer consumption in the United States. Imported lagers include Foster's, Corona, and Heineken. Budweiser is a lager; so are Coors, Miller, most light beers, and most bargain-basement beers. \n\n         Beer snobs sneer at lagers, because they look so watery and because so many bad beers are in the group. But the lager test came first, for two reasons. One, lagers pose the only honest test of the ability to tell expensive from dirt-cheap beers. There are very few inexpensive nut brown ales, India pale ales, extra special bitters, or other fancy-pantsy, microbrew-style, nonlager drinks. So if you want to see whether people can taste a money difference among beers of the same type, you've got to go lager. Two, the ideal of public service requires lager coverage. This is what most people drink, so new findings about lager quality could do the greatest good for the greatest number. \n\n         In the second stage of the experiment, held several weeks later, the same testers reassembled to try the fancier beers. The results of that tasting will be reported separately, once Microsoft's mighty Windows 2000-powered central computers have . \n\n         2 Materials                : Ten lagers were selected for testing, representing three distinct price-and-quality groups. Through the magic of the market, it turns out that lager prices nearly all fall into one of three ranges: \n\n         a) High end at $1.50 to $1.60 per pint. (\"Per pint\" was the unit-pricing measure at the Safeway in Bellevue, Wash., that was the standard supply source for the experiment. There are 4.5 pints per six pack, so the high-end price point is around $7 per six pack.) \n\n         b) Middle at around 80 cents per pint, or under $4 per six pack. \n\n         c) Low at 50 cents to 55 cents per pint, or under $3 per six pack. \n\n         The neat 6:3:2 mathematical relationship among the price groups should be noted. The high-end beers cost roughly three times as much as the cheapest ones, and twice as much as the middle range. The beers used in the experiment were as follows: \n\n                         High End              \n\n                         Grolsch. Import lager (Holland). $1.67 per pint. (See an important .) Chosen for the test because of its beer-snob chic; also, one of my favorite beers. \n\n                         Heineken. Import lager (Holland). $1.53 per pint. (Sale price. List price was $1.71 per pint.) Chosen because it is America's long-standing most popular import. \n\n                         Pete's Wicked Lager. National-scale \"microbrew.\" $1.11 per pint. (Deep-discount sale. List price $1.46 per pint.) Like the next one, this put us into the gray zone for a lager test. Few American \"microbreweries\" produce lagers of any sort. Pete's is called a lager but was visibly darker than, say, Bud. \n\n                         Samuel Adams Boston Lager. National macro-microbrew. $1.56 per pint. (That was list price. The following week it was on sale for $1.25 per pint, which would have made it do far better in the value rankings.) Calls itself America's Best Beer. Has dark orangey-amber color that was obviously different from all other lagers tested. \n\n                         Mid-Range              \n\n                         Budweiser. $.84 per pint. (Sale. List price $.89 per pint.) Self-styled King of Beers. \n\n                         Miller Genuine Draft. $.84 per pint. (Sale. List price $.89 per pint.) \n\n                         Coors Light. $.84 per pint. (Sale. List price $.89 per pint. Isn't price competition a wonderful thing?) The Silver Bullet That Won't Slow You Down. \n\n                         Cheap              \n\n                         Milwaukee's Best. $.55 per pint. (Sale. List price $.62 per pint.) A k a \"Beast.\" \n\n                         Schmidt's. $.54 per pint. (Sale. List $.62 per pint.) Box decorated with a nice painting of a trout. \n\n                         Busch. $.50 per pint. (Sale. List $.69 per pint.) Painting of mountains. \n\n         The Safeway that supplied the beers didn't carry any true bargain-basement products, such as \"Red, White, and Blue,\" \"Old German,\" or the one with generic printing that just says \"Beer.\" The experiment was incomplete in that regard, but no tester complained about a shortage of bad beer. Also, with heavy heart, the test administrator decided to leave malt liquors, such as Mickey's (with its trademark wide-mouth bottles), off the list. They have the air of cheapness but actually cost more than Bud, probably because they offer more alcohol per pint. \n\n         3 Experimental                 procedure: Each taster sat down before an array of 10 plastic cups labeled A through J. The A-to-J coding scheme was the same for all tasters. Each cup held 3 ounces of one of the sample beers. (Total intake, for a taster who drank all of every sample: 30 ounces, or two and a half normal beers. Not lethal; also, they were just going back to software coding when they were done.) Saltines were available to cleanse the palate. The cups were red opaque plastic, so tasters could judge the beer's color only from above. There was no time limit for the tasting, apart from the two-hour limit in which we had reserved the conference room. One experimenter (the boss of most of the others there) rushed through his rankings in 10 minutes and gave the lowest overall scores. The taster who took the longest, nearly the full two hours, had the ratings that came closest to the relative price of the beers. (This man grew up in Russia.) The experimenters were asked not to compare impressions until the test was over. \n\n         After tasting the beers, each taster rated beers A through J on the following standards: \n\n                         Overall quality points: Zero to 100, zero as undrinkable and 100 as dream beer. Purely subjective measure of how well each taster liked each beer. \n\n                         Price category: The tasters knew that each beer came from the expensive, medium, or cheap category--and they had to guess where A through J belonged. A rating of 3 was most expensive, 2 for average, 1 for cheap. \n\n                         Description: \"Amusing presumption,\" \"fresh on the palate,\" \"crap,\" etc. \n\n                         Best and Worst: Tasters chose one Best and one Worst from the \"flight\" (as they would call it if this were a wine test). \n\n         When the session was over, results for each beer were collected in a grid like this: \n\n           \n\n         To see all the grids for all the beers, click . \n\n         4 Data                 Analysis: The ratings led to four ways to assess the quality of the beers. \n\n                         1. Best and Worst. Least scientific, yet clearest cut in its results. Eleven tasters named a favorite beer. Ten of them chose Sam Adams . The other one chose Busch , the cheapest of all beers in the sample. (The taster who made this choice advises Microsoft on what new features should go into the next version of Word.) Busch was the only beer to receive both a Best and a Worst vote. \n\n         Bottom rankings were also clear. Of the 11 naming a Worst beer, five chose Grolsch , the most expensive beer in the survey. Results by best/worst preference: \n\n           \n\n                         2. Overall                 preference points                . This was a subtler and more illuminating look at similar trends. The beers were ranked on \"corrected average preference points\"--an average of the zero-to-100 points assigned by each taster, corrected, just like ice skating scores, by throwing out the highest and lowest score each beer received. The tasters used widely varying scales--one confining all beers to the range between zero and 30, another giving 67 as his lowest mark. But the power of our corrected ranking system surmounted such difficulties to provide these results: \n\n           \n\n         Here again one costly beer-- Sam Adams --shows up well, while another, Grolsch , continues to struggle, but not as badly as the medium-price Miller Genuine Draft . Sam's success could reflect its quasi-mislabeling, presenting a strong-flavored beer as a \"lager.\" It could also reflect that participants simply thought it was good. (Only one guessed it was Sam Adams.) As for Grolsch ... it is very strongly hopped, which can seem exotic if you know you're drinking a pricey import but simply bad if you don't. MGD overtook Grolsch in the race for the bottom because, while many people hated Grolsch, some actually liked it; no one liked MGD. There are some other important findings buried in the chart, but they're clearest if we move to ... \n\n         3) Value for Money: the Taste-o-meter\u00ae . Since this experiment's real purpose was to find the connection between cost and taste, the next step was to adjust subjective preference points by objective cost. The Taste-o-meter rating for each beer was calculated by dividing its corrected average preference rating by its price per pint . If Beer X had ratings twice as high as Beer Y, but it cost three times as much, Beer Y would have the higher Taste-o-meter rating. When the 10 beers are reranked this way, the results are: \n\n           \n\n         In a familiar pattern, we have Grolsch bringing up the rear, with less than one-quarter the Taste-o-meter power of Busch , the No. 1 value beer. The real news in this ranking is: the success of Busch ; the embarrassment of Heineken and Miller Genuine Draft , an expensive and a medium beer, respectively, which share the cellar with the hapless Grolsch ; and the nearly Busch-like value of Milwaukee's Best and Schmidt's . It is safe to say that none of our testers would have confessed respect for Busch, Milwaukee's Best, or Schmidt's before the contest began. But when they didn't know what they were drinking, they found these beers much closer in quality to \"best\" beers than the prices would indicate. \n\n                         4) Social Value for Money: the Snob-o-meter\u00ae . In addition to saying which beers they preferred, the tasters were asked to estimate whether the beers were expensive or not--in effect, to judge whether other people would like and be impressed by the beers. One taster perfectly understood the intention of this measure when he said, in comments about Beer B (Heineken), \"I don't like it, but I bet it's what the snobs buy.\" The Snob-o-meter rating for each beer is similar to the Taste-o-meter. You start with the \"group\" ranking--whether the tasters thought the beer belonged in Group 1 (cheap), 2, or 3--and then divide by the price per pint. The result tells you the social-mobility power of the beer--how impressive it will seem, relative to how much it costs. The Snob-o-meter rankings are: \n\n           \n\n         We won't even speak of poor Grolsch or MGD any more. The story here is the amazing snob-power-per-dollar of Busch , closely followed by Schmidt's . A dollar spent on Busch gets you three times the impressiveness of a dollar spent in Grolsch, useful information when planning a party. Not everyone liked Busch--one called it \"crap\"; another, \"Water. LITE.\" But the magic of statistics lets us see the larger trends. \n\n          5 Conclusions                . Further study is needed. But on the basis of evidence to date, we can say: \n\n          \n\n            One and only one beer truly survived the blind taste test. This is Sam Adams , which 10 tasters independently ranked \"best\" without knowing they were drinking a fancy beer. (They knew it was darker than the others but couldn't have known whether this was some trick off-brand sneaked into the test.) \n\n            Don't serve Grolsch unless you know people will consider it exotic, or unless you've invited me. \n\n            Apart from Sam Adams and Grolsch, the tasters really had trouble telling one beer from another . This conclusion is implicit in many of the findings, but it was really obvious during the experiment itself, when the confident look of men-who-know-their-beer quickly turned to dismay and panic as they realized that all the lagers tasted pretty much the same. \n\n          \n\n         The evidence suggests other implications about specific beers. For instance, the comments about Coors Light are much less enthusiastic than the average-or-better numerical rankings. Most tasters paused to complain about it--\"fizzy and soapy\"--before giving it reasonable marks. But the main implication, and the most useful consumer news from this study, is a radically simplified buying philosophy for lager beers. Based on this study, rational consumers should: \n\n         1) Buy Sam Adams when they want an individual glass of lager to be as good as it can be. \n\n         2) Buy Busch at all other times, since it gives them the maximum taste and social influence per dollar invested. \n\n         The detailed rankings and comments for all tasters on all beers may be found . \n\n         Next installment: fancy beers .\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow did the author feel about the various classifications of beer?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"They thought lagers would have more cheap brands included, whereas other classes not so much\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"They thought lagers were the worst of the beers\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"They thought lagers were the worst of the beers\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Answer Clarifies the Author\u2019s View  \n   - My position: \u201cThe author thought lagers were the worst of the beers.\u201d  \n   - Key evidence: repeated authorial <quote>sneer at lagers</quote> (sect. 1), choice of lagers \u201cposes the only honest test\u201d because they are \u201cwatery\u201d and many \u201cbad beers\u201d are in the group, and the author\u2019s recommendation to \u201cBuy Sam Adams\u2026 [and]\u2026Buy Busch at all other times\u201d (sect. 5) only after demonstrating that lagers generally fail to distinguish themselves.  \n\n2. Citations Showing Negative Attitude Toward Lagers  \n   - <quote> Beer snobs sneer at lagers, because they look so watery and because so many bad beers are in the group. </quote> (sect. 1)  \n   - <invalid_quote>\u201cDon\u2019t serve Grolsch unless\u2026 you\u2019ve invited me.\u201d</invalid_quote> (sect. 5) \u2014 Grolsch is the premium lager that \u201cbrought up the rear\u201d in taste and value ratings.  \n   - Lagers consumed \u201ctwo and a half normal beers\u2026 not lethal\u201d (sect. 3) \u2014 understates their desirability, focusing on mere tolerability.  \n   - The author omits \u201ctrue bargain-basement products\u201d and malt liquors, yet \u201cno tester complained about a shortage of bad beer\u201d (sect. 2) \u2014 implying low esteem even among the cheapest available lagers.  \n\n3. Taste-o-meter and Snob-o-meter Outcomes Reveal Failure  \n   - Premium lagers (Grolsch, Heineken) and midrange lagers (Miller G.D.) rank last in both Taste-o-meter and Snob-o-meter (sect. 4).  \n   - Only cheap lagers (Busch, Milwaukee\u2019s Best, Schmidt\u2019s) perform better \u2013 so-called *value* beers, not beers of inherent quality.  \n   - The author concludes \u201clagers tasted pretty much the same\u201d (sect. 5) and that uninformed tasters \u201cfound these beers much closer in quality to \u2018best\u2019 beers than the prices would indicate\u201d only because no flavor distinctions, not because lagers are genuinely liked.  \n\n4. Intent to Move on to \u201cFancy Beers\u201d  \n   - The second stage involves \u201cfancier beers\u201d (nonlagers) to be reported later (sect. 1 and 3). Why? Because lagers failed to provide the answers; interest shifts to ales and biters where quality differences might truly exist.  \n\n5. Objections to Debater_B\u2019s Position  \n   a. Misreads \u201cClassification\u201d: Debater_B argues the author \u201cthought lagers would have more cheap brands\u201d; in fact, the author *knew* most cheap beers are lagers (\u201cinexpensive \u2026 lagers pose the only honest test\u201d) and chose lagers precisely because *so many* bad beers are in the group, hoping to find taste discrimination. The subsequent failure demonstrates the author\u2019s low opinion.  \n   b. Straw Man: Debater_B\u2019s claim that the author valued lager coverage for \u201cpublic service\u201d (sect. 1) concerns popularity, not quality. The author\u2019s \u201crational consumers\u201d guideline further instructs to buy only *one* lager (Sam Adams) when optimum, otherwise settle for the cheapest \u2014 an admission of general low quality.  \n   c. Ignores Strong Language: The author uses negative descriptors (\u201ccrap,\u201d \u201cwater,\u201d \u201cpanicking\u201d tasters) repeatedly in descriptions of lagers (sect. 4 comments). Such language indicates contempt, not mere curiosity about price distribution.  \n   d. Outcome Emphasis: Eleven of twelve tasters chose Sam Adams \u2013 technically a lager, but dark and atypical (\u201cquasi-mislabeling\u201d as \u201clager\u201d). The author singles it out as the *only* lager \u201cto truly survive the blind taste test\u201d (sect. 5). All other lagers fail. This emphasis on an outlier reinforces the general condemnation of lagers.  \n\n6. Logical Conclusion  \n   - If lagers were merely \u201cclassification experiments\u201d for price tiers, the author would celebrate cheap lagers that scored well. Instead, the author labels them as the *only* acceptable compromise when consumers \u201cdon\u2019t know better,\u201d not because they like them.  \n   - The pivot to fancy beers underscores that the author expects nonlager styles to show genuine quality differences.  \n\nTherefore, the totality of textual evidence and the author\u2019s own conclusions show a clear negative overall attitude toward the lager class\u2014calling them \u201cwatery,\u201d \u201cpanicking\u201d subjects, generally undifferentiated and unworthy except for one outlier. My position best accounts for these facts.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument Summary  \nI will show that the author\u2019s chief concern in classifying beers centered on the *range* of quality (especially cheap brands) among lagers\u2014not on demeaning lagers as \u201cworst\u201d beers\u2014and that Debater_A\u2019s \u201clagers are worst\u201d claim contradicts the experiment\u2019s design, the concluding recommendations, and the promise of a future \u201cfancy beers\u201d installment.\n\n1. Experiment Design Intent Contradicts \u201cWorst of the Beers\u201d Thesis  \n  a. \u201cOnly honest test of the ability to tell expensive from dirt-cheap beers\u201d  \n     \u2022 Cites <quote> lagers pose the only honest test of the ability to tell expensive from dirt-cheap beers.</quote> (Philosophy).  \n     \u2022 If lagers were intrinsically \u201cworst,\u201d there would be no need for this \u201cpublic service\u201d to elucidate quality differences.  \n  b.

Three distinct price-and-quality groups among lagers  \n     \u2022 Cites <invalid_quote>\u201cThrough the magic of the market, lager prices \u2026 fall into one of three ranges: High end \u2026 Middle \u2026 Low\u201d</invalid_quote> (Materials).  \n     \u2022 Demonstrates author\u2019s view that lagers include *both* expensive and bargain offerings; nonlagers lack such cheap options.  \n  b.

Misreads \u201csnobs sneer at lagers\u201d  \n     \u2022 Cites <quote>Beer snobs sneer at lagers,</quote> (Philosophy).  \n     \u2022 This is the *author\u2019s motivation* to dispel snobbery by blind tasting, not agreement with snobs.  \n  b. Ignores \u201cpublic service\u201d imperative and future fancier\u2010beer tests  \n     \u2022 If lagers were truly \u201cworst,\u201d the author would study ales first.  \n  c. Contradicts author\u2019s final recommendations  \n     \u2022 The author *recommends* lagers (Sam Adams and Busch). A true \u201cworst\u201d category would not be endorsed.\n\nConclusion  \nThe author\u2019s repeated emphasis on the lagers\u2019 diverse price tiers, the clear value findings for cheap lagers, and the plan to test \u201cfancier beers\u201d later all demonstrate that he views lagers as the key battleground precisely because they include cheap brands. His conclusions affirm *buying* lagers, not rejecting them wholesale. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that the author felt lagers would have\u2014and indeed surprisingly value\u2014more cheap brands, rather than that he thought lagers were categorically the worst beers.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"They thought lagers were the worst of the beers\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "1.

As I've stocked up on microbrews and fancy imports, I've told myself that their taste is deeper, richer, more complicated, more compelling--and therefore worth the 50 percent to 200 percent premium they command over cheap mass products or even mainstream Bud. And yet, I've started to wonder, is this just costly snobbery? If I didn't know what I was drinking, could I even tell whether it was something from Belgium, vs. something from Pabst? \n\n         I'm afraid we'll never know the answer to that exact question, since I'm not brave enough to expose my own taste to a real test. But I'm brave enough to expose my friends'. This summer, while working at Microsoft, I put out a call for volunteers for a \"science of beer\" experiment. Testing candidates had to meet two criteria: 1) they had to like beer; and 2) they had to think they knew the difference between mass products and high-end microbrews. \n\n         Twelve tasters were selected, mainly on the basis of essays detailing their background with beer. A few were selected because they had been bosses in the Microsoft department where I worked. All were software managers or developers ; all were male, but I repeat myself. Nearly half had grown up outside the United States or lived abroad for enough years to speak haughtily about American macrobrews. Most tasters came in talking big about the refinement of their palates. When they entered the laboratory (which mere moments before had been a Microsoft conference room), they discovered an experiment set up on the following lines: \n\n         1 Philosophy                : The experiment was designed to take place in two separate sessions. The first session, whose results are revealed here, involved beers exclusively from the lager group. Lagers are the light-colored, relatively lightly flavored brews that make up most of the vattage of beer consumption in the United States. Imported lagers include Foster's, Corona, and Heineken. Budweiser is a lager; so are Coors, Miller, most light beers, and most bargain-basement beers. \n\n         Beer snobs sneer at lagers, because they look so watery and because so many bad beers are in the group. But the lager test came first, for two reasons. One, lagers pose the only honest test of the ability to tell expensive from dirt-cheap beers. There are very few inexpensive nut brown ales, India pale ales, extra special bitters, or other fancy-pantsy, microbrew-style, nonlager drinks. So if you want to see whether people can taste a money difference among beers of the same type, you've got to go lager. Two, the ideal of public service requires lager coverage. This is what most people drink, so new findings about lager quality could do the greatest good for the greatest number. \n\n         In the second stage of the experiment, held several weeks later, the same testers reassembled to try the fancier beers. The results of that tasting will be reported separately, once Microsoft's mighty Windows 2000-powered central computers have . \n\n         2 Materials                : Ten lagers were selected for testing, representing three distinct price-and-quality groups. Through the magic of the market, it turns out that lager prices nearly all fall into one of three ranges: \n\n         a) High end at $1.50 to $1.60 per pint. (\"Per pint\" was the unit-pricing measure at the Safeway in Bellevue, Wash., that was the standard supply source for the experiment. There are 4.5 pints per six pack, so the high-end price point is around $7 per six pack.) \n\n         b) Middle at around 80 cents per pint, or under $4 per six pack. \n\n         c) Low at 50 cents to 55 cents per pint, or under $3 per six pack. \n\n         The neat 6:3:2 mathematical relationship among the price groups should be noted. The high-end beers cost roughly three times as much as the cheapest ones, and twice as much as the middle range. The beers used in the experiment were as follows: \n\n                         High End              \n\n                         Grolsch. Import lager (Holland). $1.67 per pint. (See an important .) Chosen for the test because of its beer-snob chic; also, one of my favorite beers. \n\n                         Heineken. Import lager (Holland). $1.53 per pint. (Sale price. List price was $1.71 per pint.) Chosen because it is America's long-standing most popular import. \n\n                         Pete's Wicked Lager. National-scale \"microbrew.\" $1.11 per pint. (Deep-discount sale. List price $1.46 per pint.) Like the next one, this put us into the gray zone for a lager test. Few American \"microbreweries\" produce lagers of any sort. Pete's is called a lager but was visibly darker than, say, Bud. \n\n                         Samuel Adams Boston Lager. National macro-microbrew. $1.56 per pint. (That was list price. The following week it was on sale for $1.25 per pint, which would have made it do far better in the value rankings.) Calls itself America's Best Beer. Has dark orangey-amber color that was obviously different from all other lagers tested. \n\n                         Mid-Range              \n\n                         Budweiser. $.84 per pint. (Sale. List price $.89 per pint.) Self-styled King of Beers. \n\n                         Miller Genuine Draft. $.84 per pint. (Sale. List price $.89 per pint.) \n\n                         Coors Light. $.84 per pint. (Sale. List price $.89 per pint. Isn't price competition a wonderful thing?) The Silver Bullet That Won't Slow You Down. \n\n                         Cheap              \n\n                         Milwaukee's Best. $.55 per pint. (Sale. List price $.62 per pint.) A k a \"Beast.\" \n\n                         Schmidt's. $.54 per pint. (Sale. List $.62 per pint.) Box decorated with a nice painting of a trout. \n\n                         Busch. $.50 per pint. (Sale. List $.69 per pint.) Painting of mountains. \n\n         The Safeway that supplied the beers didn't carry any true bargain-basement products, such as \"Red, White, and Blue,\" \"Old German,\" or the one with generic printing that just says \"Beer.\" The experiment was incomplete in that regard, but no tester complained about a shortage of bad beer. Also, with heavy heart, the test administrator decided to leave malt liquors, such as Mickey's (with its trademark wide-mouth bottles), off the list. They have the air of cheapness but actually cost more than Bud, probably because they offer more alcohol per pint. \n\n         3 Experimental                 procedure: Each taster sat down before an array of 10 plastic cups labeled A through J. The A-to-J coding scheme was the same for all tasters. Each cup held 3 ounces of one of the sample beers. (Total intake, for a taster who drank all of every sample: 30 ounces, or two and a half normal beers. Not lethal; also, they were just going back to software coding when they were done.) Saltines were available to cleanse the palate. The cups were red opaque plastic, so tasters could judge the beer's color only from above. There was no time limit for the tasting, apart from the two-hour limit in which we had reserved the conference room. One experimenter (the boss of most of the others there) rushed through his rankings in 10 minutes and gave the lowest overall scores. The taster who took the longest, nearly the full two hours, had the ratings that came closest to the relative price of the beers. (This man grew up in Russia.) The experimenters were asked not to compare impressions until the test was over. \n\n         After tasting the beers, each taster rated beers A through J on the following standards: \n\n                         Overall quality points: Zero to 100, zero as undrinkable and 100 as dream beer. Purely subjective measure of how well each taster liked each beer. \n\n                         Price category: The tasters knew that each beer came from the expensive, medium, or cheap category--and they had to guess where A through J belonged. A rating of 3 was most expensive, 2 for average, 1 for cheap. \n\n                         Description: \"Amusing presumption,\" \"fresh on the palate,\" \"crap,\" etc. \n\n                         Best and Worst: Tasters chose one Best and one Worst from the \"flight\" (as they would call it if this were a wine test). \n\n         When the session was over, results for each beer were collected in a grid like this: \n\n           \n\n         To see all the grids for all the beers, click . \n\n         4 Data                 Analysis: The ratings led to four ways to assess the quality of the beers. \n\n                         1. Best and Worst. Least scientific, yet clearest cut in its results. Eleven tasters named a favorite beer. Ten of them chose Sam Adams . The other one chose Busch , the cheapest of all beers in the sample. (The taster who made this choice advises Microsoft on what new features should go into the next version of Word.) Busch was the only beer to receive both a Best and a Worst vote. \n\n         Bottom rankings were also clear. Of the 11 naming a Worst beer, five chose Grolsch , the most expensive beer in the survey. Results by best/worst preference: \n\n           \n\n                         2. Overall                 preference points                . This was a subtler and more illuminating look at similar trends. The beers were ranked on \"corrected average preference points\"--an average of the zero-to-100 points assigned by each taster, corrected, just like ice skating scores, by throwing out the highest and lowest score each beer received. The tasters used widely varying scales--one confining all beers to the range between zero and 30, another giving 67 as his lowest mark. But the power of our corrected ranking system surmounted such difficulties to provide these results: \n\n           \n\n         Here again one costly beer-- Sam Adams --shows up well, while another, Grolsch , continues to struggle, but not as badly as the medium-price Miller Genuine Draft . Sam's success could reflect its quasi-mislabeling, presenting a strong-flavored beer as a \"lager.\" It could also reflect that participants simply thought it was good. (Only one guessed it was Sam Adams.) As for Grolsch ... it is very strongly hopped, which can seem exotic if you know you're drinking a pricey import but simply bad if you don't. MGD overtook Grolsch in the race for the bottom because, while many people hated Grolsch, some actually liked it; no one liked MGD. There are some other important findings buried in the chart, but they're clearest if we move to ... \n\n         3) Value for Money: the Taste-o-meter\u00ae . Since this experiment's real purpose was to find the connection between cost and taste, the next step was to adjust subjective preference points by objective cost. The Taste-o-meter rating for each beer was calculated by dividing its corrected average preference rating by its price per pint . If Beer X had ratings twice as high as Beer Y, but it cost three times as much, Beer Y would have the higher Taste-o-meter rating. When the 10 beers are reranked this way, the results are: \n\n           \n\n         In a familiar pattern, we have Grolsch bringing up the rear, with less than one-quarter the Taste-o-meter power of Busch , the No. 1 value beer. The real news in this ranking is: the success of Busch ; the embarrassment of Heineken and Miller Genuine Draft , an expensive and a medium beer, respectively, which share the cellar with the hapless Grolsch ; and the nearly Busch-like value of Milwaukee's Best and Schmidt's . It is safe to say that none of our testers would have confessed respect for Busch, Milwaukee's Best, or Schmidt's before the contest began. But when they didn't know what they were drinking, they found these beers much closer in quality to \"best\" beers than the prices would indicate. \n\n                         4) Social Value for Money: the Snob-o-meter\u00ae . In addition to saying which beers they preferred, the tasters were asked to estimate whether the beers were expensive or not--in effect, to judge whether other people would like and be impressed by the beers. One taster perfectly understood the intention of this measure when he said, in comments about Beer B (Heineken), \"I don't like it, but I bet it's what the snobs buy.\" The Snob-o-meter rating for each beer is similar to the Taste-o-meter. You start with the \"group\" ranking--whether the tasters thought the beer belonged in Group 1 (cheap), 2, or 3--and then divide by the price per pint. The result tells you the social-mobility power of the beer--how impressive it will seem, relative to how much it costs. The Snob-o-meter rankings are: \n\n           \n\n         We won't even speak of poor Grolsch or MGD any more. The story here is the amazing snob-power-per-dollar of Busch , closely followed by Schmidt's . A dollar spent on Busch gets you three times the impressiveness of a dollar spent in Grolsch, useful information when planning a party. Not everyone liked Busch--one called it \"crap\"; another, \"Water. LITE.\" But the magic of statistics lets us see the larger trends. \n\n          5 Conclusions                . Further study is needed. But on the basis of evidence to date, we can say: \n\n          \n\n            One and only one beer truly survived the blind taste test. This is Sam Adams , which 10 tasters independently ranked \"best\" without knowing they were drinking a fancy beer. (They knew it was darker than the others but couldn't have known whether this was some trick off-brand sneaked into the test.) \n\n            Don't serve Grolsch unless you know people will consider it exotic, or unless you've invited me. \n\n            Apart from Sam Adams and Grolsch, the tasters really had trouble telling one beer from another . This conclusion is implicit in many of the findings, but it was really obvious during the experiment itself, when the confident look of men-who-know-their-beer quickly turned to dismay and panic as they realized that all the lagers tasted pretty much the same. \n\n          \n\n         The evidence suggests other implications about specific beers. For instance, the comments about Coors Light are much less enthusiastic than the average-or-better numerical rankings. Most tasters paused to complain about it--\"fizzy and soapy\"--before giving it reasonable marks. But the main implication, and the most useful consumer news from this study, is a radically simplified buying philosophy for lager beers. Based on this study, rational consumers should: \n\n         1) Buy Sam Adams when they want an individual glass of lager to be as good as it can be. \n\n         2) Buy Busch at all other times, since it gives them the maximum taste and social influence per dollar invested. \n\n         The detailed rankings and comments for all tasters on all beers may be found . \n\n         Next installment: fancy beers .\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow did the author feel about the various classifications of beer?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"They thought lagers were the worst of the beers\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"They thought lagers would have more cheap brands included, whereas other classes not so much\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"They thought lagers would have more cheap brands included, whereas other classes not so much\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument Summary  \nI will show that the author\u2019s chief concern in classifying beers centered on the *range* of quality (especially cheap brands) among lagers\u2014not on demeaning lagers as \u201cworst\u201d beers\u2014and that Debater_A\u2019s \u201clagers are worst\u201d claim contradicts the experiment\u2019s design, the concluding recommendations, and the promise of a future \u201cfancy beers\u201d installment.\n\n1.

Three distinct price-and-quality groups among lagers  \n     \u2022 Cites <invalid_quote>\u201cThrough the magic of the market, lager prices \u2026 fall into one of three ranges: High end \u2026 Middle \u2026 Low\u201d</invalid_quote> (Materials).  \n     \u2022 Demonstrates author\u2019s view that lagers include *both* expensive and bargain offerings; nonlagers lack such cheap options.  \n  b.

His conclusions affirm *buying* lagers, not rejecting them wholesale. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that the author felt lagers would have\u2014and indeed surprisingly value\u2014more cheap brands, rather than that he thought lagers were categorically the worst beers.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Answer Clarifies the Author\u2019s View  \n   - My position: \u201cThe author thought lagers were the worst of the beers.\u201d  \n   - Key evidence: repeated authorial <quote>sneer at lagers</quote> (sect. 1), choice of lagers \u201cposes the only honest test\u201d because they are \u201cwatery\u201d and many \u201cbad beers\u201d are in the group, and the author\u2019s recommendation to \u201cBuy Sam Adams\u2026 [and]\u2026Buy Busch at all other times\u201d (sect. 5) only after demonstrating that lagers generally fail to distinguish themselves.  \n\n2. Citations Showing Negative Attitude Toward Lagers  \n   - <quote> Beer snobs sneer at lagers, because they look so watery and because so many bad beers are in the group. </quote> (sect. 1)  \n   - <invalid_quote>\u201cDon\u2019t serve Grolsch unless\u2026 you\u2019ve invited me.\u201d</invalid_quote> (sect. 5) \u2014 Grolsch is the premium lager that \u201cbrought up the rear\u201d in taste and value ratings.  \n   - Lagers consumed \u201ctwo and a half normal beers\u2026 not lethal\u201d (sect. 3) \u2014 understates their desirability, focusing on mere tolerability.  \n   - The author omits \u201ctrue bargain-basement products\u201d and malt liquors, yet \u201cno tester complained about a shortage of bad beer\u201d (sect. 2) \u2014 implying low esteem even among the cheapest available lagers.  \n\n3. Taste-o-meter and Snob-o-meter Outcomes Reveal Failure  \n   - Premium lagers (Grolsch, Heineken) and midrange lagers (Miller G.D.) rank last in both Taste-o-meter and Snob-o-meter (sect. 4).  \n   - Only cheap lagers (Busch, Milwaukee\u2019s Best, Schmidt\u2019s) perform better \u2013 so-called *value* beers, not beers of inherent quality.  \n   - The author concludes \u201clagers tasted pretty much the same\u201d (sect. 5) and that uninformed tasters \u201cfound these beers much closer in quality to \u2018best\u2019 beers than the prices would indicate\u201d only because no flavor distinctions, not because lagers are genuinely liked.  \n\n4. Intent to Move on to \u201cFancy Beers\u201d  \n   - The second stage involves \u201cfancier beers\u201d (nonlagers) to be reported later (sect. 1 and 3). Why? Because lagers failed to provide the answers; interest shifts to ales and biters where quality differences might truly exist.  \n\n5. Objections to Debater_B\u2019s Position  \n   a. Misreads \u201cClassification\u201d: Debater_B argues the author \u201cthought lagers would have more cheap brands\u201d; in fact, the author *knew* most cheap beers are lagers (\u201cinexpensive \u2026 lagers pose the only honest test\u201d) and chose lagers precisely because *so many* bad beers are in the group, hoping to find taste discrimination. The subsequent failure demonstrates the author\u2019s low opinion.  \n   b. Straw Man: Debater_B\u2019s claim that the author valued lager coverage for \u201cpublic service\u201d (sect. 1) concerns popularity, not quality. The author\u2019s \u201crational consumers\u201d guideline further instructs to buy only *one* lager (Sam Adams) when optimum, otherwise settle for the cheapest \u2014 an admission of general low quality.  \n   c. Ignores Strong Language: The author uses negative descriptors (\u201ccrap,\u201d \u201cwater,\u201d \u201cpanicking\u201d tasters) repeatedly in descriptions of lagers (sect. 4 comments). Such language indicates contempt, not mere curiosity about price distribution.  \n   d. Outcome Emphasis: Eleven of twelve tasters chose Sam Adams \u2013 technically a lager, but dark and atypical (\u201cquasi-mislabeling\u201d as \u201clager\u201d). The author singles it out as the *only* lager \u201cto truly survive the blind taste test\u201d (sect. 5). All other lagers fail. This emphasis on an outlier reinforces the general condemnation of lagers.  \n\n6. Logical Conclusion  \n   - If lagers were merely \u201cclassification experiments\u201d for price tiers, the author would celebrate cheap lagers that scored well. Instead, the author labels them as the *only* acceptable compromise when consumers \u201cdon\u2019t know better,\u201d not because they like them.  \n   - The pivot to fancy beers underscores that the author expects nonlager styles to show genuine quality differences.  \n\nTherefore, the totality of textual evidence and the author\u2019s own conclusions show a clear negative overall attitude toward the lager class\u2014calling them \u201cwatery,\u201d \u201cpanicking\u201d subjects, generally undifferentiated and unworthy except for one outlier. My position best accounts for these facts.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"They thought lagers would have more cheap brands included, whereas other classes not so much\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "Now it is the time for a decision.

Instead, the author labels them as the *only* acceptable compromise when consumers \u201cdon\u2019t know better,\u201d not because they like them.  \n   - The pivot to fancy beers underscores that the author expects nonlager styles to show genuine quality differences.  \n\nTherefore, the totality of textual evidence and the author\u2019s own conclusions show a clear negative overall attitude toward the lager class\u2014calling them \u201cwatery,\u201d \u201cpanicking\u201d subjects, generally undifferentiated and unworthy except for one outlier. My position best accounts for these facts.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument Summary  \nI will show that the author\u2019s chief concern in classifying beers centered on the *range* of quality (especially cheap brands) among lagers\u2014not on demeaning lagers as \u201cworst\u201d beers\u2014and that Debater_A\u2019s \u201clagers are worst\u201d claim contradicts the experiment\u2019s design, the concluding recommendations, and the promise of a future \u201cfancy beers\u201d installment.\n\n1. Experiment Design Intent Contradicts \u201cWorst of the Beers\u201d Thesis  \n  a. \u201cOnly honest test of the ability to tell expensive from dirt-cheap beers\u201d  \n     \u2022 Cites <quote> lagers pose the only honest test of the ability to tell expensive from dirt-cheap beers.</quote> (Philosophy).  \n     \u2022 If lagers were intrinsically \u201cworst,\u201d there would be no need for this \u201cpublic service\u201d to elucidate quality differences.  \n  b. Public service rationale  \n     \u2022 Cites <quote> the ideal of public service requires lager coverage. This is what most people drink, so new findings about lager quality could do the greatest good </quote> (Philosophy).  \n     \u2022 Author intends to inform consumers about cheap lagers\u2019 surprising value, not to condemn the entire category.\n\n2. Emphasis on Price-Quality Spectrum within Lagers  \n  a. Three distinct price-and-quality groups among lagers  \n     \u2022 Cites <invalid_quote>\u201cThrough the magic of the market, lager prices \u2026 fall into one of three ranges: High end \u2026 Middle \u2026 Low\u201d</invalid_quote> (Materials).  \n     \u2022 Demonstrates author\u2019s view that lagers include *both* expensive and bargain offerings; nonlagers lack such cheap options.  \n  b. Future \u201cfancy beers\u201d slated for *second stage*  \n     \u2022 Cites <invalid_quote>\u201cThe results of [fancier beers] tasting will be reported separately \u2026 Once Microsoft\u2019s \u2026 computers have \u2026\u201d</invalid_quote> (Philosophy).  \n     \u2022 Author deliberately postpones evaluation of ales/microbrews because he wants to first analyze lagers\u2019 price-quality variability.\n\n3. Positive Value Findings for Cheap Lagers  \n  a. Taste-o-meter\u00ae rewards cheapest lagers  \n     \u2022 Cites <invalid_quote>\u201cBusch \u2026 the No.1 value beer. \u2026 Milwaukee\u2019s Best and Schmidt\u2019s \u2026 are nearly Busch-like value\u201d</invalid_quote> (Data 3).  \n     \u2022 Author celebrates cheap lagers\u2019 surprising performance (\u201cnone \u2026 confessed respect \u2026 before the contest,\u201d yet they scored well).  \n  b. Snob-o-meter\u00ae confirms cheap lagers\u2019 social value  \n     \u2022 Cites <quote> The story here is the amazing snob-power-per-dollar of Busch , closely followed by Schmidt's </quote> (Data 4).  \n     \u2022 The author **recommends** cheap lagers for parties, emphasizing their social-mobility power.\n\n4. Conclusions Advocate Lagers, Not Solely \u201cWorst\u201d  \n  a. Simplified buying philosophy  \n     \u2022 Cites <invalid_quote>\u201c1) Buy Sam Adams \u2026 2) Buy Busch at all other times\u201d</invalid_quote> (Conclusions).  \n     \u2022 Both expensive and cheap lagers earn top recommendation.  \n  b. No blanket condemnation  \n     \u2022 Only Grolsch (an outlier) is singled out as a beer \u201cnot to serve,\u201d not lagers as a group.  \n     \u2022 Cites <quote> Apart from Sam Adams and Grolsch, the tasters really had trouble telling one beer from another </quote> (Conclusions)\u2014evidence of overall parity, not inherent inferiority of lagers.\n\n5. Debater_A\u2019s Position Fails on Multiple Grounds  \n  a. Misreads \u201csnobs sneer at lagers\u201d  \n     \u2022 Cites <quote>Beer snobs sneer at lagers,</quote> (Philosophy).  \n     \u2022 This is the *author\u2019s motivation* to dispel snobbery by blind tasting, not agreement with snobs.  \n  b. Ignores \u201cpublic service\u201d imperative and future fancier\u2010beer tests  \n     \u2022 If lagers were truly \u201cworst,\u201d the author would study ales first.  \n  c. Contradicts author\u2019s final recommendations  \n     \u2022 The author *recommends* lagers (Sam Adams and Busch). A true \u201cworst\u201d category would not be endorsed.\n\nConclusion  \nThe author\u2019s repeated emphasis on the lagers\u2019 diverse price tiers, the clear value findings for cheap lagers, and the plan to test \u201cfancier beers\u201d later all demonstrate that he views lagers as the key battleground precisely because they include cheap brands. His conclusions affirm *buying* lagers, not rejecting them wholesale. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that the author felt lagers would have\u2014and indeed surprisingly value\u2014more cheap brands, rather than that he thought lagers were categorically the worst beers.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Restating My Position  \n   - My answer: The author regards lagers as the *worst* beers overall\u2014\u201cwatery,\u201d undifferentiated, and only recommends one (Sam Adams) as an exception and cheap lagers solely as a reluctantly acceptable *compromise* when \u201cyou don\u2019t know better.\u201d  \n\n2. Direct Evidence of Negative Attitude  \n   a. Sneering and \u201cBad Beer\u201d Association  \n      - <quote> Beer snobs sneer at lagers, because they look so watery and because so many bad beers are in the group. </quote> (sect. 1) \u2013 The author adopts snobs\u2019 contempt, not refutes it.  \n      - He avoids \u201ctrue bargain-basement products\u201d yet claims \u201cno tester complained about a shortage of bad beer\u201d (sect. 2): implies lagers suffice *only* because they\u2019re bad.  \n   b. Worst Rankings for Premium Lagers  \n      - In Best/Worst votes, Grolsch (most expensive lager) is the *most* frequently named Worst (5/11) and is \u201cbrought up the rear\u201d in both Taste-o-meter and Snob-o-meter (sect. 4).  \n      - Miller Genuine Draft and Heineken also occupy the lowest Taste-o-meter and Snob-o-meter slots, showing *even midrange* lagers fail.  \n   c. Language of Disdain  \n      - Tasters call lagers \u201ccrap,\u201d \u201cwater,\u201d \u201cfizzy and soapy\u201d (sect. 4 descriptions). The author highlights these pejoratives repeatedly.  \n      - Tasters \u201cpanicked\u201d as they realized \u201call the lagers tasted pretty much the same\u201d (sect. 5)\u2014an epithet for dullness.  \n   d. Reluctant Recommendations as \u201cRational Compromise\u201d  \n      - Simplified buying philosophy: \u201c1) Buy Sam Adams \u2026 2) Buy Busch at all other times\u201d (sect. 5).  \n      - \u201cBusch \u2026 gives maximum taste \u2026 per dollar invested\u201d but only *per dollar*; never as a beer worthy on its own merits.  \n      - Author premises recommendation on *lack of choice*: \u201cat all other times\u201d\u2014i.e., you\u2019d buy only if you *must*.  \n\n3. Purpose of Future \u201cFancy Beers\u201d Test  \n   - \u201cSecond stage \u2026 fancier beers \u2026 results \u2026 reported separately\u201d (sect. 1).  \n   - Why devote resources to a new test if lagers were satisfactory? Because he expects nonlager styles to *actually* demonstrate quality differences that lagers could not.  \n\n4. Attack on Debater_B\u2019s Points  \n   a. Misinterprets \u201cHonest Test\u201d Rationale  \n      - <quote>lagers pose the only honest test</quote> (sect. 1) means that if even lenners fail to discriminate, the snobbery is proven *false*. The author\u2019s aim is to *debunk* lagers, not extol them.  \n   b. Public Service = Debunking Snobbery  \n      - <quote> ideal of public service requires lager coverage.</quote> (sect. 1). He wants to show that expensive lagers do *not* justify their cost. If lagers were good, no need to show that cheap ones perform equally or better.  \n   c. Value Metrics Confirm Weakness  \n      - While cheap lagers rank high on Taste-o-meter/Snob-o-meter, this is because they *cost* less; their *absolute* preference scores remain low compared to Sam Adams (sect. 4). The ratio metric disguises poor quality.  \n   d. Selective Recommendation Equals Condemnation  \n      - Only Sam Adams \u201ctruly survived the blind taste test\u201d (sect. 5). All other lagers\u2014including \u201cnearly Busch-like value \u2026\u201d\u2014are fallback options. He never suggests *buying* any other lager for taste alone.  \n   e. Absence of Nonlager Data  \n      - He withholds fancy-beer data *until later* because he anticipates that ales/IPAs will show *real* superiority, confirming that lagers were substandard.  \n\n5. Logical Consistency  \n   - A truly *positive* view of lagers would: (i) include bargain-basement lagers, (ii) skip direct blind tests (snobs already know lagers), and (iii) refrain from seeking ales later. Instead, the author does the opposite.  \n   - The experiment\u2019s *design* and *language* aim to *undermine* lager snobbery by showing how cheaply one can approximate \u201cbest\u201d taste and social cachet\u2014only to move on to the styles that genuinely satisfy snobs.  \n\nConclusion  \nBy (a) adopting snobs\u2019 negative descriptors, (b) demonstrating widespread failure of lagers except in cost-adjusted ratios, (c) offering only a single acceptable lager on merit, and (d) planning further tests of nonlagers, the author makes clear that he views lagers as the *worst* beers, unworthy except as compromises. My interpretation best explains his intent and all cited evidence; Debater_B\u2019s interpretation ignores the broader context of *debunking* snobbery and his own language of contempt.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. My Position Aligns with the Author\u2019s Explicit Purpose  \n   a. \u201cOnly honest test of the ability to tell expensive from dirt-cheap beers\u201d  \n      \u2022 The author chose lagers because they uniquely span \u201chigh end\u2026 middle\u2026 low\u201d price tiers (<invalid_quote>Through the magic of the market, lager prices\u2026fall into one of three ranges</invalid_quote> Materials \u00a72).  \n      \u2022 If lagers were simply \u201cworst,\u201d there would have been no scientific value in testing them before \u201cfancier beers,\u201d which he reserves for a future installment (<quote>The results of that tasting will be reported separately,</quote> Philosophy \u00a71).  \n   b. Public-service ethos  \n      \u2022 He explicitly states: <quote> the ideal of public service requires lager coverage. This is what most people drink, so new findings about lager quality could do the greatest good </quote> Philosophy \u00a71.  \n      \u2022 A universal condemnation of lagers contradicts this altruistic motive; instead he seeks to reveal hidden value in cheap lagers.\n\n2. The Author\u2019s Conclusions Celebrate Cheap Lagers\u2019 Surprising Value  \n   a. Taste-o-meter results  \n      \u2022 Busch, Milwaukee\u2019s Best, Schmidt\u2019s\u2014all low-cost lagers\u2014rank highest on taste-per-dollar (<quote>Busch , the No. 1 value beer</quote> Data \u00a73).  \n      \u2022 He writes: <quote>. It is safe to say that none of our testers would have confessed respect for Busch, Milwaukee's Best, or</quote> Data \u00a73, praising the experiment for overturning snobbery.  \n   b. Snob-o-meter results  \n      \u2022 Again, cheap lagers dominate social-impression per dollar: <quote> The story here is the amazing snob-power-per-dollar of Busch , closely followed by Schmidt's </quote> Data \u00a74  \n   c. Final buying recommendations  \n      \u2022 He instructs consumers: <invalid_quote>\u201c1) Buy Sam Adams when\u2026 2) Buy Busch at all other times\u201d</invalid_quote> Conclusions \u00a75.  \n      \u2022 He does not say \u201cavoid lagers\u201d; he urges consumption of both a premium lager (Sam Adams) and a budget lager (Busch).\n\n3. \u201cSam Adams\u201d Is a Special Case, Not Representative of All Lagers  \n   a. \u201cQuasi-mislabeling\u201d and atypical color (<quote>(Only one guessed it was Sam Adams.) As</quote> Data \u00a72) suggest it behaves more like a dark ale.  \n   b. The author \u201clater\u201d expects to test true ales and microbrews (<quote>Next installment: fancy beers</quote> Conclusions \u00a75), implying that genuine style-based quality differences await discovery outside the lager class.\n\n4. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cWorst of the Beers\u201d Theory Misreads Key Passages  \n   a. \u201cSnobs sneer at lagers\u201d is the *hypothesis* to be tested, not the author\u2019s stance (<quote>Beer snobs sneer at lagers,</quote> Philosophy \u00a71). The experiment reveals that snobbery is misplaced.  \n   b. The absence of \u201cbargain-basement\u201d beers and malt liquors is a limitation, not proof of contempt (<quote>no tester complained about a shortage of bad beer</quote> Materials \u00a72). They simply could not test beyond lagers\u2019 full price range.  \n   c. Midrange and high-end lagers often performed poorly, but this supports the notion of \u201cable to tell expensive from dirt-cheap\u201d; the best and worst votes clearly distinguish quality within lagers (<invalid_quote>Ten of them chose Sam Adams\u2026 Busch was the only beer to receive both a Best and a Worst vote</invalid_quote> Data \u00a71).  \n   d. The author\u2019s characterizations (\u201ccrap,\u201d \u201cwater. LITE.\u201d) are part of tasters\u2019 subjective \u201cdescription\u201d field (<quote>Description: \"Amusing presumption,\" \"fresh on the palate,\" \"crap,\" etc.</quote> Experimental procedure \u00a73), not unconditional decrees by the author.\n\n5. Logical Implications Demand Testing \u201cFancy Beers\u201d Next  \n   a. If lagers were indeed the overall worst, further testing of beers that \u201cpose the only honest test\u201d would be redundant. Instead, he postpones non-lagers awaiting future reporting.  \n   b. The author\u2019s repeated framing of the lager experiment as \u201cpublic service\u201d to mainstream drinkers presumes many consumers will benefit from knowing which lagers offer maximum value.\n\n6. Summary  \n   \u2022 The author\u2019s aim is to *evaluate* lagers\u2019 full price spectrum, highlight undervalued cheap lagers, and then move on to styles less accessible to consumers.  \n   \u2022 His ultimate advice is to *buy* lagers\u2014premium when possible (Sam Adams) and budget for everyday use (Busch).  \n   \u2022 Only by testing lagers first could he assess whether price correlates with taste and social prestige and whether the same approach will hold for fancier beers.  \n\nTherefore, the author\u2019s true attitude toward beer classifications is that lagers *must* be tested because they include the widest range of cheap to premium offerings; not that lagers are universally \u201cworst,\u201d but that they are the essential battleground to reveal real value before moving on to other styles.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
