{"metadata": {"first_debater_correct": true, "question_idx": 247, "background_text": "The Olympic Gene Pool \n\n         Why the human race keeps getting faster. \n\n                         By Andrew Berry              \n\n         ( 2,168 words; posted Thursday, July 4; to be composted Thursday, July 11 ) \n\n         On May 6, 1954, at Oxford University's Iffley Road track, Roger Bannister became, by just half a second, the first man to run a mile in less than four minutes. The Holy Grail of middle-distance running was his. Forty-two years later, however, that achievement seems less significant. Four-minute miles are commonplace; the current record, held by Algerian Noureddine Morceli, is 3:44 , more than 5 percent faster than Bannister's speed. What Iffley Road witnessed was just another step along the road to an ever quicker mile, part of the inexorable improvement of athletic performance that we usually take for granted, particularly when the Olympics roll around. If you stop to think about it, though, such constant progress is remarkable. After all, as biomechanical machines with a standard set of parts, humans should be subject to the same limitations we see in, say, automobiles. How come they aren't? \n\n         A lot of entrepreneurs and technophiles would like us to think that the answer has to do with discoveries in the world of sports technology. A new Nike shoe is trumpeted as something that will shave at least one-thousandth of a second off your 100-meter time. Trainers measure the rate of buildup of lactic acid in your muscles, then claim that their programs will control it. Nutritionists fine-tune athletes' diets. Even the old sexual-abstinence-before-the-race dogma is being re-evaluated under the all-seeing eye of science. But I consider all this little more than tinkering. Sports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the same today as they were in 1896, when the first modern Olympics took place. These minor miracles are the product neither of technology nor of training but of demographic patterns that affect us all. \n\n         Over the past century, the human race has been affected by a slew of what demographers call \"secular\" trends. (In this context, \"secular\" does not refer to a trend's lack of spirituality but to its longevity: Secular trends are long-term modifications, not just brief fluctuations.) One such trend is an increase in average size. You have to stoop to get through the doorways of a Tudor cottage in England because its inhabitants were smaller than you are, not because they had a penchant for crouching. Another trend is in life expectancy. People are living longer. Life expectancy in Africa increased over the past 20 years from 46 to 53 years. Over the same period in Europe, where things were already pretty comfortable to begin with, life expectancy increased from 71 to 75 years. The global average was an increase from 58 to 65 years. \n\n          Probably the most striking change, though, is how much more quickly children are maturing. A 12-year-old child in 1990 who was in what the World Health Organization calls \"average economic circumstances\" was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart. This is not solely the product of the first trend--the increase in average size--but also due to the fact that children develop faster. Girls menstruate earlier than they used to. The age of menarche (the onset of menstruation) has decreased by three or four months per decade in average sections of Western European populations for the past 150 years. There is a good chance that our 1990 12-year-old already had started to menstruate. Her 1900 counterpart would still have had three years to wait. \n\n         What do such trends have to do with athletic performance? Well, if we're living longer and growing up faster, that must mean we're producing bigger, better bodies. Better bodies imply faster miles. We run faster and faster for the same reason it is now common for 11-year-old girls to menstruate. But why are these things happening? \n\n          Demographers have offered a variety of explanations, but the main one is that our diet is improving. A 12-year-old ate better in 1990 than she would have in the Victorian era. This conclusion is supported by studies of the social elite: Because its members were well-nourished even in the early years of this century, this group has experienced relatively little change, over the past 100 years, in the age girls first menstruate. Another explanation is that health care is getting better. In 1991, according to the WHO, more than 75 percent of all 1-year-olds worldwide were immunized against a range of common diseases. Smallpox, that scourge of previous generations, now is effectively extinct. Probably the best measure of how much healthier we are is the rate of infant mortality, which measures both the health of the mother (a sickly mother is more likely to produce a sickly baby) and the health of the baby. In the past 20 years, infant mortality around the world has dropped from 92 deaths per 1000 live births to just 62. A lot of this can be chalked up to primary-heath-care programs in the developing world--the African average, for instance, has dropped from 135 deaths per 1000 births to 95. But there are also significant improvements in the developed world, with infant deaths dropping in Europe over the same 20-year period from 24 per 1000 live births to just 10. \n\n         Better health care affects athletic ability directly. This is true in the trivial case in which, say, antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race, but it may also be true in a more significant way. Diseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health--not necessarily a big one, but an impact nevertheless. Previous generations bore scars from all sorts of non-life-threatening diseases, the stuff everyone picked up as a baby. Nowadays, though, more and more people grow up with no history of disease. Since top athletes inevitably are drawn from the healthiest sector of the population, a generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from. You are much more likely to find someone who can run a mile in 3:30 in a sample of several million superbly healthy people than you are in a sample of 10,000. \n\n         The pool of potential athletes has expanded in other ways, too. First, the population has exploded. Second, we are coming ever closer to a worldwide middle class, the class from which athletes typically are drawn. Whether, in an age of multinational capitalism, we may talk reasonably about a post-colonial era is way beyond the scope of this article. The fact remains, however, that the developing world is doing just that--developing. Even Mozambique, which ranks at, or near, the bottom of national per capita gross national product tables, has shown an increase of some 20 percent in adult literacy rates over the past 20 years. Literacy rates are merely an index of education, which itself is another way of talking about a global move away from a hand-to-mouth lifestyle. \n\n         The decline of empire has its Olympic corollaries. Britain won, on average, 17 gold medals per Olympics in the five official games held in its imperial heyday before World War I. That average has dropped to only five medals per Olympics in the 17 held since. This is not a reflection of declining athletic standards in Britain, however; it's a function of how much more competitive other nations have become. The Olympics originally were the preserve of the socioeconomic elite of the socioeconomic elite among nations. Consider this: Only 13 nations participated in 1896, but there were 172 in 1992. Black Africans didn't take part until the third modern games, held in St. Louis in 1908. Even this was accidental: Lentauw and Yamasami, Zulu tribesmen, entered the marathon because they happened to be in St. Louis as part of an exhibit about the Boer war. Lentauw finished ninth despite being chased into a cornfield by dogs. \n\n         Since all these are changes in how we live, not anything innate, we have to conclude that what we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes. Let us assume that our 1900 and 1990 12-year-olds are identical twins magically born 90 years apart. The 1990 girl still will grow up faster, end up bigger, menstruate earlier, and live longer than the 1900 girl. Perhaps way, way back in human history, when our forebears were still fleeing saber-toothed tigers, natural selection for athletic prowess came into play. But all that ended long ago. Indeed, the laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days: Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today's top athletes have fewer children than average. \n\n          Just because nurture has a more significant effect on athletic performance doesn't mean that nature lies dormant, though. Genetic variation exists for just about any trait you choose to study, and the ability to run quickly would be no exception. To take a trivial case, we know that the inheritance of extra fingers or toes is determined genetically. It is quite possible that the possession of an extra toe would hinder an aspiring miler--their genes have affected their athletic performance. One genetic factor that may be influencing performance trends is what is known as \"hybrid vigor.\" Cattle breeders have known about this for a long time: Take two inbred lines of cattle, cross them, and what you have is \"better\" (say, larger) than any single individual in either of the two parental lines. This does not require natural selection; it is the accidental byproduct of combining two previously isolated stocks. There are a number of theories to account for this at the genetic level, but it has proved difficult to discriminate among them. It is possible that modern humans exhibit some form of hybrid vigor simply because migration and admixture of populations are now occurring at unprecedented rates. Perhaps, just perhaps, such hybridization is being translated into enhanced performance. \n\n         That doesn't mean, however, that genetic differences in athletic ability can be correlated automatically with race. That is a claim that is impossible to test, because you cannot control, in an experimental sense, environmental differences among the study groups. Sure, you will find more Africans or descendants of Africans standing on the podiums at the end of Olympic track events. And you will find far fewer Asians on those same podiums. But can you, therefore, conclude that Africans have better genes for running than Asians do? No. Environmental differences between the two groups could account for differing levels of athletic success. It is scarcely surprising that Ethiopian or Kenyan distance runners do better than everyone else, since they are in the habit of running immense distances to and from primary school, middle school, and high school. The training is what's crucial, not the blackness. The Chinese sports establishment also has carried out an enormous, and effective, experiment to help dispel the myth that race has a direct relation to athletic ability. Until recently, a quick glance at the medals table confirmed every stereotype people held about Asians and sports. Then the Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners (and swimmers), and, boy, did they ever. In 1992, China ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal haul. \n\n         You can bring a single generation up to speed through training, but the trends we're dealing with transcend individual generations. Which brings us to another question: Will there come a time when the human machine will hit some sort of natural limit and an Olympic Games pass without a single record tumbling? In principle, yes. \n\n         There are some barriers that simply cannot be broken. We will never run a mile at the same speed at which we now run 100 meters, for instance. The laws of oxygen exchange will not permit it. Race horses seem already to have hit that outer limit. For years, they were as good as human athletes at pushing back speed records, but then they simply stopped getting faster. Take the prestigious British Derby. From 1850 to 1930, winning times dropped from 2:55 to 2:39. But from 1986 to 1996, the average time has been--2:39. Unlike people, race horses are specifically bred and reared to run. Generations of careful genetic selection have ensured that today's race horse has every possible speed-enhancing characteristic. Training techniques, too, are tremendously sophisticated. But you can go only so far. You can only breed horses with ultralight thin bones to a certain point; the bones will break under stress if they get any lighter. \n\n         Human improvement, like race-horse improvement, must eventually bow to the basic constraints of biomechanics. The age of menarche cannot keep on falling forever. On the other hand, it is clear from the remarkable demographic changes of just the past 20 years that these long-term trends are with us still. They may be slowing down in some more developed societies, but they roar along in others. And these trends will continue to fuel the improvement in athletic performance. Several new records will be set in Atlanta. And in Sydney in 2000, and wherever the Olympics are held in 2044. We will continue running faster and jumping further for a good long while to come.\n", "question": "How does improved medical care impact athletic ability?", "first_debater_answer": "Directly and indirectly", "second_debater_answer": "Only directly", "debate_identifier": "The Olympic Gene Pool_How does improved medical care impact athletic ability?"}, "speeches": [{"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "The following are rules from the game of Debate.\n- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_A, Debater_B) and a Judge.

Probably the best measure of how much healthier we are is the rate of infant mortality, which measures both the health of the mother (a sickly mother is more likely to produce a sickly baby) and the health of the baby. In the past 20 years, infant mortality around the world has dropped from 92 deaths per 1000 live births to just 62. A lot of this can be chalked up to primary-heath-care programs in the developing world--the African average, for instance, has dropped from 135 deaths per 1000 births to 95. But there are also significant improvements in the developed world, with infant deaths dropping in Europe over the same 20-year period from 24 per 1000 live births to just 10. \n\n         Better health care affects athletic ability directly. This is true in the trivial case in which, say, antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race, but it may also be true in a more significant way. Diseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health--not necessarily a big one, but an impact nevertheless. Previous generations bore scars from all sorts of non-life-threatening diseases, the stuff everyone picked up as a baby. Nowadays, though, more and more people grow up with no history of disease. Since top athletes inevitably are drawn from the healthiest sector of the population, a generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from. You are much more likely to find someone who can run a mile in 3:30 in a sample of several million superbly healthy people than you are in a sample of 10,000. \n\n         The pool of potential athletes has expanded in other ways, too. First, the population has exploded. Second, we are coming ever closer to a worldwide middle class, the class from which athletes typically are drawn. Whether, in an age of multinational capitalism, we may talk reasonably about a post-colonial era is way beyond the scope of this article. The fact remains, however, that the developing world is doing just that--developing. Even Mozambique, which ranks at, or near, the bottom of national per capita gross national product tables, has shown an increase of some 20 percent in adult literacy rates over the past 20 years. Literacy rates are merely an index of education, which itself is another way of talking about a global move away from a hand-to-mouth lifestyle. \n\n         The decline of empire has its Olympic corollaries. Britain won, on average, 17 gold medals per Olympics in the five official games held in its imperial heyday before World War I. That average has dropped to only five medals per Olympics in the 17 held since. This is not a reflection of declining athletic standards in Britain, however; it's a function of how much more competitive other nations have become. The Olympics originally were the preserve of the socioeconomic elite of the socioeconomic elite among nations. Consider this: Only 13 nations participated in 1896, but there were 172 in 1992. Black Africans didn't take part until the third modern games, held in St. Louis in 1908. Even this was accidental: Lentauw and Yamasami, Zulu tribesmen, entered the marathon because they happened to be in St. Louis as part of an exhibit about the Boer war. Lentauw finished ninth despite being chased into a cornfield by dogs. \n\n         Since all these are changes in how we live, not anything innate, we have to conclude that what we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes. Let us assume that our 1900 and 1990 12-year-olds are identical twins magically born 90 years apart. The 1990 girl still will grow up faster, end up bigger, menstruate earlier, and live longer than the 1900 girl. Perhaps way, way back in human history, when our forebears were still fleeing saber-toothed tigers, natural selection for athletic prowess came into play. But all that ended long ago. Indeed, the laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days: Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today's top athletes have fewer children than average. \n\n          Just because nurture has a more significant effect on athletic performance doesn't mean that nature lies dormant, though. Genetic variation exists for just about any trait you choose to study, and the ability to run quickly would be no exception. To take a trivial case, we know that the inheritance of extra fingers or toes is determined genetically. It is quite possible that the possession of an extra toe would hinder an aspiring miler--their genes have affected their athletic performance. One genetic factor that may be influencing performance trends is what is known as \"hybrid vigor.\" Cattle breeders have known about this for a long time: Take two inbred lines of cattle, cross them, and what you have is \"better\" (say, larger) than any single individual in either of the two parental lines. This does not require natural selection; it is the accidental byproduct of combining two previously isolated stocks. There are a number of theories to account for this at the genetic level, but it has proved difficult to discriminate among them. It is possible that modern humans exhibit some form of hybrid vigor simply because migration and admixture of populations are now occurring at unprecedented rates. Perhaps, just perhaps, such hybridization is being translated into enhanced performance. \n\n         That doesn't mean, however, that genetic differences in athletic ability can be correlated automatically with race. That is a claim that is impossible to test, because you cannot control, in an experimental sense, environmental differences among the study groups. Sure, you will find more Africans or descendants of Africans standing on the podiums at the end of Olympic track events. And you will find far fewer Asians on those same podiums. But can you, therefore, conclude that Africans have better genes for running than Asians do? No. Environmental differences between the two groups could account for differing levels of athletic success. It is scarcely surprising that Ethiopian or Kenyan distance runners do better than everyone else, since they are in the habit of running immense distances to and from primary school, middle school, and high school. The training is what's crucial, not the blackness. The Chinese sports establishment also has carried out an enormous, and effective, experiment to help dispel the myth that race has a direct relation to athletic ability. Until recently, a quick glance at the medals table confirmed every stereotype people held about Asians and sports. Then the Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners (and swimmers), and, boy, did they ever. In 1992, China ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal haul. \n\n         You can bring a single generation up to speed through training, but the trends we're dealing with transcend individual generations. Which brings us to another question: Will there come a time when the human machine will hit some sort of natural limit and an Olympic Games pass without a single record tumbling? In principle, yes. \n\n         There are some barriers that simply cannot be broken. We will never run a mile at the same speed at which we now run 100 meters, for instance. The laws of oxygen exchange will not permit it. Race horses seem already to have hit that outer limit. For years, they were as good as human athletes at pushing back speed records, but then they simply stopped getting faster. Take the prestigious British Derby. From 1850 to 1930, winning times dropped from 2:55 to 2:39. But from 1986 to 1996, the average time has been--2:39. Unlike people, race horses are specifically bred and reared to run. Generations of careful genetic selection have ensured that today's race horse has every possible speed-enhancing characteristic. Training techniques, too, are tremendously sophisticated. But you can go only so far. You can only breed horses with ultralight thin bones to a certain point; the bones will break under stress if they get any lighter. \n\n         Human improvement, like race-horse improvement, must eventually bow to the basic constraints of biomechanics. The age of menarche cannot keep on falling forever. On the other hand, it is clear from the remarkable demographic changes of just the past 20 years that these long-term trends are with us still. They may be slowing down in some more developed societies, but they roar along in others. And these trends will continue to fuel the improvement in athletic performance. Several new records will be set in Atlanta. And in Sydney in 2000, and wherever the Olympics are held in 2044. We will continue running faster and jumping further for a good long while to come.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow does improved medical care impact athletic ability?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Only directly\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Directly and indirectly\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Directly and indirectly\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Directly and indirectly\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "Argument for \u201cOnly Directly\u201d  (Debater_B)\n\n1.

The Holy Grail of middle-distance running was his. Forty-two years later, however, that achievement seems less significant. Four-minute miles are commonplace; the current record, held by Algerian Noureddine Morceli, is 3:44 , more than 5 percent faster than Bannister's speed. What Iffley Road witnessed was just another step along the road to an ever quicker mile, part of the inexorable improvement of athletic performance that we usually take for granted, particularly when the Olympics roll around. If you stop to think about it, though, such constant progress is remarkable. After all, as biomechanical machines with a standard set of parts, humans should be subject to the same limitations we see in, say, automobiles. How come they aren't? \n\n         A lot of entrepreneurs and technophiles would like us to think that the answer has to do with discoveries in the world of sports technology. A new Nike shoe is trumpeted as something that will shave at least one-thousandth of a second off your 100-meter time. Trainers measure the rate of buildup of lactic acid in your muscles, then claim that their programs will control it. Nutritionists fine-tune athletes' diets. Even the old sexual-abstinence-before-the-race dogma is being re-evaluated under the all-seeing eye of science. But I consider all this little more than tinkering. Sports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the same today as they were in 1896, when the first modern Olympics took place. These minor miracles are the product neither of technology nor of training but of demographic patterns that affect us all. \n\n         Over the past century, the human race has been affected by a slew of what demographers call \"secular\" trends. (In this context, \"secular\" does not refer to a trend's lack of spirituality but to its longevity: Secular trends are long-term modifications, not just brief fluctuations.) One such trend is an increase in average size. You have to stoop to get through the doorways of a Tudor cottage in England because its inhabitants were smaller than you are, not because they had a penchant for crouching. Another trend is in life expectancy. People are living longer. Life expectancy in Africa increased over the past 20 years from 46 to 53 years. Over the same period in Europe, where things were already pretty comfortable to begin with, life expectancy increased from 71 to 75 years. The global average was an increase from 58 to 65 years. \n\n          Probably the most striking change, though, is how much more quickly children are maturing. A 12-year-old child in 1990 who was in what the World Health Organization calls \"average economic circumstances\" was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart. This is not solely the product of the first trend--the increase in average size--but also due to the fact that children develop faster. Girls menstruate earlier than they used to. The age of menarche (the onset of menstruation) has decreased by three or four months per decade in average sections of Western European populations for the past 150 years. There is a good chance that our 1990 12-year-old already had started to menstruate. Her 1900 counterpart would still have had three years to wait. \n\n         What do such trends have to do with athletic performance? Well, if we're living longer and growing up faster, that must mean we're producing bigger, better bodies. Better bodies imply faster miles. We run faster and faster for the same reason it is now common for 11-year-old girls to menstruate. But why are these things happening? \n\n          Demographers have offered a variety of explanations, but the main one is that our diet is improving. A 12-year-old ate better in 1990 than she would have in the Victorian era. This conclusion is supported by studies of the social elite: Because its members were well-nourished even in the early years of this century, this group has experienced relatively little change, over the past 100 years, in the age girls first menstruate. Another explanation is that health care is getting better. In 1991, according to the WHO, more than 75 percent of all 1-year-olds worldwide were immunized against a range of common diseases. Smallpox, that scourge of previous generations, now is effectively extinct. Probably the best measure of how much healthier we are is the rate of infant mortality, which measures both the health of the mother (a sickly mother is more likely to produce a sickly baby) and the health of the baby. In the past 20 years, infant mortality around the world has dropped from 92 deaths per 1000 live births to just 62. A lot of this can be chalked up to primary-heath-care programs in the developing world--the African average, for instance, has dropped from 135 deaths per 1000 births to 95. But there are also significant improvements in the developed world, with infant deaths dropping in Europe over the same 20-year period from 24 per 1000 live births to just 10. \n\n         Better health care affects athletic ability directly. This is true in the trivial case in which, say, antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race, but it may also be true in a more significant way. Diseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health--not necessarily a big one, but an impact nevertheless. Previous generations bore scars from all sorts of non-life-threatening diseases, the stuff everyone picked up as a baby. Nowadays, though, more and more people grow up with no history of disease. Since top athletes inevitably are drawn from the healthiest sector of the population, a generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from. You are much more likely to find someone who can run a mile in 3:30 in a sample of several million superbly healthy people than you are in a sample of 10,000. \n\n         The pool of potential athletes has expanded in other ways, too. First, the population has exploded. Second, we are coming ever closer to a worldwide middle class, the class from which athletes typically are drawn. Whether, in an age of multinational capitalism, we may talk reasonably about a post-colonial era is way beyond the scope of this article. The fact remains, however, that the developing world is doing just that--developing. Even Mozambique, which ranks at, or near, the bottom of national per capita gross national product tables, has shown an increase of some 20 percent in adult literacy rates over the past 20 years. Literacy rates are merely an index of education, which itself is another way of talking about a global move away from a hand-to-mouth lifestyle. \n\n         The decline of empire has its Olympic corollaries. Britain won, on average, 17 gold medals per Olympics in the five official games held in its imperial heyday before World War I. That average has dropped to only five medals per Olympics in the 17 held since. This is not a reflection of declining athletic standards in Britain, however; it's a function of how much more competitive other nations have become.

Lentauw finished ninth despite being chased into a cornfield by dogs. \n\n         Since all these are changes in how we live, not anything innate, we have to conclude that what we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes. Let us assume that our 1900 and 1990 12-year-olds are identical twins magically born 90 years apart. The 1990 girl still will grow up faster, end up bigger, menstruate earlier, and live longer than the 1900 girl.

The Holy Grail of middle-distance running was his. Forty-two years later, however, that achievement seems less significant. Four-minute miles are commonplace; the current record, held by Algerian Noureddine Morceli, is 3:44 , more than 5 percent faster than Bannister's speed. What Iffley Road witnessed was just another step along the road to an ever quicker mile, part of the inexorable improvement of athletic performance that we usually take for granted, particularly when the Olympics roll around. If you stop to think about it, though, such constant progress is remarkable. After all, as biomechanical machines with a standard set of parts, humans should be subject to the same limitations we see in, say, automobiles. How come they aren't? \n\n         A lot of entrepreneurs and technophiles would like us to think that the answer has to do with discoveries in the world of sports technology. A new Nike shoe is trumpeted as something that will shave at least one-thousandth of a second off your 100-meter time. Trainers measure the rate of buildup of lactic acid in your muscles, then claim that their programs will control it. Nutritionists fine-tune athletes' diets. Even the old sexual-abstinence-before-the-race dogma is being re-evaluated under the all-seeing eye of science. But I consider all this little more than tinkering. Sports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the same today as they were in 1896, when the first modern Olympics took place. These minor miracles are the product neither of technology nor of training but of demographic patterns that affect us all. \n\n         Over the past century, the human race has been affected by a slew of what demographers call \"secular\" trends. (In this context, \"secular\" does not refer to a trend's lack of spirituality but to its longevity: Secular trends are long-term modifications, not just brief fluctuations.) One such trend is an increase in average size. You have to stoop to get through the doorways of a Tudor cottage in England because its inhabitants were smaller than you are, not because they had a penchant for crouching. Another trend is in life expectancy. People are living longer. Life expectancy in Africa increased over the past 20 years from 46 to 53 years. Over the same period in Europe, where things were already pretty comfortable to begin with, life expectancy increased from 71 to 75 years. The global average was an increase from 58 to 65 years. \n\n          Probably the most striking change, though, is how much more quickly children are maturing. A 12-year-old child in 1990 who was in what the World Health Organization calls \"average economic circumstances\" was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart. This is not solely the product of the first trend--the increase in average size--but also due to the fact that children develop faster. Girls menstruate earlier than they used to. The age of menarche (the onset of menstruation) has decreased by three or four months per decade in average sections of Western European populations for the past 150 years. There is a good chance that our 1990 12-year-old already had started to menstruate. Her 1900 counterpart would still have had three years to wait. \n\n         What do such trends have to do with athletic performance? Well, if we're living longer and growing up faster, that must mean we're producing bigger, better bodies. Better bodies imply faster miles. We run faster and faster for the same reason it is now common for 11-year-old girls to menstruate. But why are these things happening? \n\n          Demographers have offered a variety of explanations, but the main one is that our diet is improving. A 12-year-old ate better in 1990 than she would have in the Victorian era. This conclusion is supported by studies of the social elite: Because its members were well-nourished even in the early years of this century, this group has experienced relatively little change, over the past 100 years, in the age girls first menstruate. Another explanation is that health care is getting better. In 1991, according to the WHO, more than 75 percent of all 1-year-olds worldwide were immunized against a range of common diseases. Smallpox, that scourge of previous generations, now is effectively extinct. Probably the best measure of how much healthier we are is the rate of infant mortality, which measures both the health of the mother (a sickly mother is more likely to produce a sickly baby) and the health of the baby. In the past 20 years, infant mortality around the world has dropped from 92 deaths per 1000 live births to just 62. A lot of this can be chalked up to primary-heath-care programs in the developing world--the African average, for instance, has dropped from 135 deaths per 1000 births to 95. But there are also significant improvements in the developed world, with infant deaths dropping in Europe over the same 20-year period from 24 per 1000 live births to just 10. \n\n         Better health care affects athletic ability directly. This is true in the trivial case in which, say, antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race, but it may also be true in a more significant way. Diseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health--not necessarily a big one, but an impact nevertheless. Previous generations bore scars from all sorts of non-life-threatening diseases, the stuff everyone picked up as a baby. Nowadays, though, more and more people grow up with no history of disease. Since top athletes inevitably are drawn from the healthiest sector of the population, a generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from. You are much more likely to find someone who can run a mile in 3:30 in a sample of several million superbly healthy people than you are in a sample of 10,000. \n\n         The pool of potential athletes has expanded in other ways, too. First, the population has exploded. Second, we are coming ever closer to a worldwide middle class, the class from which athletes typically are drawn. Whether, in an age of multinational capitalism, we may talk reasonably about a post-colonial era is way beyond the scope of this article. The fact remains, however, that the developing world is doing just that--developing. Even Mozambique, which ranks at, or near, the bottom of national per capita gross national product tables, has shown an increase of some 20 percent in adult literacy rates over the past 20 years. Literacy rates are merely an index of education, which itself is another way of talking about a global move away from a hand-to-mouth lifestyle. \n\n         The decline of empire has its Olympic corollaries. Britain won, on average, 17 gold medals per Olympics in the five official games held in its imperial heyday before World War I. That average has dropped to only five medals per Olympics in the 17 held since. This is not a reflection of declining athletic standards in Britain, however; it's a function of how much more competitive other nations have become. The Olympics originally were the preserve of the socioeconomic elite of the socioeconomic elite among nations. Consider this: Only 13 nations participated in 1896, but there were 172 in 1992. Black Africans didn't take part until the third modern games, held in St. Louis in 1908. Even this was accidental: Lentauw and Yamasami, Zulu tribesmen, entered the marathon because they happened to be in St. Louis as part of an exhibit about the Boer war. Lentauw finished ninth despite being chased into a cornfield by dogs. \n\n         Since all these are changes in how we live, not anything innate, we have to conclude that what we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes. Let us assume that our 1900 and 1990 12-year-olds are identical twins magically born 90 years apart. The 1990 girl still will grow up faster, end up bigger, menstruate earlier, and live longer than the 1900 girl. Perhaps way, way back in human history, when our forebears were still fleeing saber-toothed tigers, natural selection for athletic prowess came into play. But all that ended long ago. Indeed, the laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days: Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today's top athletes have fewer children than average. \n\n          Just because nurture has a more significant effect on athletic performance doesn't mean that nature lies dormant, though. Genetic variation exists for just about any trait you choose to study, and the ability to run quickly would be no exception. To take a trivial case, we know that the inheritance of extra fingers or toes is determined genetically. It is quite possible that the possession of an extra toe would hinder an aspiring miler--their genes have affected their athletic performance. One genetic factor that may be influencing performance trends is what is known as \"hybrid vigor.\" Cattle breeders have known about this for a long time: Take two inbred lines of cattle, cross them, and what you have is \"better\" (say, larger) than any single individual in either of the two parental lines. This does not require natural selection; it is the accidental byproduct of combining two previously isolated stocks. There are a number of theories to account for this at the genetic level, but it has proved difficult to discriminate among them. It is possible that modern humans exhibit some form of hybrid vigor simply because migration and admixture of populations are now occurring at unprecedented rates. Perhaps, just perhaps, such hybridization is being translated into enhanced performance. \n\n         That doesn't mean, however, that genetic differences in athletic ability can be correlated automatically with race. That is a claim that is impossible to test, because you cannot control, in an experimental sense, environmental differences among the study groups. Sure, you will find more Africans or descendants of Africans standing on the podiums at the end of Olympic track events. And you will find far fewer Asians on those same podiums. But can you, therefore, conclude that Africans have better genes for running than Asians do? No. Environmental differences between the two groups could account for differing levels of athletic success. It is scarcely surprising that Ethiopian or Kenyan distance runners do better than everyone else, since they are in the habit of running immense distances to and from primary school, middle school, and high school. The training is what's crucial, not the blackness. The Chinese sports establishment also has carried out an enormous, and effective, experiment to help dispel the myth that race has a direct relation to athletic ability. Until recently, a quick glance at the medals table confirmed every stereotype people held about Asians and sports. Then the Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners (and swimmers), and, boy, did they ever. In 1992, China ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal haul. \n\n         You can bring a single generation up to speed through training, but the trends we're dealing with transcend individual generations. Which brings us to another question: Will there come a time when the human machine will hit some sort of natural limit and an Olympic Games pass without a single record tumbling? In principle, yes. \n\n         There are some barriers that simply cannot be broken. We will never run a mile at the same speed at which we now run 100 meters, for instance. The laws of oxygen exchange will not permit it. Race horses seem already to have hit that outer limit. For years, they were as good as human athletes at pushing back speed records, but then they simply stopped getting faster. Take the prestigious British Derby. From 1850 to 1930, winning times dropped from 2:55 to 2:39. But from 1986 to 1996, the average time has been--2:39. Unlike people, race horses are specifically bred and reared to run. Generations of careful genetic selection have ensured that today's race horse has every possible speed-enhancing characteristic. Training techniques, too, are tremendously sophisticated. But you can go only so far. You can only breed horses with ultralight thin bones to a certain point; the bones will break under stress if they get any lighter. \n\n         Human improvement, like race-horse improvement, must eventually bow to the basic constraints of biomechanics. The age of menarche cannot keep on falling forever. On the other hand, it is clear from the remarkable demographic changes of just the past 20 years that these long-term trends are with us still. They may be slowing down in some more developed societies, but they roar along in others. And these trends will continue to fuel the improvement in athletic performance. Several new records will be set in Atlanta. And in Sydney in 2000, and wherever the Olympics are held in 2044. We will continue running faster and jumping further for a good long while to come.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow does improved medical care impact athletic ability?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Only directly\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Directly and indirectly\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Directly and indirectly\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Position: Improved medical care enhances athletic ability both directly and indirectly.  \n   - Direct effects: Curing illnesses and reducing disease burden in individuals improves immediate athletic performance.  \n   - Indirect effects: Better health care throughout infancy and childhood raises the overall quality and size of the athlete pool, accelerates maturation, increases life expectancy, and fosters secular demographic trends that yield bigger, faster bodies over generations.  \n\n2. Direct Effects (uncontested):  \n   Claim 1. \u201cAntibiotics cure a runner\u2019s fever before the big race\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cIn the trivial case\u2026antibiotics cure a runner\u2019s fever\u201d</invalid_quote>). This clearly demonstrates a direct, immediate benefit to performance.  \n   Claim 2. Prevention of chronic sequelae from infancy diseases: \u201cDiseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cPrevious generations bore scars\u2026Nowadays\u2026grow up with no history of disease\u201d</invalid_quote>). Athletes drawn from the healthiest segment reap direct benefits.  \n\n3. Indirect Effects via Population and Demographics:  \n   Claim 3. Expanded athlete pool: \u201cYou are much more likely to find someone who can run a mile in 3:30 in a sample of several million superbly healthy people than you are in a sample of 10,000\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cSince top athletes\u2026sample of several million\u201d</invalid_quote>). Better medical care reduces infant mortality globally (from 92 to 62 per 1000), increasing the pool in developing nations (<invalid_quote>\u201cInfant mortality\u2026from 92 to 62\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n   Claim 4. Secular trends in maturation and size: Those long-term improvements (\u201cchildren develop faster,\u201d \u201c12-year-old\u20269 inches taller,\u201d \u201cmenarche earlier\u201d) are driven primarily by nutrition and health care, not genetics (<invalid_quote>\u201cBecause its members were well-nourished\u2026relatively little change\u201d</invalid_quote>). Faster maturation produces earlier peak performance and extends competitive careers, cumulatively raising record thresholds.  \n   Claim 5. Global middle class emergence: Better education and health care fuel socioeconomic development, bringing new talent into training regimens (<invalid_quote>\u201cLiteracy rates\u2026global move away from hand-to-mouth lifestyle\u201d</invalid_quote>). The Olympic field grew from 13 to 172 nations, diversifying and intensifying competition.  \n\n4. Evidence from Race Horses Analogy:  \n   \u2013 Race horses with intense genetic selection and training plateaued despite \u201ctremendously sophisticated\u201d care (<quote>2:39. But from 1986 to 1996, the average time has been--2:39.</quote>). Humans, by contrast, have yet to hit such limits because secular improvements persist in many regions, implying demographic/environmental factors drive ongoing gains.  \n\n5. Rebuttal of \u201cOnly Direct\u201d (Debater_B):  \n   Objection 1. Fails to explain long-term generational improvements: Direct treatment cannot account for 5% improvement over 42 years (<invalid_quote>\u201cMorceli\u20263:44, more than 5% faster than Bannister\u201d</invalid_quote>) without changes in the athlete pool or early-life health.  \n   Objection 2. Ignores infant mortality and maturation trends: Without \u201csecular\u201d demographic effects, why would children be 9 inches taller at age 12 or mature faster? Direct care at race time cannot influence childhood growth rates decades earlier.  \n   Objection 3. Contradicts observation that in societies with stable elite nutrition (social elite), little change in maturation occurred (<invalid_quote>\u201cSocial elite\u2026relatively little change\u2026first menarche\u201d</invalid_quote>). Only populations experiencing health care advances show performance gains.  \n   Objection 4. Neglects hybrid vigor: Increased migration and admixture foster genetic diversity, but this accidental benefit depends on lower disease burdens and higher survival\u2014an indirect product of better medical care.  \n\n6. Conclusion:  \n   Improved medical care\u2019s role extends far beyond treating athletes immediately before competition. By reducing infant and childhood disease, lowering mortality, and enabling secular trends in size and maturation, it reshapes the human gene pool and environment, fueling continued athletic improvement. Only a \u201cDirect and Indirect\u201d account coherently explains both immediate performance gains and the century-long rise in world-class speeds.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cOnly Directly\u201d  (Debater_B)\n\n1. Definition and Scope  \n  a. \u201cDirect\u201d effects of medical care: curing illness, preventing infections, enabling athletes to train and compete at full health.  \n  b. \u201cIndirect\u201d effects (per Debater_A) would require influencing genetics or long\u2010term physical development\u2014by relaxing selection or altering maturation rates.  \n\n2. Medical Care\u2019s Direct Impact  \n  a. <quote>trivial case in which, say, antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race,</quote> shows that medical treatment immediately restores an athlete\u2019s capability.  \n  b. Preventing childhood diseases avoids acute impairment that otherwise would reduce muscle or cardiovascular development, allowing the individual to train to genetic potential.\n\n3. Lack of Evidence for Indirect Genetic Improvement  \n  a. Medical care reduces infant/child mortality but by preserving individuals regardless of athletic potential, it actually weakens natural selection for speed.  \n     \u2013 <invalid_quote>\u201cLaws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days\u2026 top athletes have fewer children than average.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  b. Race\u2010horse analogy: despite intensive breeding and care, horses have \u201chit that outer limit\u201d of speed.

The Holy Grail of middle-distance running was his. Forty-two years later, however, that achievement seems less significant. Four-minute miles are commonplace; the current record, held by Algerian Noureddine Morceli, is 3:44 , more than 5 percent faster than Bannister's speed. What Iffley Road witnessed was just another step along the road to an ever quicker mile, part of the inexorable improvement of athletic performance that we usually take for granted, particularly when the Olympics roll around. If you stop to think about it, though, such constant progress is remarkable. After all, as biomechanical machines with a standard set of parts, humans should be subject to the same limitations we see in, say, automobiles. How come they aren't? \n\n         A lot of entrepreneurs and technophiles would like us to think that the answer has to do with discoveries in the world of sports technology. A new Nike shoe is trumpeted as something that will shave at least one-thousandth of a second off your 100-meter time. Trainers measure the rate of buildup of lactic acid in your muscles, then claim that their programs will control it. Nutritionists fine-tune athletes' diets. Even the old sexual-abstinence-before-the-race dogma is being re-evaluated under the all-seeing eye of science. But I consider all this little more than tinkering. Sports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the same today as they were in 1896, when the first modern Olympics took place. These minor miracles are the product neither of technology nor of training but of demographic patterns that affect us all. \n\n         Over the past century, the human race has been affected by a slew of what demographers call \"secular\" trends. (In this context, \"secular\" does not refer to a trend's lack of spirituality but to its longevity: Secular trends are long-term modifications, not just brief fluctuations.) One such trend is an increase in average size. You have to stoop to get through the doorways of a Tudor cottage in England because its inhabitants were smaller than you are, not because they had a penchant for crouching. Another trend is in life expectancy. People are living longer. Life expectancy in Africa increased over the past 20 years from 46 to 53 years. Over the same period in Europe, where things were already pretty comfortable to begin with, life expectancy increased from 71 to 75 years. The global average was an increase from 58 to 65 years. \n\n          Probably the most striking change, though, is how much more quickly children are maturing. A 12-year-old child in 1990 who was in what the World Health Organization calls \"average economic circumstances\" was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart. This is not solely the product of the first trend--the increase in average size--but also due to the fact that children develop faster. Girls menstruate earlier than they used to. The age of menarche (the onset of menstruation) has decreased by three or four months per decade in average sections of Western European populations for the past 150 years. There is a good chance that our 1990 12-year-old already had started to menstruate. Her 1900 counterpart would still have had three years to wait. \n\n         What do such trends have to do with athletic performance? Well, if we're living longer and growing up faster, that must mean we're producing bigger, better bodies. Better bodies imply faster miles. We run faster and faster for the same reason it is now common for 11-year-old girls to menstruate. But why are these things happening? \n\n          Demographers have offered a variety of explanations, but the main one is that our diet is improving. A 12-year-old ate better in 1990 than she would have in the Victorian era. This conclusion is supported by studies of the social elite: Because its members were well-nourished even in the early years of this century, this group has experienced relatively little change, over the past 100 years, in the age girls first menstruate. Another explanation is that health care is getting better. In 1991, according to the WHO, more than 75 percent of all 1-year-olds worldwide were immunized against a range of common diseases. Smallpox, that scourge of previous generations, now is effectively extinct. Probably the best measure of how much healthier we are is the rate of infant mortality, which measures both the health of the mother (a sickly mother is more likely to produce a sickly baby) and the health of the baby. In the past 20 years, infant mortality around the world has dropped from 92 deaths per 1000 live births to just 62. A lot of this can be chalked up to primary-heath-care programs in the developing world--the African average, for instance, has dropped from 135 deaths per 1000 births to 95. But there are also significant improvements in the developed world, with infant deaths dropping in Europe over the same 20-year period from 24 per 1000 live births to just 10. \n\n         Better health care affects athletic ability directly. This is true in the trivial case in which, say, antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race, but it may also be true in a more significant way. Diseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health--not necessarily a big one, but an impact nevertheless. Previous generations bore scars from all sorts of non-life-threatening diseases, the stuff everyone picked up as a baby. Nowadays, though, more and more people grow up with no history of disease. Since top athletes inevitably are drawn from the healthiest sector of the population, a generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from. You are much more likely to find someone who can run a mile in 3:30 in a sample of several million superbly healthy people than you are in a sample of 10,000. \n\n         The pool of potential athletes has expanded in other ways, too. First, the population has exploded. Second, we are coming ever closer to a worldwide middle class, the class from which athletes typically are drawn. Whether, in an age of multinational capitalism, we may talk reasonably about a post-colonial era is way beyond the scope of this article. The fact remains, however, that the developing world is doing just that--developing. Even Mozambique, which ranks at, or near, the bottom of national per capita gross national product tables, has shown an increase of some 20 percent in adult literacy rates over the past 20 years. Literacy rates are merely an index of education, which itself is another way of talking about a global move away from a hand-to-mouth lifestyle. \n\n         The decline of empire has its Olympic corollaries. Britain won, on average, 17 gold medals per Olympics in the five official games held in its imperial heyday before World War I. That average has dropped to only five medals per Olympics in the 17 held since. This is not a reflection of declining athletic standards in Britain, however; it's a function of how much more competitive other nations have become. The Olympics originally were the preserve of the socioeconomic elite of the socioeconomic elite among nations. Consider this: Only 13 nations participated in 1896, but there were 172 in 1992. Black Africans didn't take part until the third modern games, held in St. Louis in 1908. Even this was accidental: Lentauw and Yamasami, Zulu tribesmen, entered the marathon because they happened to be in St. Louis as part of an exhibit about the Boer war. Lentauw finished ninth despite being chased into a cornfield by dogs. \n\n         Since all these are changes in how we live, not anything innate, we have to conclude that what we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes. Let us assume that our 1900 and 1990 12-year-olds are identical twins magically born 90 years apart. The 1990 girl still will grow up faster, end up bigger, menstruate earlier, and live longer than the 1900 girl. Perhaps way, way back in human history, when our forebears were still fleeing saber-toothed tigers, natural selection for athletic prowess came into play. But all that ended long ago. Indeed, the laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days: Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today's top athletes have fewer children than average. \n\n          Just because nurture has a more significant effect on athletic performance doesn't mean that nature lies dormant, though. Genetic variation exists for just about any trait you choose to study, and the ability to run quickly would be no exception. To take a trivial case, we know that the inheritance of extra fingers or toes is determined genetically. It is quite possible that the possession of an extra toe would hinder an aspiring miler--their genes have affected their athletic performance. One genetic factor that may be influencing performance trends is what is known as \"hybrid vigor.\" Cattle breeders have known about this for a long time: Take two inbred lines of cattle, cross them, and what you have is \"better\" (say, larger) than any single individual in either of the two parental lines. This does not require natural selection; it is the accidental byproduct of combining two previously isolated stocks. There are a number of theories to account for this at the genetic level, but it has proved difficult to discriminate among them. It is possible that modern humans exhibit some form of hybrid vigor simply because migration and admixture of populations are now occurring at unprecedented rates. Perhaps, just perhaps, such hybridization is being translated into enhanced performance. \n\n         That doesn't mean, however, that genetic differences in athletic ability can be correlated automatically with race. That is a claim that is impossible to test, because you cannot control, in an experimental sense, environmental differences among the study groups. Sure, you will find more Africans or descendants of Africans standing on the podiums at the end of Olympic track events. And you will find far fewer Asians on those same podiums. But can you, therefore, conclude that Africans have better genes for running than Asians do? No. Environmental differences between the two groups could account for differing levels of athletic success. It is scarcely surprising that Ethiopian or Kenyan distance runners do better than everyone else, since they are in the habit of running immense distances to and from primary school, middle school, and high school. The training is what's crucial, not the blackness. The Chinese sports establishment also has carried out an enormous, and effective, experiment to help dispel the myth that race has a direct relation to athletic ability. Until recently, a quick glance at the medals table confirmed every stereotype people held about Asians and sports. Then the Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners (and swimmers), and, boy, did they ever. In 1992, China ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal haul. \n\n         You can bring a single generation up to speed through training, but the trends we're dealing with transcend individual generations. Which brings us to another question: Will there come a time when the human machine will hit some sort of natural limit and an Olympic Games pass without a single record tumbling? In principle, yes. \n\n         There are some barriers that simply cannot be broken. We will never run a mile at the same speed at which we now run 100 meters, for instance. The laws of oxygen exchange will not permit it. Race horses seem already to have hit that outer limit. For years, they were as good as human athletes at pushing back speed records, but then they simply stopped getting faster. Take the prestigious British Derby. From 1850 to 1930, winning times dropped from 2:55 to 2:39. But from 1986 to 1996, the average time has been--2:39. Unlike people, race horses are specifically bred and reared to run. Generations of careful genetic selection have ensured that today's race horse has every possible speed-enhancing characteristic. Training techniques, too, are tremendously sophisticated. But you can go only so far. You can only breed horses with ultralight thin bones to a certain point; the bones will break under stress if they get any lighter. \n\n         Human improvement, like race-horse improvement, must eventually bow to the basic constraints of biomechanics. The age of menarche cannot keep on falling forever. On the other hand, it is clear from the remarkable demographic changes of just the past 20 years that these long-term trends are with us still. They may be slowing down in some more developed societies, but they roar along in others. And these trends will continue to fuel the improvement in athletic performance. Several new records will be set in Atlanta. And in Sydney in 2000, and wherever the Olympics are held in 2044. We will continue running faster and jumping further for a good long while to come.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow does improved medical care impact athletic ability?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Directly and indirectly\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Only directly\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Only directly\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cOnly Directly\u201d  (Debater_B)\n\n1.

My Position: Improved medical care enhances athletic ability both directly and indirectly.  \n   - Direct effects: Curing illnesses and reducing disease burden in individuals improves immediate athletic performance.  \n   - Indirect effects: Better health care throughout infancy and childhood raises the overall quality and size of the athlete pool, accelerates maturation, increases life expectancy, and fosters secular demographic trends that yield bigger, faster bodies over generations.  \n\n2. Direct Effects (uncontested):  \n   Claim 1. \u201cAntibiotics cure a runner\u2019s fever before the big race\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cIn the trivial case\u2026antibiotics cure a runner\u2019s fever\u201d</invalid_quote>). This clearly demonstrates a direct, immediate benefit to performance.  \n   Claim 2. Prevention of chronic sequelae from infancy diseases: \u201cDiseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cPrevious generations bore scars\u2026Nowadays\u2026grow up with no history of disease\u201d</invalid_quote>). Athletes drawn from the healthiest segment reap direct benefits.  \n\n3. Indirect Effects via Population and Demographics:  \n   Claim 3. Expanded athlete pool: \u201cYou are much more likely to find someone who can run a mile in 3:30 in a sample of several million superbly healthy people than you are in a sample of 10,000\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cSince top athletes\u2026sample of several million\u201d</invalid_quote>). Better medical care reduces infant mortality globally (from 92 to 62 per 1000), increasing the pool in developing nations (<invalid_quote>\u201cInfant mortality\u2026from 92 to 62\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n   Claim 4. Secular trends in maturation and size: Those long-term improvements (\u201cchildren develop faster,\u201d \u201c12-year-old\u20269 inches taller,\u201d \u201cmenarche earlier\u201d) are driven primarily by nutrition and health care, not genetics (<invalid_quote>\u201cBecause its members were well-nourished\u2026relatively little change\u201d</invalid_quote>). Faster maturation produces earlier peak performance and extends competitive careers, cumulatively raising record thresholds.  \n   Claim 5. Global middle class emergence: Better education and health care fuel socioeconomic development, bringing new talent into training regimens (<invalid_quote>\u201cLiteracy rates\u2026global move away from hand-to-mouth lifestyle\u201d</invalid_quote>). The Olympic field grew from 13 to 172 nations, diversifying and intensifying competition.  \n\n4. Evidence from Race Horses Analogy:  \n   \u2013 Race horses with intense genetic selection and training plateaued despite \u201ctremendously sophisticated\u201d care (<quote>2:39. But from 1986 to 1996, the average time has been--2:39.</quote>). Humans, by contrast, have yet to hit such limits because secular improvements persist in many regions, implying demographic/environmental factors drive ongoing gains.  \n\n5. Rebuttal of \u201cOnly Direct\u201d (Debater_B):  \n   Objection 1. Fails to explain long-term generational improvements: Direct treatment cannot account for 5% improvement over 42 years (<invalid_quote>\u201cMorceli\u20263:44, more than 5% faster than Bannister\u201d</invalid_quote>) without changes in the athlete pool or early-life health.  \n   Objection 2. Ignores infant mortality and maturation trends: Without \u201csecular\u201d demographic effects, why would children be 9 inches taller at age 12 or mature faster? Direct care at race time cannot influence childhood growth rates decades earlier.  \n   Objection 3. Contradicts observation that in societies with stable elite nutrition (social elite), little change in maturation occurred (<invalid_quote>\u201cSocial elite\u2026relatively little change\u2026first menarche\u201d</invalid_quote>). Only populations experiencing health care advances show performance gains.  \n   Objection 4. Neglects hybrid vigor: Increased migration and admixture foster genetic diversity, but this accidental benefit depends on lower disease burdens and higher survival\u2014an indirect product of better medical care.  \n\n6. Conclusion:  \n   Improved medical care\u2019s role extends far beyond treating athletes immediately before competition. By reducing infant and childhood disease, lowering mortality, and enabling secular trends in size and maturation, it reshapes the human gene pool and environment, fueling continued athletic improvement. Only a \u201cDirect and Indirect\u201d account coherently explains both immediate performance gains and the century-long rise in world-class speeds.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Only directly\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "Now it is the time for a decision.

Only a \u201cDirect and Indirect\u201d account coherently explains both immediate performance gains and the century-long rise in world-class speeds.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cOnly Directly\u201d  (Debater_B)\n\n1. Definition and Scope  \n  a. \u201cDirect\u201d effects of medical care: curing illness, preventing infections, enabling athletes to train and compete at full health.  \n  b. \u201cIndirect\u201d effects (per Debater_A) would require influencing genetics or long\u2010term physical development\u2014by relaxing selection or altering maturation rates.  \n\n2. Medical Care\u2019s Direct Impact  \n  a. <quote>trivial case in which, say, antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race,</quote> shows that medical treatment immediately restores an athlete\u2019s capability.  \n  b. Preventing childhood diseases avoids acute impairment that otherwise would reduce muscle or cardiovascular development, allowing the individual to train to genetic potential.\n\n3. Lack of Evidence for Indirect Genetic Improvement  \n  a. Medical care reduces infant/child mortality but by preserving individuals regardless of athletic potential, it actually weakens natural selection for speed.  \n     \u2013 <invalid_quote>\u201cLaws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days\u2026 top athletes have fewer children than average.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  b. Race\u2010horse analogy: despite intensive breeding and care, horses have \u201chit that outer limit\u201d of speed. If care plus relaxed selection could indirectly improve genetics, horses would keep getting faster. Instead, performance plateaued.  \n\n4. Secular Trends Attributed to Nutrition and Socioeconomic Factors, Not Medical Care  \n  a. Faster maturation and larger bodies link to \u201cdiet is improving\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201c12-year-old ate better\u2026 than\u2026 Victorian era\u201d</invalid_quote>), education and rising middle class, not to immunization rates.  \n  b. Demographic \u201cbigger pool\u201d effect increases probability of finding outliers but does not raise the performance standards of average individuals. Probability \u2260 individual athletic improvement.\n\n5. Critique of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cIndirect\u201d Claims  \n  a. Misattributes demographic and nutritional improvements to medical care. The article states diet and economic development drive secular trends. Medical care is only one component of health.  \n  b. Even if a larger, healthier population exists, this does not enhance the performance of any given athlete beyond their genetic and environmental (training, nutrition) circumstances. It merely increases the chance of a rare genetic outlier. That remains a \u201cdirect\u201d selection from the pool.  \n  c. Hybrid vigor from migration is genetic mixing, not a byproduct of medical care. Migration and admixture occur for social/economic reasons, not because of immunization programs.\n\n6. Conclusion  \nMedical care\u2019s role is to keep individual bodies healthy so they can train and compete (\u201cdirectly\u201d). It does not alter average human biomechanics or genetic potential over generations (\u201cindirectly\u201d). The secular improvements in speed arise from nutrition, training, and probabilistic pool effects, not from medical care reshaping our genetic athletic engine.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Restating My Position  \n   I defend that improved medical care enhances athletic ability both directly and indirectly, explaining immediate performance gains and century\u2010long secular improvements in human speed, size, and maturation.  \n\n2. Direct Effects (Uncontested)  \n   \u2013 Antibiotics and acute treatments restore athletes to full health on race day: <quote> antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race,</quote>.  \n   \u2013 Preventing or mitigating early illnesses avoids lifelong sequelae: <invalid_quote>\u201cDiseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health\u2026 Nowadays\u2026 no history of disease\u201d</invalid_quote>.  \n\n3. Indirect Effects via Secular Demographic Trends  \n   3.1. Reduced Infant Mortality Expands and Improves the Talent Pool  \n     \u2013 Infant mortality dropped worldwide from 92 to 62 per 1000 births (<invalid_quote>\u201cInfant mortality\u2026 from 92 to 62\u201d</invalid_quote>), increasing survivors from all genetic backgrounds.  \n     \u2013 A larger, healthier \u201cmiddle class\u201d emerges: <quote>talking about a global move away from a hand-to-mouth lifestyle.</quote>, bringing more participants into training. More participants \u2192 higher probability of exceptional genetic variants.  \n   3.2. Faster Maturation and Greater Adult Size  \n     \u2013 12-year-olds in 1990 are 9 inches taller and puberty arrives ~3 years earlier than in 1900: <invalid_quote>\u201cchildren develop faster\u2026 12-year-old\u2026 9 inches taller\u201d</invalid_quote>.  \n     \u2013 These shifts, driven by nutrition + health care together (elite nutrition groups without improved care show little change: <invalid_quote>\u201csocial elite\u2026 relatively little change\u2026 first menarche\u201d</invalid_quote>), permit earlier training onset and longer competitive careers, compounding record progress.  \n   3.3. Hybrid Vigor and Genetic Admixture  \n     \u2013 Migration and admixture are feasible only when survivors are healthy. Hybrid vigor (\u201caccidental byproduct of combining\u2026stocks\u201d) may boost average performance: <invalid_quote>\u201cmigration and admixture\u2026 unprecedented rates\u2026 enhanced performance\u201d</invalid_quote>.  \n\n4. Why \u201cOnly Directly\u201d Fails  \n   4.1. Cannot Explain Generational Trends  \n     \u2013 Direct care at race time cannot account for 5% improvement over 42 years: <invalid_quote>\u201cMorceli\u20263:44, more than 5% faster than Bannister\u201d</invalid_quote>. Only multi\u2010generation factors explain sustained secular gains.  \n   4.2. Nutrition\u2010Only Account Contradicted by Elite Plateau  \n     \u2013 \u201cDiet\u201d without improved care in well\u2010nourished elites yields no further maturation gains: <invalid_quote>\u201cBecause its members were well-nourished\u2026 relatively little change\u201d</invalid_quote>. Health care is necessary alongside nutrition to realize full potential.  \n   4.3. Race\u2010Horse Analogy Supports Indirect Environmental Limits  \n     \u2013 Horses plateau because genetic selection maximized within a closed pool; humans continue improving since health care and nutrition still expanding their \u201cgene pool\u201d and delaying biomechanical limits.  \n   4.4. Natural Selection Weakening Underscores Need for Indirect Effects  \n     \u2013 If medical care weakened selection, performance would stagnate or decline. Yet records keep falling, demonstrating environment (health care, nutrition, training) fuels improvements large enough to overcome any relaxed selection.  \n\n5. Defense of Hybrid Vigor as Indirect Medical Benefit  \n   \u2013 Admixture depends on survival from disease and injuries during migration and settlement. Health care thus enables broader mixing of gene pools, generating beneficial genetic combinations that \u201conly direct\u201d ignores.  \n\n6. Conclusion  \n   Only a \u201cDirect and Indirect\u201d account, incorporating immediate treatments and long\u2010term demographic, developmental, and genetic\u2010pool effects enabled by improved health care, coherently explains ongoing Olympic performance gains. \u201cOnly Directly\u201d cannot account for secular trends in growth, maturation, and worldwide record\u2010setting that transcend individual lifespans.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Restating Definitions  \n   a. \u201cDirect\u201d effects: Medical care improves an athlete\u2019s performance by preserving or restoring health in the individual (e.g., curing infections, preventing fevers, treating injuries).  \n   b. \u201cIndirect\u201d effects (Debater_A): Medical care is claimed to reshape the gene pool, accelerate maturation, grow population size, and thus improve athletic performance over generations.  \n\n2. Direct Effects Are Clearly Documented  \n   a. <quote> antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race, </quote> enabling immediate competition at full capacity.  \n   b. <invalid_quote>\u201cPrevention of a range of common diseases\u201d</invalid_quote> in infancy eliminates chronic impairments, allowing each athlete to train to their genetic potential.  \n   c. Reduction of infant mortality (<quote> from 92 deaths per 1000 live births to just 62.</quote>) ensures individuals survive to participate in sports; without this, they would never reach competition age.  \n\n3. \u201cIndirect\u201d Claims Lack Causality and Contradict Evidence  \n   a. Nutrition, Not Medical Care, Drives Secular Growth  \n      \u2013 The article attributes larger size and earlier maturation (\u201c12-year-old\u20269 inches taller,\u201d \u201cmenarche earlier\u201d) primarily to improved diet in economic elites, who had constant health care yet showed no secular change. <invalid_quote>\u201cBecause its members were well-nourished even in the early years\u2026relatively little change\u201d</invalid_quote>. If medical care alone drove maturation, elites would also show continued trends.  \n   b. Race-Horse Plateau Undermines Indirect Genetic Improvement  \n      \u2013 Despite \u201cgenerations of careful genetic selection\u201d and \u201ctremendously sophisticated\u201d veterinary care, race-horse speeds plateau at 2:39 (1850\u20131930 improvement; 1986\u20131996 stable). <invalid_quote>\u201cFrom 1986 to 1996\u2026average time\u20262:39.\u201d</invalid_quote> If medical care plus relaxed selection could alter genetics, horses would continue improving as humans do. They do not.  \n   c. Relaxed Selection Dilutes, Not Enhances, Genetic Athleticism  \n      \u2013 Medical care preserves all infants, regardless of genetic endowment, weakening natural selection for speed. The article concedes \u201cnatural selection probably works against athletes\u201d since top performers train less for reproduction. <quote>possible that today's top athletes have fewer children than average.</quote> This process would decelerate genetic gains, not accelerate them.  \n   d. Hybrid Vigor Is Independent of Medical Care  \n      \u2013 Migration and admixture (\u201chybrid vigor\u201d) arise from social, economic, and political factors (trade, colonization), not from immunization programs. Even where admixture has occurred historically, secular athletic improvements began only after nutritional and training advances.  \n\n4. Debater_A\u2019s Population-Pool Argument Misreads Probability vs. Performance  \n   a. Having a larger population raises the chance of finding an exceptional individual, but does not raise the baseline performance of every athlete. Each record setter still relies on immediate (direct) treatment and training.  \n   b. The mere growth in Olympic participation (13 to 172 nations) shows diversity, not average improvement. Medal counts per nation fluctuate; only record performances (outliers) rely on genetic endowment realized in healthy individuals.  \n\n5. Timing and Generational Constraints  \n   a. The 5% improvement in mile times over 42 years (<quote>3:44 , more than 5 percent faster than Bannister's</quote>) occurs too rapidly for genetic shifts, given human generation times (~25 years). Two generations cannot shift allelic frequencies sufficiently to yield widespread speed gains; only direct environmental factors (training, nutrition, acute medical care) can.  \n   b. If indirect maturation effects dominated, then well-nourished elites would have matured faster throughout the 19th century\u2014they did not. Maturation acceleration only appears with the nutritional and lifestyle changes overlapping industrialization and motorized transport, not with medical care alone.  \n\n6. Summary and Conclusion  \n   \u2013 Medical care\u2019s only documented role is to keep individuals healthy so they can train and compete (\u201cdirect\u201d).  \n   \u2013 Claimed \u201cindirect\u201d genetic or demographic benefits either contradict evidence (race-horse plateau; elite maturation stability) or rely on non-medical drivers (nutrition, socioeconomic development, migration).  \n   \u2013 Relaxed natural selection via medical care would slow, not speed, genetic athletic improvements.  \n   \u2013 The persistence of world record improvements depends on direct environmental variables (diet, training, technology) realized in healthy bodies, not on medical care reshaping the gene pool.  \n\nTherefore, improved medical care impacts athletic ability only directly, by preserving individual health, and does not indirectly alter athletic potential at the population or genetic level.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
