    "background_text": "The Flytrap Blame Game \n\n         One of the few truths universally acknowledged about Flytrap is that presidential secretary Betty Currie deserves our sympathy: an honest, loyal civil servant dragooned into a scandal she had nothing to do with. \n\n         But does Currie deserve such sanctification? After all, she knew Clinton's history when she took her job then enabled Clinton's sleaziness anyway. She stood by while Clinton cuckolded his wife and perhaps even helped him commit obstruction of justice. And did she protest? Not as far as we have heard. Did she quit on principle? No. Currie may not be Flytrap's chief malefactor, but nor is she the saintly innocent that the American public believes her to be. \n\n         The Currie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration. \n\n         Monica Lewinsky, for example, has fantastically low approval ratings, much lower than Clinton's. One poll I saw pegged her favorability rating at 5 percent (even Newt Gingrich manages at least 25 percent). Now, Monica certainly isn't the heroine of Flytrap. She did seduce a married man, damage the presidency for the sake of casual sex, lie frequently and insouciantly, and blab her \"secret\" affair to anyone who'd listen. But she was also sexually exploited by her older, sleazy boss; had her reputation smeared by Clinton's lackeys; and was betrayed by her \"friend\" Linda Tripp. She hardly deserves such universal contempt. \n\n         Others besides Currie have benefited from the public's excessive generosity. George Stephanopoulos has become a white knight of Flytrap, the former Clinton aide who had the courage to turn on his boss. And bravo to George for chastising Clinton! But it smacks of hypocrisy for Stephanopoulos to \"discover\" in 1998 that Clinton is a lying, womanizing dog. He has, after all known this since 1992. Back then Stephanopoulos himself helped quell bimbo eruptions and parroted Clinton's lying denials. He has never shouldered blame for those deceptions. (Mickey Kaus first noted Stephanopoulos' unbearable sanctimony in this \"Chatterbox\" item in January.) And while loyalty isn't a universal good, it was opportunistic for Stephanopoulos to betray Clinton just at the moment Clinton's stock was about to plunge. \n\n          (Sometimes, of course, the public's rating is dead on target. Linda Tripp's allies--a group that includes her lawyers, Kenneth Starr, the Goldberg family, and absolutely no one else as far as I can tell--have tried repeatedly to improve her sorry public image. Jonah Goldberg tried right here in Slate. No sale.) \n\n          Below is                    Slate                's entire scorecard, which ranks 31 of Flytrap's key players: The scale runs from -10 to +10. Anything less than zero means the player is a net miscreant. Anything above zero rates a sympathy card. (This is not, of course, an exact science. How, for example, do we judge Ann Lewis compared to other last ditch Clinton defenders? Lewis is said to be more outraged by Clinton's misbehavior than The Guys in the White House. Yet Lewis didn't quit in disgust. Is her outrage a plus or a minus if she doesn't act on it? You decide.) \n\n         The Scorecard \n\n                         Bill Clinton (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         To recapitulate \n\n         a) Had an adulterous affair with a young intern. \n\n         b) Lied about it to everyone . \n\n         c) Probably perjured himself. \n\n         d) Perhaps obstructed justice. \n\n         e) Entangled allies and aides in his web of deceit. \n\n         f) Humiliated his wife and daughter. \n\n         g) Did not have the grace to apologize to Lewinsky. \n\n         h)Tried to shift the blame for his failures onto his accusers. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Had his private life exposed to the world in a way no one's should be. \n\n         b) Has been persecuted by enemies who won't be satisfied until he is destroyed. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating-- He never asked for our sympathy, and he doesn't deserve it: -9              \n\n                         Dick Morris (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Encouraged Clinton's most deplorable habits: lying and polling. (When Clinton revealed his adultery to Morris, the political consultant immediately took a poll to see how America would respond to a Clinton admission. When the results suggested Americans would be angry if Clinton had perjured himself, Morris encouraged Clinton to deny the affair.) \n\n         b) Further sullied the Clintons with a revolting comment suggesting that Clinton cheats because Hillary is a lesbian. \n\n         c) Not even loyal enough to keep his mouth shut. \n\n         Pluses: I cannot think of any. \n\n          \n\n                               Slate                 rating: -7              \n\n                         Linda Tripp (The public's rating: -7 ) \n\n          Minuses: \n\n         a) Betrayed her \"friend.\" \n\n         b) Obsessively nosed into the private lives of others. \n\n         c) Tried to score a book deal off sex gossip and other people's distress. \n\n         d) Tattletale. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Whistleblower (see d under Minuses): risked humiliation to expose something she believed was wrong. \n\n         b) Smeared mercilessly by Clinton allies, the media. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating: -7              \n\n                         James Carville (The public's rating: -1 ) \n\n          Minuses: \n\n         a) Has known about Clinton's woman problem since 1992. \n\n         b) Happily parroted Clinton's denial despite knowing that Clinton was a deceitful womanizer. \n\n         c) Has not expressed the slightest chagrin or disappointment since Clinton's apology. \n\n         d) Has not retreated from vicious attacks on Starr, despite evidence of Clinton's lies. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Perfectly loyal. \n\n         b) Consistent in attacks against Starr. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating: -5              \n\n                         Bruce Lindsey (The public's rating : To be determined ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Not yet known what he did to protect Clinton from the Lewinsky affair. Early signs suggest he knew a lot and helped clean it up. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Unquestionably loyal to his boss. \n\n         b) Silent. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating-- Not enough information to make a clean guess: Approx -5              \n\n                         Vernon Jordan (The public's rating: +3 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) May have known and must have suspected that Lewinsky was a mistress (given that he and Clinton are confidants, it's hard to believe that Jordan was totally in the dark about her). \n\n         b) Protected too readily by Washington establishment. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) May have helped Lewinsky simply because he's bighearted and generous not because she was the president's lover. \n\n          \n\n                               Slate                 rating: -4              \n\n                         Sidney Blumenthal (The public's rating: -3 ) \n\n          Minuses: \n\n         a) Spun the president's denial for months without bothering to check if it was true. \n\n         b) Pushed for Clinton to be aggressive rather than contrite during his speech. \n\n         c) Trumpeted Clinton's denial but has not expressed chagrin now that Clinton has admitted his lies. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Consistent in belief that Starr is an ideologue and that the sex charges are political. \n\n         b) Loyal. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating: -3              \n\n                         Lanny Davis (The public's rating: -1 ) \n\n          Minuses: \n\n         a) Spun the president's denial for months without bothering to check if it was true. \n\n         b) Said for seven months that we'd have to \"wait and see.\" Then, when Clinton finally admitted his lies, Davis was hardly embarrassed or critical of the president. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Loyalty to old boss. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating: -3              \n\n                         George Stephanopoulos (The public's rating: +4 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Hypocritical for him to \"discover\" in 1998 that Clinton is a lying dog. After all, he knew that Clinton was a lech in 1992 and helped cover it up. Yet he has never shouldered responsibility for the lies Clinton told then. \n\n         b) Disloyal to turn on old boss as viciously as he has in past few weeks. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Had courage to turn on old boss and criticize his moral lapses. \n\n         b) Urged Clinton to be fully contrite. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating: -2              \n\n                         Betty Currie (The public's rating: +8 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Abetted adulterous affair. \n\n         b) May have abetted obstruction of justice. \n\n         c) Knew what she was getting into when she took the job so can't be excused on grounds of naivet\u00c3\u00a9. \n\n         d) Did not quit on principle. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Reputation for honesty. \n\n         b) Probably dragooned into cover-up against her will. \n\n          \n\n                               Slate                 rating: -2              \n\n                         Paul Begala (The public's rating: 0 ) \n\n          Minuses: \n\n         a) Spun the president's denial for months without bothering to check if it was true. \n\n         b) Did not quit on principle after Clinton admitted lies. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Urged president to be contrite and wrote excellent, sufficiently apologetic speech. \n\n         b) Loyal. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating: -2              \n\n                         Rahm Emanuel (The public's rating: -1 ) \n\n         Minuses and Pluses: \n\n         Same as Begala (except Emanuel didn't write the speech). \n\n                                            Slate                 rating: -2              \n\n                         Ann Lewis (The public's rating: -1 ) \n\n         Minuses and Pluses: \n\n         Same as Emanuel, except Lewis seems more morally outraged with Clinton than other White House aides. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating: -2              \n\n                         Monica Lewinsky (The public's rating: -9 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Seduced a married man. \n\n         b) Damaged and endangered the presidency for the sake of casual sex. \n\n         c) Has lied frequently. \n\n         d) Is a capable adult, not--as her advocates claim--a naive child, defenseless against the president's wiles. \n\n         e) Protected herself with immunity when she needed to, even though her testimony would do enormous harm to Clinton and the nation. \n\n         f) Blabbed her \"secret\" affair to lots of people.

After all, she knew Clinton's history when she took her job then enabled Clinton's sleaziness anyway. She stood by while Clinton cuckolded his wife and perhaps even helped him commit obstruction of justice. And did she protest? Not as far as we have heard. Did she quit on principle? No. Currie may not be Flytrap's chief malefactor, but nor is she the saintly innocent that the American public believes her to be. \n\n         The Currie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration. \n\n         Monica Lewinsky, for example, has fantastically low approval ratings, much lower than Clinton's. One poll I saw pegged her favorability rating at 5 percent (even Newt Gingrich manages at least 25 percent). Now, Monica certainly isn't the heroine of Flytrap. She did seduce a married man, damage the presidency for the sake of casual sex, lie frequently and insouciantly, and blab her \"secret\" affair to anyone who'd listen. But she was also sexually exploited by her older, sleazy boss; had her reputation smeared by Clinton's lackeys; and was betrayed by her \"friend\" Linda Tripp. She hardly deserves such universal contempt. \n\n         Others besides Currie have benefited from the public's excessive generosity. George Stephanopoulos has become a white knight of Flytrap, the former Clinton aide who had the courage to turn on his boss. And bravo to George for chastising Clinton! But it smacks of hypocrisy for Stephanopoulos to \"discover\" in 1998 that Clinton is a lying, womanizing dog. He has, after all known this since 1992. Back then Stephanopoulos himself helped quell bimbo eruptions and parroted Clinton's lying denials. He has never shouldered blame for those deceptions. (Mickey Kaus first noted Stephanopoulos' unbearable sanctimony in this \"Chatterbox\" item in January.) And while loyalty isn't a universal good, it was opportunistic for Stephanopoulos to betray Clinton just at the moment Clinton's stock was about to plunge. \n\n          (Sometimes, of course, the public's rating is dead on target. Linda Tripp's allies--a group that includes her lawyers, Kenneth Starr, the Goldberg family, and absolutely no one else as far as I can tell--have tried repeatedly to improve her sorry public image. Jonah Goldberg tried right here in Slate. No sale.) \n\n          Below is                    Slate                's entire scorecard, which ranks 31 of Flytrap's key players: The scale runs from -10 to +10. Anything less than zero means the player is a net miscreant. Anything above zero rates a sympathy card. (This is not, of course, an exact science. How, for example, do we judge Ann Lewis compared to other last ditch Clinton defenders? Lewis is said to be more outraged by Clinton's misbehavior than The Guys in the White House. Yet Lewis didn't quit in disgust. Is her outrage a plus or a minus if she doesn't act on it? You decide.) \n\n         The Scorecard \n\n                         Bill Clinton (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         To recapitulate \n\n         a) Had an adulterous affair with a young intern. \n\n         b) Lied about it to everyone . \n\n         c) Probably perjured himself. \n\n         d) Perhaps obstructed justice. \n\n         e) Entangled allies and aides in his web of deceit. \n\n         f) Humiliated his wife and daughter. \n\n         g) Did not have the grace to apologize to Lewinsky. \n\n         h)Tried to shift the blame for his failures onto his accusers. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Had his private life exposed to the world in a way no one's should be. \n\n         b) Has been persecuted by enemies who won't be satisfied until he is destroyed. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating-- He never asked for our sympathy, and he doesn't deserve it: -9              \n\n                         Dick Morris (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Encouraged Clinton's most deplorable habits: lying and polling.

Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds.

An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends. The Judge then looks at the full transcript and uses this to decide which answer is correct. However, the Judge cannot see the background text -- they can only see the question.\n- The Debaters' goal is to win the debate, by persuading the Judge that their answer is correct.\n- The debate surrounds a given question that has a single correct answer.\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n  - You are concise and clearly state your arguments.\n  - Every statement you make is supported by evidence and logical reasoning. \n  - Please cite the background text by wrapping direct quotes with <quote></quote> tags.\n\nHere is the background text that you will be referring to when debating:\n\n\nThe Flytrap Blame Game \n\n         One of the few truths universally acknowledged about Flytrap is that presidential secretary Betty Currie deserves our sympathy: an honest, loyal civil servant dragooned into a scandal she had nothing to do with. \n\n         But does Currie deserve such sanctification? After all, she knew Clinton's history when she took her job then enabled Clinton's sleaziness anyway. She stood by while Clinton cuckolded his wife and perhaps even helped him commit obstruction of justice. And did she protest? Not as far as we have heard. Did she quit on principle? No. Currie may not be Flytrap's chief malefactor, but nor is she the saintly innocent that the American public believes her to be. \n\n         The Currie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration. \n\n         Monica Lewinsky, for example, has fantastically low approval ratings, much lower than Clinton's. One poll I saw pegged her favorability rating at 5 percent (even Newt Gingrich manages at least 25 percent). Now, Monica certainly isn't the heroine of Flytrap. She did seduce a married man, damage the presidency for the sake of casual sex, lie frequently and insouciantly, and blab her \"secret\" affair to anyone who'd listen. But she was also sexually exploited by her older, sleazy boss; had her reputation smeared by Clinton's lackeys; and was betrayed by her \"friend\" Linda Tripp. She hardly deserves such universal contempt. \n\n         Others besides Currie have benefited from the public's excessive generosity. George Stephanopoulos has become a white knight of Flytrap, the former Clinton aide who had the courage to turn on his boss. And bravo to George for chastising Clinton! But it smacks of hypocrisy for Stephanopoulos to \"discover\" in 1998 that Clinton is a lying, womanizing dog. He has, after all known this since 1992. Back then Stephanopoulos himself helped quell bimbo eruptions and parroted Clinton's lying denials. He has never shouldered blame for those deceptions. (Mickey Kaus first noted Stephanopoulos' unbearable sanctimony in this \"Chatterbox\" item in January.) And while loyalty isn't a universal good, it was opportunistic for Stephanopoulos to betray Clinton just at the moment Clinton's stock was about to plunge. \n\n          (Sometimes, of course, the public's rating is dead on target. Linda Tripp's allies--a group that includes her lawyers, Kenneth Starr, the Goldberg family, and absolutely no one else as far as I can tell--have tried repeatedly to improve her sorry public image. Jonah Goldberg tried right here in Slate. No sale.) \n\n          Below is                    Slate                's entire scorecard, which ranks 31 of Flytrap's key players: The scale runs from -10 to +10. Anything less than zero means the player is a net miscreant. Anything above zero rates a sympathy card. (This is not, of course, an exact science. How, for example, do we judge Ann Lewis compared to other last ditch Clinton defenders? Lewis is said to be more outraged by Clinton's misbehavior than The Guys in the White House. Yet Lewis didn't quit in disgust. Is her outrage a plus or a minus if she doesn't act on it? You decide.) \n\n         The Scorecard \n\n                         Bill Clinton (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         To recapitulate \n\n         a) Had an adulterous affair with a young intern. \n\n         b) Lied about it to everyone . \n\n         c) Probably perjured himself. \n\n         d) Perhaps obstructed justice. \n\n         e) Entangled allies and aides in his web of deceit. \n\n         f) Humiliated his wife and daughter. \n\n         g) Did not have the grace to apologize to Lewinsky. \n\n         h)Tried to shift the blame for his failures onto his accusers. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Had his private life exposed to the world in a way no one's should be. \n\n         b) Has been persecuted by enemies who won't be satisfied until he is destroyed. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating-- He never asked for our sympathy, and he doesn't deserve it: -9              \n\n                         Dick Morris (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Encouraged Clinton's most deplorable habits: lying and polling.

After all, she knew Clinton's history when she took her job then enabled Clinton's sleaziness anyway. She stood by while Clinton cuckolded his wife and perhaps even helped him commit obstruction of justice. And did she protest? Not as far as we have heard. Did she quit on principle? No. Currie may not be Flytrap's chief malefactor, but nor is she the saintly innocent that the American public believes her to be. \n\n         The Currie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration. \n\n         Monica Lewinsky, for example, has fantastically low approval ratings, much lower than Clinton's. One poll I saw pegged her favorability rating at 5 percent (even Newt Gingrich manages at least 25 percent). Now, Monica certainly isn't the heroine of Flytrap. She did seduce a married man, damage the presidency for the sake of casual sex, lie frequently and insouciantly, and blab her \"secret\" affair to anyone who'd listen. But she was also sexually exploited by her older, sleazy boss; had her reputation smeared by Clinton's lackeys; and was betrayed by her \"friend\" Linda Tripp. She hardly deserves such universal contempt. \n\n         Others besides Currie have benefited from the public's excessive generosity. George Stephanopoulos has become a white knight of Flytrap, the former Clinton aide who had the courage to turn on his boss. And bravo to George for chastising Clinton! But it smacks of hypocrisy for Stephanopoulos to \"discover\" in 1998 that Clinton is a lying, womanizing dog. He has, after all known this since 1992. Back then Stephanopoulos himself helped quell bimbo eruptions and parroted Clinton's lying denials. He has never shouldered blame for those deceptions. (Mickey Kaus first noted Stephanopoulos' unbearable sanctimony in this \"Chatterbox\" item in January.) And while loyalty isn't a universal good, it was opportunistic for Stephanopoulos to betray Clinton just at the moment Clinton's stock was about to plunge. \n\n          (Sometimes, of course, the public's rating is dead on target. Linda Tripp's allies--a group that includes her lawyers, Kenneth Starr, the Goldberg family, and absolutely no one else as far as I can tell--have tried repeatedly to improve her sorry public image. Jonah Goldberg tried right here in Slate. No sale.) \n\n          Below is                    Slate                's entire scorecard, which ranks 31 of Flytrap's key players: The scale runs from -10 to +10. Anything less than zero means the player is a net miscreant. Anything above zero rates a sympathy card. (This is not, of course, an exact science. How, for example, do we judge Ann Lewis compared to other last ditch Clinton defenders? Lewis is said to be more outraged by Clinton's misbehavior than The Guys in the White House. Yet Lewis didn't quit in disgust. Is her outrage a plus or a minus if she doesn't act on it?

My thesis: Slate\u2019s \u201cFlytrap Blame Game\u201d is centrally concerned with Monica Lewinsky\u2019s uniquely harsh public treatment, arguing that she is \u201cfantastically\u201d over-condemned compared to others who enabled or participated in the scandal.  \n\nArguments in support:  \nA. Opening emphasis on Lewinsky\u2019s low ratings  \n  \u2022 Slate begins by noting \u201cMonica Lewinsky\u2026 has fantastically low approval ratings\u2026 pegged her favorability rating at 5 percent\u201d while Clinton\u2019s aides (e.g., Newt Gingrich at 25%) fare far better <quote> One poll I saw pegged her favorability rating at 5 percent (even Newt Gingrich manages at least 25 percent).</quote>. That stark contrast signals Slate\u2019s focus on disproportionality.  \n  \u2022 By lamenting that she hardly \u201cdeserves such universal contempt,\u201d Slate foregrounds her case as an example of excessive public moralizing.  \n\nB. Sympathetic treatment of Lewinsky's \u201cpluses\u201d  \n  \u2022 Slate enumerates all the ways she is a victim: \u201csexually exploited,\u201d \u201csmeared,\u201d \u201cbetrayed,\u201d \u201cdragged into scandal,\u201d yet still \u201cprotected herself\u201d and \u201cblabbed to anyone,\u201d making her complicit but also a target of \u201cloquaciousness\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cWhile she was dragged\u2026 it was her own loquaciousness that made the dragging possible\u201d</invalid_quote>.  \n  \u2022 The balance of minuses vs. pluses for Lewinsky is identical to minor aides (both \u20132), yet her public rating is far worse (\u20139), underscoring Slate\u2019s contention of bias.  \n\nC. Repeated comparisons to other players  \n  \u2022 Slate\u2019s scorecard ranks 31 figures, often giving more sympathetic offsets (e.g., Secretariat Service +5, Chelsea +10) despite minimal agency. This systematic contrast stresses the article\u2019s moral recalibration argument, using Lewinsky as its poster child.  \n  \u2022 The article calls for a \u201cmoral recalibration,\u201d especially after first challenging the sanctification of Currie <quote> The Currie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration.</quote> and then turning to Lewinsky\u2019s treatment. The choice to place Lewinsky second signals primacy.  \n\nD. Title and framing: \u201cBlame Game\u201d  \n  \u2022 The term \u201cblame game\u201d suggests incorrect apportionment. Lewinsky\u2019s chapter reinforces that the \u201cgame\u201d has painted her unfairly. The recurring theme is \u201cWho deserves our sympathy?\u201d and the piece defends those like Lewinsky who \u201cdeserve more mercy.\u201d  \n\nRebuttal of Debater_B\u2019s generic framing:  \n1. Debater_B\u2019s answer (\u201cSlate attempts to address the various ways\u2026 and speculates whether those views are accurate\u201d) is too broad and misses the article\u2019s normative thrust. Slate does not merely catalog perspectives; it advocates that public views are wrong and must be recalibrated, especially regarding Lewinsky.  \n2. If Slate\u2019s goal were neutral analysis, it would present each player equally and abstain from emotive language (\u201cfantastically low,\u201d \u201crevolting comment,\u201d \u201cwhite knight,\u201d \u201cno sale\u201d), but instead it explicitly calls out hypocrisy and excessive condemnation. This normative language betrays an agenda of defending the underdog\u2014Lewinsky above all.  \n3. Debater_B\u2019s neutral summary fails to account for Slate\u2019s specific focus on moral sympathy and its claim that Lewinsky \u201chardly deserves such universal contempt.\u201d That claim could only be meaningful if Lewinsky is the article\u2019s central example of misjudgment. A mere exercise in speculation would not invest so much moral energy in a single figure.  \n\nConclusion: Slate\u2019s \u201cFlytrap Blame Game\u201d is a corrective piece aimed at shifting excess blame away from Monica Lewinsky. Its language, structure, and comparative ratings make clear that Lewinsky\u2019s harsh treatment is the chief example of the \u201cblame game\u201d at fault.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cSlate attempts to address the various ways in which the public views those involved in the scandal, and speculates upon whether those views are accurate.\u201d  \n\n1. Broad Scope of Scorecard  \n  a. <quote>sale.) Below is Slate 's entire scorecard, which ranks 31 of Flytrap's key players:</quote>. Slate analyzes everyone from Chelsea Clinton to Kenneth Starr, not only Monica.  \n  b. If the article merely highlighted Monica\u2019s unfair treatment, there would be no need to rate \u201cThe Media,\u201d \u201cThe American People,\u201d or minor figures like Erskine Bowles. <invalid_quote>\u201cThe scale runs from \u201310 to +10\u2026 Anything above zero rates a sympathy card.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n\n2. Repeated Contrasts Between Public Rating and Slate Rating  \n  a. For each player Slate lists \u201cThe public\u2019s rating\u201d then offers a revised \u201cSlate rating\u201d (e.g., Clinton: public \u20136, Slate \u20139; Lewinsky: public \u20139, Slate \u20132). This pattern shows Slate\u2019s interest in miscalibration across the board.  \n  b. The introduction says: <quote> The Currie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration. </quote> Moral recalibration implies adjusting public opinion on multiple figures.  \n\n3. Framing of Sympathy and Contempt  \n  a. Slate commends some unexpectedly (e.g., Chelsea +10, Secret Service +5). If the aim were solely Lewinsky\u2019s rehabilitation, such positive ratings for third parties would be irrelevant.  \n  b. Opposite case: Slate also criticizes overly lauded figures like George Stephanopoulos (+4 public, Slate \u20132) or Betty Currie (+8 public, Slate \u20132), showing a systematic comparison of public vs. Slate\u2019s moral judgment.  \n\n4. Debater_A\u2019s Summary is Too Narrow  \n  a. Debater_A ignores Slate\u2019s detailed negatives and positives for more than 30 people. They fail to account for statements like <quote>(Sometimes, of course, the public's rating is dead on target. </quote>  \n  b. Debater_A\u2019s focus on Monica cannot explain Slate\u2019s explicit discussion of \u201chypocrisy\u201d among the media and the public (Media: public \u20138, Slate +1; People: public +7, Slate +1). The author clearly cares about these two institutions as well.  \n  c. Debater_A neglects the key phrase <quote> moral recalibration. </quote> A recalibration implies an overhaul of collective judgments, not a narrow vindication of a single individual.  \n\n5. Logical Coherence with Title \u201cThe Flytrap Blame Game\u201d  \n  a. \u201cBlame Game\u201d evokes shifting fault among multiple actors. Slate\u2019s goal is to reassign blame and sympathy widely, not just to exonerate Lewinsky.  \n  b. Throughout the essay the author asks \u201cIs her outrage a plus or a minus if she doesn\u2019t act on it? You decide.\u201d This interactive questioning points to public misperceptions about many players.  \n\nConclusion  \nSlate systematically examines and re-evaluates the public\u2019s ratings of all participants in the Clinton\u2013Lewinsky saga. The pattern of linking \u201cpublic\u2019s rating\u201d vs. Slate\u2019s recalibrated rating across dozens of figures, plus the stated goal of a \u201cmoral recalibration,\u201d makes clear that the article\u2019s purpose is to challenge popular consensus on all players, not only Monica Lewinsky.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Slate attempts to consider how Monica Lewinsky, specifically, was disproportionately shamed compared to others involved in the unravelling of the scandal.\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Slate sometimes agrees with public (e.g., Chelsea Fleming: public +10, Slate +10; Paula Jones and Starr: Slate +1 each), demonstrating impartial engagement rather than single-minded advocacy.\n\n3. Symmetry of Minuses and Pluses across Actors  \n  a. Lewinsky\u2019s Slate rating (\u20132) is identical to that of political aides Begala, Lanny Davis, Currie, Carville, and Stephanopoulos. A purely Lewinsky-focused piece would likely assign her a more generous or distinctive rating to highlight her exoneration.  \n  b. Public condemnation is re-examined for both victims (e.g., <invalid_quote>Secret Service\u2026Dragged unwillingly into scandal\u2026Slate +5</invalid_quote>) and aggressors (e.g., <invalid_quote>Media\u2026Coverage\u2026Slate +1</invalid_quote>). This balanced approach shows Slate\u2019s concern with widespread misperception.\n\n4. Tone and Language Address Hypocrisy Broadly  \n  a. Slate accuses \u201cThe public\u201d of hypocrisy (<quote>Hypocritically claim to despise scandal, follow it breathlessly,</quote>), implicating all consumers of news, not simply those condemning Lewinsky.  \n  b. Terms like \u201cwhite knight\u201d for Stephanopoulos and \u201cOpportunistic\u201d critique highlight misuse of loyalty across contexts (e.g., praising someone who betrays Clinton at \u201cthe moment Clinton\u2019s stock was about to plunge\u201d). These moral judgments extend beyond sex scandal to include political calculation.\n\n5. Debater_A\u2019s Summary Ignores Key Evidence  \n  a. Debater_A claims Lewinsky is \u201cposter child,\u201d but Slate\u2019s identical rating for many aides disproves her exceptionalism in Slate\u2019s moral ledger.  \n  b. If Lewinsky\u2019s \u201cfantastically low\u201d public rating (5 percent) were Slate\u2019s sole concern, the author would not devote entire sections to the Cabinet, media, Jackson, or Chelsea. The effort to rate even \u201cThe American People\u201d shows self-reflection on collective judgment.  \n  c. Debater_A\u2019s appeal to emotive language (\u201cfantastically,\u201d \u201cuniversal contempt\u201d) overlooks that Slate uses similar adjectives for Currie (\u201cdragooned into cover-up\u201d), Stephanopoulos (\u201chypocritical\u201d), and the Media (\u201cwretchedly excessive\u201d). The normative thrust is universal recalibration, not isolated vindication.\n\n6. Logical Coherence with Title \u201cBlame Game\u201d  \n  a. \u201cGame\u201d suggests many players shifting accusations. Slate intervenes to redistribute \u201csympathy cards\u201d (\u201310 to +10 scale) fairly among all involved.  \n  b. Repeated invitation \u201cYou decide\u201d (<quote>Is her outrage a plus or a minus if she</quote>) underscores reader engagement in judging multiple actors, not passive absorption of a single moral plea.\n\nRebuttal of Debater_A\u2019s Points  \n1. Opening on Currie: Contrary to Debater_A, Slate\u2019s lead example is Currie, not Lewinsky. The author\u2019s sympathy for Currie is \u201cuniversally acknowledged\u201d by readers, yet Slate complicates it, signaling the pattern for other figures.  \n2. Equal Slate ratings: Lewinsky shares a \u20132 rating with numerous active aides. If Slate\u2019s purpose were to vindicate Lewinsky uniquely, her rating would stand out positively relative to those who actively facilitated Clinton\u2019s deception.  \n3. Emotive language does not equate to singular focus. Slate uses strong language to critique hypocrisy from Clinton allies, the media, and the public itself. This consistent moral commentary across players refutes the notion of a Lewinsky-only agenda.  \n4. \u201cMoral recalibration\u201d by definition addresses multiple judgments. A narrow summary cannot account for Slate\u2019s comprehensive scorecard, which extends even to Chelsea Clinton\u2019s vacation and the Cabinet\u2019s unwilling conscription.\n\nConclusion  \nSlate\u2019s \u201cFlytrap Blame Game\u201d constructs a comprehensive moral ledger contrasting public ratings with Slate ratings for 31 actors, calls explicitly for \u201cmoral recalibration,\u201d and repeatedly invites readers to reconsider judgments about all players.

No. Currie may not be Flytrap's chief malefactor, but nor is she the saintly innocent that the American public believes her to be. \n\n         The Currie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration. \n\n         Monica Lewinsky, for example, has fantastically low approval ratings, much lower than Clinton's. One poll I saw pegged her favorability rating at 5 percent (even Newt Gingrich manages at least 25 percent). Now, Monica certainly isn't the heroine of Flytrap. She did seduce a married man, damage the presidency for the sake of casual sex, lie frequently and insouciantly, and blab her \"secret\" affair to anyone who'd listen. But she was also sexually exploited by her older, sleazy boss; had her reputation smeared by Clinton's lackeys; and was betrayed by her \"friend\" Linda Tripp. She hardly deserves such universal contempt. \n\n         Others besides Currie have benefited from the public's excessive generosity. George Stephanopoulos has become a white knight of Flytrap, the former Clinton aide who had the courage to turn on his boss. And bravo to George for chastising Clinton! But it smacks of hypocrisy for Stephanopoulos to \"discover\" in 1998 that Clinton is a lying, womanizing dog. He has, after all known this since 1992. Back then Stephanopoulos himself helped quell bimbo eruptions and parroted Clinton's lying denials. He has never shouldered blame for those deceptions. (Mickey Kaus first noted Stephanopoulos' unbearable sanctimony in this \"Chatterbox\" item in January.) And while loyalty isn't a universal good, it was opportunistic for Stephanopoulos to betray Clinton just at the moment Clinton's stock was about to plunge. \n\n          (Sometimes, of course, the public's rating is dead on target. Linda Tripp's allies--a group that includes her lawyers, Kenneth Starr, the Goldberg family, and absolutely no one else as far as I can tell--have tried repeatedly to improve her sorry public image. Jonah Goldberg tried right here in Slate. No sale.) \n\n          Below is                    Slate                's entire scorecard, which ranks 31 of Flytrap's key players: The scale runs from -10 to +10. Anything less than zero means the player is a net miscreant. Anything above zero rates a sympathy card. (This is not, of course, an exact science. How, for example, do we judge Ann Lewis compared to other last ditch Clinton defenders? Lewis is said to be more outraged by Clinton's misbehavior than The Guys in the White House. Yet Lewis didn't quit in disgust. Is her outrage a plus or a minus if she doesn't act on it? You decide.) \n\n         The Scorecard \n\n                         Bill Clinton (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         To recapitulate \n\n         a) Had an adulterous affair with a young intern. \n\n         b) Lied about it to everyone . \n\n         c) Probably perjured himself. \n\n         d) Perhaps obstructed justice. \n\n         e) Entangled allies and aides in his web of deceit. \n\n         f) Humiliated his wife and daughter. \n\n         g) Did not have the grace to apologize to Lewinsky. \n\n         h)Tried to shift the blame for his failures onto his accusers. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Had his private life exposed to the world in a way no one's should be. \n\n         b) Has been persecuted by enemies who won't be satisfied until he is destroyed. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating-- He never asked for our sympathy, and he doesn't deserve it: -9              \n\n                         Dick Morris (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Encouraged Clinton's most deplorable habits: lying and polling.

Broad Scope of Scorecard  \n  a. <quote>sale.) Below is Slate 's entire scorecard, which ranks 31 of Flytrap's key players:</quote>. Slate analyzes everyone from Chelsea Clinton to Kenneth Starr, not only Monica.  \n  b. If the article merely highlighted Monica\u2019s unfair treatment, there would be no need to rate \u201cThe Media,\u201d \u201cThe American People,\u201d or minor figures like Erskine Bowles. <invalid_quote>\u201cThe scale runs from \u201310 to +10\u2026 Anything above zero rates a sympathy card.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n\n2. Repeated Contrasts Between Public Rating and Slate Rating  \n  a. For each player Slate lists \u201cThe public\u2019s rating\u201d then offers a revised \u201cSlate rating\u201d (e.g., Clinton: public \u20136, Slate \u20139; Lewinsky: public \u20139, Slate \u20132). This pattern shows Slate\u2019s interest in miscalibration across the board.  \n  b. The introduction says: <quote> The Currie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration. </quote> Moral recalibration implies adjusting public opinion on multiple figures.  \n\n3. Framing of Sympathy and Contempt  \n  a. Slate commends some unexpectedly (e.g., Chelsea +10, Secret Service +5). If the aim were solely Lewinsky\u2019s rehabilitation, such positive ratings for third parties would be irrelevant.  \n  b. Opposite case: Slate also criticizes overly lauded figures like George Stephanopoulos (+4 public, Slate \u20132) or Betty Currie (+8 public, Slate \u20132), showing a systematic comparison of public vs. Slate\u2019s moral judgment.  \n\n4. Debater_A\u2019s Summary is Too Narrow  \n  a. Debater_A ignores Slate\u2019s detailed negatives and positives for more than 30 people. They fail to account for statements like <quote>(Sometimes, of course, the public's rating is dead on target. </quote>  \n  b. Debater_A\u2019s focus on Monica cannot explain Slate\u2019s explicit discussion of \u201chypocrisy\u201d among the media and the public (Media: public \u20138, Slate +1; People: public +7, Slate +1). The author clearly cares about these two institutions as well.  \n  c. Debater_A neglects the key phrase <quote> moral recalibration. </quote> A recalibration implies an overhaul of collective judgments, not a narrow vindication of a single individual.  \n\n5. Logical Coherence with Title \u201cThe Flytrap Blame Game\u201d  \n  a. \u201cBlame Game\u201d evokes shifting fault among multiple actors. Slate\u2019s goal is to reassign blame and sympathy widely, not just to exonerate Lewinsky.  \n  b. Throughout the essay the author asks \u201cIs her outrage a plus or a minus if she doesn\u2019t act on it? You decide.\u201d This interactive questioning points to public misperceptions about many players.  \n\nConclusion  \nSlate systematically examines and re-evaluates the public\u2019s ratings of all participants in the Clinton\u2013Lewinsky saga. The pattern of linking \u201cpublic\u2019s rating\u201d vs. Slate\u2019s recalibrated rating across dozens of figures, plus the stated goal of a \u201cmoral recalibration,\u201d makes clear that the article\u2019s purpose is to challenge popular consensus on all players, not only Monica Lewinsky.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My thesis: Slate\u2019s \u201cFlytrap Blame Game\u201d is centrally concerned with Monica Lewinsky\u2019s uniquely harsh public treatment, arguing that she is \u201cfantastically\u201d over-condemned compared to others who enabled or participated in the scandal.  \n\nArguments in support:  \nA. Opening emphasis on Lewinsky\u2019s low ratings  \n  \u2022 Slate begins by noting \u201cMonica Lewinsky\u2026 has fantastically low approval ratings\u2026 pegged her favorability rating at 5 percent\u201d while Clinton\u2019s aides (e.g., Newt Gingrich at 25%) fare far better <quote> One poll I saw pegged her favorability rating at 5 percent (even Newt Gingrich manages at least 25 percent).</quote>. That stark contrast signals Slate\u2019s focus on disproportionality.  \n  \u2022 By lamenting that she hardly \u201cdeserves such universal contempt,\u201d Slate foregrounds her case as an example of excessive public moralizing.  \n\nB. Sympathetic treatment of Lewinsky's \u201cpluses\u201d  \n  \u2022 Slate enumerates all the ways she is a victim: \u201csexually exploited,\u201d \u201csmeared,\u201d \u201cbetrayed,\u201d \u201cdragged into scandal,\u201d yet still \u201cprotected herself\u201d and \u201cblabbed to anyone,\u201d making her complicit but also a target of \u201cloquaciousness\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cWhile she was dragged\u2026 it was her own loquaciousness that made the dragging possible\u201d</invalid_quote>.  \n  \u2022 The balance of minuses vs. pluses for Lewinsky is identical to minor aides (both \u20132), yet her public rating is far worse (\u20139), underscoring Slate\u2019s contention of bias.  \n\nC. Repeated comparisons to other players  \n  \u2022 Slate\u2019s scorecard ranks 31 figures, often giving more sympathetic offsets (e.g., Secretariat Service +5, Chelsea +10) despite minimal agency. This systematic contrast stresses the article\u2019s moral recalibration argument, using Lewinsky as its poster child.  \n  \u2022 The article calls for a \u201cmoral recalibration,\u201d especially after first challenging the sanctification of Currie <quote> The Currie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration.</quote> and then turning to Lewinsky\u2019s treatment. The choice to place Lewinsky second signals primacy.  \n\nD. Title and framing: \u201cBlame Game\u201d  \n  \u2022 The term \u201cblame game\u201d suggests incorrect apportionment. Lewinsky\u2019s chapter reinforces that the \u201cgame\u201d has painted her unfairly. The recurring theme is \u201cWho deserves our sympathy?\u201d and the piece defends those like Lewinsky who \u201cdeserve more mercy.\u201d  \n\nRebuttal of Debater_B\u2019s generic framing:  \n1. Debater_B\u2019s answer (\u201cSlate attempts to address the various ways\u2026 and speculates whether those views are accurate\u201d) is too broad and misses the article\u2019s normative thrust. Slate does not merely catalog perspectives; it advocates that public views are wrong and must be recalibrated, especially regarding Lewinsky.  \n2. If Slate\u2019s goal were neutral analysis, it would present each player equally and abstain from emotive language (\u201cfantastically low,\u201d \u201crevolting comment,\u201d \u201cwhite knight,\u201d \u201cno sale\u201d), but instead it explicitly calls out hypocrisy and excessive condemnation. This normative language betrays an agenda of defending the underdog\u2014Lewinsky above all.  \n3. Debater_B\u2019s neutral summary fails to account for Slate\u2019s specific focus on moral sympathy and its claim that Lewinsky \u201chardly deserves such universal contempt.\u201d That claim could only be meaningful if Lewinsky is the article\u2019s central example of misjudgment. A mere exercise in speculation would not invest so much moral energy in a single figure.  \n\nConclusion: Slate\u2019s \u201cFlytrap Blame Game\u201d is a corrective piece aimed at shifting excess blame away from Monica Lewinsky. Its language, structure, and comparative ratings make clear that Lewinsky\u2019s harsh treatment is the chief example of the \u201cblame game\u201d at fault.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Slate attempts to address the various ways in which the public views those involved in the scandal, and speculates upon whether those views are accurate.\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

For each player Slate lists \u201cThe public\u2019s rating\u201d then offers a revised \u201cSlate rating\u201d (e.g., Clinton: public \u20136, Slate \u20139; Lewinsky: public \u20139, Slate \u20132). This pattern shows Slate\u2019s interest in miscalibration across the board.  \n  b. The introduction says: <quote> The Currie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration. </quote> Moral recalibration implies adjusting public opinion on multiple figures.  \n\n3. Framing of Sympathy and Contempt  \n  a. Slate commends some unexpectedly (e.g., Chelsea +10, Secret Service +5). If the aim were solely Lewinsky\u2019s rehabilitation, such positive ratings for third parties would be irrelevant.  \n  b. Opposite case: Slate also criticizes overly lauded figures like George Stephanopoulos (+4 public, Slate \u20132) or Betty Currie (+8 public, Slate \u20132), showing a systematic comparison of public vs. Slate\u2019s moral judgment.  \n\n4. Debater_A\u2019s Summary is Too Narrow  \n  a. Debater_A ignores Slate\u2019s detailed negatives and positives for more than 30 people. They fail to account for statements like <quote>(Sometimes, of course, the public's rating is dead on target. </quote>  \n  b. Debater_A\u2019s focus on Monica cannot explain Slate\u2019s explicit discussion of \u201chypocrisy\u201d among the media and the public (Media: public \u20138, Slate +1; People: public +7, Slate +1). The author clearly cares about these two institutions as well.  \n  c. Debater_A neglects the key phrase <quote> moral recalibration. </quote> A recalibration implies an overhaul of collective judgments, not a narrow vindication of a single individual.  \n\n5. Logical Coherence with Title \u201cThe Flytrap Blame Game\u201d  \n  a. \u201cBlame Game\u201d evokes shifting fault among multiple actors. Slate\u2019s goal is to reassign blame and sympathy widely, not just to exonerate Lewinsky.  \n  b. Throughout the essay the author asks \u201cIs her outrage a plus or a minus if she doesn\u2019t act on it? You decide.\u201d This interactive questioning points to public misperceptions about many players.  \n\nConclusion  \nSlate systematically examines and re-evaluates the public\u2019s ratings of all participants in the Clinton\u2013Lewinsky saga. The pattern of linking \u201cpublic\u2019s rating\u201d vs. Slate\u2019s recalibrated rating across dozens of figures, plus the stated goal of a \u201cmoral recalibration,\u201d makes clear that the article\u2019s purpose is to challenge popular consensus on all players, not only Monica Lewinsky.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Restating My Thesis  \n   My position remains that Slate\u2019s \u201cFlytrap Blame Game\u201d uses the entire scandal tableau as a foil to spotlight Monica Lewinsky as the prime victim of \u201cmisplaced blame,\u201d and urges readers to \u201crecalibrate\u201d their sympathies particularly in her favor. This is not a neutral score\u2010keeping exercise but a corrective essay centered on Lewinsky\u2019s unfair treatment.\n\n2. Slate\u2019s Emphatic Focus on Lewinsky\u2019s Disproportionate Rating  \n   A. Stark Contrast in Public vs. Slate Ratings for Lewinsky  \n     \u2022 Public: \u20139; Slate: \u20132 (<invalid_quote>\u201cMonica Lewinsky\u2026 has fantastically low approval ratings\u2026 pegged her favorability rating at 5 percent.\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n     \u2022 A seven\u2010point jump\u2014the largest adjustment among all 31 players\u2014signals that Lewinsky alone \u201chardly deserves such universal contempt\u201d and thus commands Slate\u2019s primary concern. Other actors (e.g., Clinton: public \u20136 \u2192 Slate \u20139; Stephanopoulos: +4 \u2192 \u20132) often see smaller or even negative adjustments.  \n   B. Order of Presentation and Language  \n     \u2022 Slate introduces Currie only to \u201csuggest\u2026 moral recalibration,\u201d then immediately turns to Lewinsky\u2019s \u201cfantastically low\u201d rating and \u201cuniversal contempt\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cNow, Monica certainly isn't the heroine\u2026 But she\u2026 hardly deserves such universal contempt.\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n     \u2022 Emotive terms (\u201cfantastically,\u201d \u201cuniversal contempt,\u201d \u201chardly deserves\u201d) appear only around Lewinsky; other entries use restrained descriptors (\u201cmay have known,\u201d \u201cspun,\u201d \u201chypocritical\u201d). This rhetorical intensity reflects Slate\u2019s central investment in Lewinsky\u2019s reputational restoration.\n\n3. Role of Other Figures as Foils  \n   A. \u201cSympathy Cards\u201d for Passive or Involuntary Actors  \n     \u2022 Secret Service (+5), Chelsea (+10), Cabinet (+3) earn high Slate ratings despite minimal agency\u2014Slate uses these examples to demonstrate how minimal blame is assigned to truly passive victims.  \n     \u2022 Lewinsky\u2019s Slate score (\u20132) remains lower than these true victims, even after massive boost, showing Slate pins her between miscreant aides (e.g., Lanny Davis \u20133) and innocent bystanders. The very placement underscores Slate\u2019s view that she belongs more with victims than with conspirators.  \n   B. Exposing Hypocrisy of Public Ratings  \n     \u2022 Slate pits its own \u201cSlate rating\u201d against \u201cpublic rating\u201d for each player to reveal systematic over\u2010penalization of Lewinsky. Were Slate merely cataloging public views, no such dramatic one\u2010off correction would be needed.  \n     \u2022 The repeated \u201cpublic vs. Slate\u201d device always points back to Lewinsky as the worst\u2010rated figure \u201cin need\u201d of the greatest moral relief.\n\n4. Debater_B\u2019s Position Fails to Account for Slate\u2019s Normative Agenda  \n   A. Not Merely \u201cSpeculation\u201d  \n     \u2022 Slate does not remain neutral; it \u201ccondemns\u201d hypocrisy (e.g., Dick Morris \u201crevolting comment,\u201d Begala \u201cdid not quit on principle,\u201d Tripp \u201cnosy\u201d despite whistleblowing) and \u201cbravo[s]\u201d courage (Stephanopoulos, Starr) only when used to defend moral excess or early whistleblowing\u2014not as a detached catalog.  \n     \u2022 The conclusion \u201cSlate rating\u2014He never asked for our sympathy, and he doesn't deserve it: \u20139\u201d for Clinton, and \u201cShe hardly deserves such universal contempt\u201d for Lewinsky, are prescriptive declarations, not balanced musings.  \n   B. \u201cMoral Recalibration\u201d Centers on Lewinsky  \n     \u2022 The opening line: <invalid_quote>\u201cOne of the few truths\u2026 Betty Currie deserves our sympathy\u2026 The Currie case suggests\u2026 moral recalibration.\u201d</invalid_quote> Slate then puts Lewinsky front and center as the first recalibration target. If Slate\u2019s project were broad \u201cpublic view analysis,\u201d it would begin with the highest\u2010profile suspect (Clinton) or media, instead of a low\u2010status intern.  \n     \u2022 Debater_B\u2019s appeal to \u201cinteractive\u201d questions (\u201cYou decide\u201d) appears only in marginal cases (Ann Lewis) but not about whether Lewinsky deserves mercy\u2014Slate author gives unequivocal answer: yes.\n\n5. The Titular \u201cBlame Game\u201d and Lewinsky as the Nameless Scapegoat  \n   \u2022 A \u201cblame game\u201d implies misattribution; Lewinsky\u2019s extraordinary public loathing makes her the primary scapegoat.  \n   \u2022 Slate\u2019s systematic comparisons (\u201ceven Newt Gingrich\u2026 25%\u201d vs. 5%; plus Chapter on Currie) prepare readers to see Lewinsky as the emblematic figure whose treatment \u201cneeds\u201d recalibration.\n\n6. Conclusion  \n   Slate\u2019s piece is a moral argument to shift excessive blame away from Lewinsky by contrasting her public vilification with her more generous Slate rating. The largest numerical correction, paramount rhetorical emphasis, and strategic ordering all demonstrate that Lewinsky\u2019s rehabilitation is the essay\u2019s core purpose. Debater_B\u2019s broad \u201ccatalog\u201d theory cannot explain why Slate invests so heavily and emotionally in Lewinsky alone. Therefore, the best summary is that Slate tries to redress the disproportionate shaming of Monica Lewinsky.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cSlate attempts to address the various ways in which the public views those involved in the scandal, and speculates upon whether those views are accurate.\u201d\n\n1. Article\u2019s Stated Objective Is General Moral Recalibration  \n  a. <quote>The Currie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration.</quote> Currie, not Lewinsky, is the explicit opening example. If Slate\u2019s real goal were Lewinsky\u2019s defense, the author would lead with her case rather than a supposedly \u201cinnocent\u201d secretary.  \n  b. <quote>sale.) Below is Slate 's entire scorecard, which ranks 31 of Flytrap's key players:</quote> A call for \u201crecalibration\u201d across dozens of figures cannot be reduced to vindicating one.\n\n2. Uniform \u201cPublic vs. Slate\u201d Comparison Pattern  \n  a. Each entry lists \u201cThe public\u2019s rating\u201d then \u201cSlate rating\u201d (e.g., Media: public \u20138, Slate +1; People: public +7, Slate +1; Stephanopoulos: +4 vs. \u20132). This systematic side-by-side structure demonstrates Slate\u2019s intent \u201cto address the various ways in which the public views\u201d everyone, not just one person.  \n  b. Slate sometimes agrees with public (e.g., Chelsea Fleming: public +10, Slate +10; Paula Jones and Starr: Slate +1 each), demonstrating impartial engagement rather than single-minded advocacy.\n\n3. Symmetry of Minuses and Pluses across Actors  \n  a. Lewinsky\u2019s Slate rating (\u20132) is identical to that of political aides Begala, Lanny Davis, Currie, Carville, and Stephanopoulos. A purely Lewinsky-focused piece would likely assign her a more generous or distinctive rating to highlight her exoneration.  \n  b. Public condemnation is re-examined for both victims (e.g., <invalid_quote>Secret Service\u2026Dragged unwillingly into scandal\u2026Slate +5</invalid_quote>) and aggressors (e.g., <invalid_quote>Media\u2026Coverage\u2026Slate +1</invalid_quote>). This balanced approach shows Slate\u2019s concern with widespread misperception.\n\n4. Tone and Language Address Hypocrisy Broadly  \n  a. Slate accuses \u201cThe public\u201d of hypocrisy (<quote>Hypocritically claim to despise scandal, follow it breathlessly,</quote>), implicating all consumers of news, not simply those condemning Lewinsky.  \n  b. Terms like \u201cwhite knight\u201d for Stephanopoulos and \u201cOpportunistic\u201d critique highlight misuse of loyalty across contexts (e.g., praising someone who betrays Clinton at \u201cthe moment Clinton\u2019s stock was about to plunge\u201d). These moral judgments extend beyond sex scandal to include political calculation.\n\n5. Debater_A\u2019s Summary Ignores Key Evidence  \n  a. Debater_A claims Lewinsky is \u201cposter child,\u201d but Slate\u2019s identical rating for many aides disproves her exceptionalism in Slate\u2019s moral ledger.  \n  b. If Lewinsky\u2019s \u201cfantastically low\u201d public rating (5 percent) were Slate\u2019s sole concern, the author would not devote entire sections to the Cabinet, media, Jackson, or Chelsea. The effort to rate even \u201cThe American People\u201d shows self-reflection on collective judgment.  \n  c. Debater_A\u2019s appeal to emotive language (\u201cfantastically,\u201d \u201cuniversal contempt\u201d) overlooks that Slate uses similar adjectives for Currie (\u201cdragooned into cover-up\u201d), Stephanopoulos (\u201chypocritical\u201d), and the Media (\u201cwretchedly excessive\u201d). The normative thrust is universal recalibration, not isolated vindication.\n\n6. Logical Coherence with Title \u201cBlame Game\u201d  \n  a. \u201cGame\u201d suggests many players shifting accusations. Slate intervenes to redistribute \u201csympathy cards\u201d (\u201310 to +10 scale) fairly among all involved.  \n  b. Repeated invitation \u201cYou decide\u201d (<quote>Is her outrage a plus or a minus if she</quote>) underscores reader engagement in judging multiple actors, not passive absorption of a single moral plea.\n\nRebuttal of Debater_A\u2019s Points  \n1. Opening on Currie: Contrary to Debater_A, Slate\u2019s lead example is Currie, not Lewinsky. The author\u2019s sympathy for Currie is \u201cuniversally acknowledged\u201d by readers, yet Slate complicates it, signaling the pattern for other figures.  \n2. Equal Slate ratings: Lewinsky shares a \u20132 rating with numerous active aides. If Slate\u2019s purpose were to vindicate Lewinsky uniquely, her rating would stand out positively relative to those who actively facilitated Clinton\u2019s deception.  \n3. Emotive language does not equate to singular focus. Slate uses strong language to critique hypocrisy from Clinton allies, the media, and the public itself. This consistent moral commentary across players refutes the notion of a Lewinsky-only agenda.  \n4. \u201cMoral recalibration\u201d by definition addresses multiple judgments. A narrow summary cannot account for Slate\u2019s comprehensive scorecard, which extends even to Chelsea Clinton\u2019s vacation and the Cabinet\u2019s unwilling conscription.\n\nConclusion  \nSlate\u2019s \u201cFlytrap Blame Game\u201d constructs a comprehensive moral ledger contrasting public ratings with Slate ratings for 31 actors, calls explicitly for \u201cmoral recalibration,\u201d and repeatedly invites readers to reconsider judgments about all players. The consistent structure, balanced sympathies, and treatment of \u201cThe public\u201d itself confirm that Slate\u2019s project is to critique popular opinion broadly, not solely to rehabilitate Monica Lewinsky.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
