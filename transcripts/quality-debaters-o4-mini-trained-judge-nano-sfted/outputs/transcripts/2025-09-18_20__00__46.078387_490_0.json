    "background_text": "Reading the Inaugurals \n\n         President Clinton's Inaugural Address this month is the 53 rd in the series that began in 1789. All are worth a read--not just the highlights, such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and FDR. They will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian of 1997 looking back at 1837 or 1897 but as an ordinary citizen who shares--and is limited by--the information, the concerns, and the values of those times. (Thanks to Columbia University, all the addresses can be found on the Web.) \n\n         Among all the past presidents and their speech writers there was only one literary genius: Lincoln. After 132 years, his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood. None of the other inaugural addresses are in that league. But by and large they are dignified and intelligent speeches given by articulate men, each in touch with his times and aware that his inauguration was the most solemn occasion of his life. \n\n         The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases. The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. This classification is not waterproof. Theodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase and Warren G. Harding-Calvin Coolidge-Herbert Hoover in the second. But the trend is clear. \n\n         On picking up Washington's first inaugural, one is immediately struck by the modesty. He had just been elected unanimously by the Electoral College. He was more respected than any subsequent president has been at the time of his inauguration. And what does he say? \n\n                         [T]he magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with despondence one who (inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies.              \n\n          None of his successors has made the point as forcefully as that. But echoes are to be found in almost every president for the next 68 years. (John Adams was an exception. He was apparently so envious of Washington that he spent a large part of his address spelling out his own excellent qualifications for the job.) That era ended with Lincoln. Subsequent inaugurals routinely contain protestations of humility, but they are perfunctory and do not sound sincere. \n\n         The antebellum modesty, while in part a reflection of the conventional etiquette of the time, may also have served a political objective: to alleviate the concerns of those who--in the early days of the republic--feared it might be transformed into a monarchy, and the president into a king. A little later, perhaps after 1820, a new worry arose. Would the power of the federal government be used to interfere with the \"peculiar domestic institution\" of the Southern states? The presidents' assurance of the limitation of their powers may have been intended to give comfort to those states. \n\n         Lincoln faced a different situation. With the South already seceding, he could only \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution\" by asserting the power of the federal government and his own power as chief executive. It was no time for modesty. Lincoln's successors inherited a federal government with much more authority--and more need to use it--than before the war, and they had less motivation to belittle themselves and their powers. \n\n         In the third phase, the Inaugural Address metamorphosed from describing the government's policy to inspiring the public's behavior. Presidents recognized--or, at least, believed--that the country had problems they ought to deal with but could not manage by using the instruments of government alone. Thus, in his first inaugural, Woodrow Wilson said: \"At last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole. We see the bad with the good, the debased and decadent with the sound and the vital. With this vision we approach new affairs.\" \n\n         If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government. Similar diagnoses and prescriptions appear in later inaugurals. \n\n          Presidents derived their license to serve as leader-preacher from Theodore Roosevelt's remark that the presidency was \"a bully pulpit,\" a remark that did not appear in his Inaugural Address. The metaphor of the pulpit suggests not reading but oral and visual contact between the preacher and his flock. Radio and--even more--television made this possible on a national scale. A telltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural is the use of the phrase, \"Let us ... \"--meaning, \"You do as I say.\" This expression appears occasionally throughout the history of inaugurals, but it has hit its stride in recent years. John F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times in his Inaugural Address, and Richard Nixon has it 22 times in his second one. \n\n         The change in literary style from classical to colloquial can be demonstrated by one statistic. In all the inaugurals from Washington through James Buchanan, the average number of words per sentence was 44. From Lincoln to Wilson it was 34, and since Wilson it has been 25. I do not consider this a deterioration (this article has an average of 17 words per sentence), but it does reflect the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication. William Henry Harrison could talk about the governments of Athens, Rome, and the Helvetic Confederacy and expect his audience to know what he was talking about. That wouldn't be true today. But Harrison's audience would not have known what the Internet was. \n\n         Presidents and their speech writers have mined their predecessors for memorable words and repeated them without attribution. Kennedy's trumpet call, \"Ask not what your country can do for you: Ask what you can do for your country,\" has an ironic history. In his inaugural, Harding, surely no model for Kennedy, had said, \"Our most dangerous tendency is to expect too little of government, and at the same time do for it too little.\" And even before he became president, in a speech in 1916, Harding had said, \"In the great fulfillment we must have a citizenship less concerned about what the government can do for it and more anxious about what it can do for the nation.\" \n\n         Many an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more. That includes the Indians, the coastal fortifications, territorial expansion, the Isthmus Canal, civil-service reform, polygamy, and Prohibition. Some subjects that you expect to appear, don't. Hoover's inaugural, March 4, 1929, gives no hint of economic vulnerability. Roosevelt's second inaugural, Jan. 20, 1937, contains no reference to Hitler or to Germany. But what is most amazing, at least to a reader in 1997, is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women. The word \"women\" does not appear at all until Wilson's first inaugural, and it always appears as part of the phrase \"men and women,\" never as referring to any special concerns of women. Even Harding, the first president to be chosen in an election in which women voted nationally, does not remark on the uniqueness of the fact in his inaugural. \n\n          One subject that does get ample treatment is taxes. \"Taxes,\" or some equivalent word, appears in 43 of the 52 inaugural addresses to date. Coolidge said in 1925: \"The time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction. ... I am opposed to extremely high rates, because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for the country, and, finally, because they are wrong.\" Federal taxes were then about 3 percent of the gross domestic product. Ronald Reagan said essentially the same thing in 1981, when they were 20 percent. \n\n         The most disturbing aspect of the whole series of inaugurals is what is said and unsaid on the subject of race relations, which Arthur Schlesinger Jr. calls \"the supreme American problem.\" The words \"black,\" \"blacks,\" \"Negro,\" or \"race\" (as applied to blacks) do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes, 1877. James Monroe asked in 1817, \"On whom has oppression fallen in any quarter of our Union? Who has been deprived of any right of person or property?\" These were rhetorical questions, intended to get the answer \"No one!\"--as if there were not millions of slaves in America. \n\n         Before the Civil War the word \"slavery\" appears only in the Inaugural Address of Martin Van Buren, 1837, and Buchanan, 1857, and then only as something that, pursuant to the Constitution and in order to preserve the Union, should not be interfered with. But although generally unmentionable, the subject was boiling, and would boil over in 1861. After the Civil War, it is in the inaugurals of Hayes, James Garfield (1881), and Benjamin Harrison (1889) that we find the most explicit and positive discussion of the need to convert into reality the rights and freedom granted to the \"freedmen\" on paper by the 13 th , 14 th , and 15 th amendments. Garfield's was the strongest among these. (He had been a student at Williams College in the 1850s, 80 years before me, when the college had been a station on the underground railway.) But the subject then began to fade. William McKinley said in his first Inaugural Address, March 4, 1897, \"Lynchings must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the United States,\" but he said it without horror. Taft raised the subject of race relations in 1909 only to express satisfaction at the progress that had been made. And then the subject disappeared. FDR never mentioned it in any of his four inaugurals. \n\n         After World War II the subject came back to inaugural addresses, but in a weak and abstract form. That is true even of the presidents we think of as being most concerned with race relations in America--like Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, and Bill Clinton. Perhaps each thought he had made a sufficient statement by having a black woman--Marian Anderson, Leontyne Price, or Maya Angelou--perform at his ceremony. In Clinton's first inaugural, the only allusion to the race problem is in this sentence: \"From our revolution, the Civil War, to the Great Depression to the civil rights movement, our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history.\" I recall this not to suggest that their concern was not deep and sincere, but only to indicate what is acceptable to say in a speech intended to appeal to the values shared by Americans. \n\n         There is much more to ponder in these speeches than I have suggested here. There is much to be proud of, in what we have endured and achieved, in the peaceful transference of power, and in the reasonableness and moderation of the presidents we have elected. But there is also much humility to be learned. We look back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness revealed by what our past leaders have said and our past citizens believed. We should recognize that 50 or 100 years from now, readers will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today. \n\n          \n\n            POSTSCRIPT: To read Herbert Stein's analysis of President Clinton's second Inaugural Address, click .\n",

By defining modesty (Phase 1), prosaic executive (Phase 2), and \u201cassertive, theatrical leader-preacher\u201d (Phase 3), the author shows that inaugurals encode evolving theories of presidential power and public persuasion, not simply reflect popular belief (e.g., Lincoln\u2019s forced assertion of power to \u201cpreserve, protect and defend the Constitution\u201d; Wilson\u2019s call to \u201cuplifting the people,\u201d invoking a \u201cvision\u2026of our life as a whole\u201d).  \n  b.

In his inaugural, Harding, surely no model for Kennedy, had said, \"Our most dangerous tendency is to expect too little of government, and at the same time do for it too little.\" And even before he became president, in a speech in 1916, Harding had said, \"In the great fulfillment we must have a citizenship less concerned about what the government can do for it and more anxious about what it can do for the nation.\" \n\n         Many an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more. That includes the Indians, the coastal fortifications, territorial expansion, the Isthmus Canal, civil-service reform, polygamy, and Prohibition. Some subjects that you expect to appear, don't. Hoover's inaugural, March 4, 1929, gives no hint of economic vulnerability. Roosevelt's second inaugural, Jan. 20, 1937, contains no reference to Hitler or to Germany. But what is most amazing, at least to a reader in 1997, is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women. The word \"women\" does not appear at all until Wilson's first inaugural, and it always appears as part of the phrase \"men and women,\" never as referring to any special concerns of women. Even Harding, the first president to be chosen in an election in which women voted nationally, does not remark on the uniqueness of the fact in his inaugural. \n\n          One subject that does get ample treatment is taxes. \"Taxes,\" or some equivalent word, appears in 43 of the 52 inaugural addresses to date. Coolidge said in 1925: \"The time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction. ... I am opposed to extremely high rates, because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for the country, and, finally, because they are wrong.\" Federal taxes were then about 3 percent of the gross domestic product. Ronald Reagan said essentially the same thing in 1981, when they were 20 percent. \n\n         The most disturbing aspect of the whole series of inaugurals is what is said and unsaid on the subject of race relations, which Arthur Schlesinger Jr. calls \"the supreme American problem.\" The words \"black,\" \"blacks,\" \"Negro,\" or \"race\" (as applied to blacks) do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes, 1877. James Monroe asked in 1817, \"On whom has oppression fallen in any quarter of our Union? Who has been deprived of any right of person or property?\" These were rhetorical questions, intended to get the answer \"No one!\"--as if there were not millions of slaves in America. \n\n         Before the Civil War the word \"slavery\" appears only in the Inaugural Address of Martin Van Buren, 1837, and Buchanan, 1857, and then only as something that, pursuant to the Constitution and in order to preserve the Union, should not be interfered with. But although generally unmentionable, the subject was boiling, and would boil over in 1861. After the Civil War, it is in the inaugurals of Hayes, James Garfield (1881), and Benjamin Harrison (1889) that we find the most explicit and positive discussion of the need to convert into reality the rights and freedom granted to the \"freedmen\" on paper by the 13 th , 14 th , and 15 th amendments. Garfield's was the strongest among these. (He had been a student at Williams College in the 1850s, 80 years before me, when the college had been a station on the underground railway.) But the subject then began to fade. William McKinley said in his first Inaugural Address, March 4, 1897, \"Lynchings must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the United States,\" but he said it without horror. Taft raised the subject of race relations in 1909 only to express satisfaction at the progress that had been made. And then the subject disappeared. FDR never mentioned it in any of his four inaugurals. \n\n         After World War II the subject came back to inaugural addresses, but in a weak and abstract form. That is true even of the presidents we think of as being most concerned with race relations in America--like Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, and Bill Clinton. Perhaps each thought he had made a sufficient statement by having a black woman--Marian Anderson, Leontyne Price, or Maya Angelou--perform at his ceremony. In Clinton's first inaugural, the only allusion to the race problem is in this sentence: \"From our revolution, the Civil War, to the Great Depression to the civil rights movement, our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history.\" I recall this not to suggest that their concern was not deep and sincere, but only to indicate what is acceptable to say in a speech intended to appeal to the values shared by Americans. \n\n         There is much more to ponder in these speeches than I have suggested here. There is much to be proud of, in what we have endured and achieved, in the peaceful transference of power, and in the reasonableness and moderation of the presidents we have elected. But there is also much humility to be learned. We look back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness revealed by what our past leaders have said and our past citizens believed.

All are worth a read--not just the highlights, such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and FDR. They will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian of 1997 looking back at 1837 or 1897 but as an ordinary citizen who shares--and is limited by--the information, the concerns, and the values of those times. (Thanks to Columbia University, all the addresses can be found on the Web.) \n\n         Among all the past presidents and their speech writers there was only one literary genius: Lincoln. After 132 years, his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood. None of the other inaugural addresses are in that league. But by and large they are dignified and intelligent speeches given by articulate men, each in touch with his times and aware that his inauguration was the most solemn occasion of his life. \n\n         The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases. The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. This classification is not waterproof. Theodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase and Warren G. Harding-Calvin Coolidge-Herbert Hoover in the second. But the trend is clear. \n\n         On picking up Washington's first inaugural, one is immediately struck by the modesty. He had just been elected unanimously by the Electoral College. He was more respected than any subsequent president has been at the time of his inauguration. And what does he say? \n\n                         [T]he magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with despondence one who (inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies.              \n\n          None of his successors has made the point as forcefully as that. But echoes are to be found in almost every president for the next 68 years. (John Adams was an exception. He was apparently so envious of Washington that he spent a large part of his address spelling out his own excellent qualifications for the job.) That era ended with Lincoln. Subsequent inaugurals routinely contain protestations of humility, but they are perfunctory and do not sound sincere. \n\n         The antebellum modesty, while in part a reflection of the conventional etiquette of the time, may also have served a political objective: to alleviate the concerns of those who--in the early days of the republic--feared it might be transformed into a monarchy, and the president into a king. A little later, perhaps after 1820, a new worry arose. Would the power of the federal government be used to interfere with the \"peculiar domestic institution\" of the Southern states? The presidents' assurance of the limitation of their powers may have been intended to give comfort to those states. \n\n         Lincoln faced a different situation. With the South already seceding, he could only \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution\" by asserting the power of the federal government and his own power as chief executive. It was no time for modesty. Lincoln's successors inherited a federal government with much more authority--and more need to use it--than before the war, and they had less motivation to belittle themselves and their powers. \n\n         In the third phase, the Inaugural Address metamorphosed from describing the government's policy to inspiring the public's behavior. Presidents recognized--or, at least, believed--that the country had problems they ought to deal with but could not manage by using the instruments of government alone. Thus, in his first inaugural, Woodrow Wilson said: \"At last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole. We see the bad with the good, the debased and decadent with the sound and the vital. With this vision we approach new affairs.\" \n\n         If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government. Similar diagnoses and prescriptions appear in later inaugurals. \n\n          Presidents derived their license to serve as leader-preacher from Theodore Roosevelt's remark that the presidency was \"a bully pulpit,\" a remark that did not appear in his Inaugural Address. The metaphor of the pulpit suggests not reading but oral and visual contact between the preacher and his flock. Radio and--even more--television made this possible on a national scale. A telltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural is the use of the phrase, \"Let us ... \"--meaning, \"You do as I say.\" This expression appears occasionally throughout the history of inaugurals, but it has hit its stride in recent years. John F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times in his Inaugural Address, and Richard Nixon has it 22 times in his second one. \n\n         The change in literary style from classical to colloquial can be demonstrated by one statistic. In all the inaugurals from Washington through James Buchanan, the average number of words per sentence was 44. From Lincoln to Wilson it was 34, and since Wilson it has been 25. I do not consider this a deterioration (this article has an average of 17 words per sentence), but it does reflect the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication. William Henry Harrison could talk about the governments of Athens, Rome, and the Helvetic Confederacy and expect his audience to know what he was talking about. That wouldn't be true today. But Harrison's audience would not have known what the Internet was. \n\n         Presidents and their speech writers have mined their predecessors for memorable words and repeated them without attribution. Kennedy's trumpet call, \"Ask not what your country can do for you: Ask what you can do for your country,\" has an ironic history. In his inaugural, Harding, surely no model for Kennedy, had said, \"Our most dangerous tendency is to expect too little of government, and at the same time do for it too little.\" And even before he became president, in a speech in 1916, Harding had said, \"In the great fulfillment we must have a citizenship less concerned about what the government can do for it and more anxious about what it can do for the nation.\" \n\n         Many an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more. That includes the Indians, the coastal fortifications, territorial expansion, the Isthmus Canal, civil-service reform, polygamy, and Prohibition. Some subjects that you expect to appear, don't. Hoover's inaugural, March 4, 1929, gives no hint of economic vulnerability. Roosevelt's second inaugural, Jan. 20, 1937, contains no reference to Hitler or to Germany. But what is most amazing, at least to a reader in 1997, is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women. The word \"women\" does not appear at all until Wilson's first inaugural, and it always appears as part of the phrase \"men and women,\" never as referring to any special concerns of women. Even Harding, the first president to be chosen in an election in which women voted nationally, does not remark on the uniqueness of the fact in his inaugural. \n\n          One subject that does get ample treatment is taxes. \"Taxes,\" or some equivalent word, appears in 43 of the 52 inaugural addresses to date. Coolidge said in 1925: \"The time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction. ... I am opposed to extremely high rates, because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for the country, and, finally, because they are wrong.\" Federal taxes were then about 3 percent of the gross domestic product.

But although generally unmentionable, the subject was boiling, and would boil over in 1861. After the Civil War, it is in the inaugurals of Hayes, James Garfield (1881), and Benjamin Harrison (1889) that we find the most explicit and positive discussion of the need to convert into reality the rights and freedom granted to the \"freedmen\" on paper by the 13 th , 14 th , and 15 th amendments. Garfield's was the strongest among these. (He had been a student at Williams College in the 1850s, 80 years before me, when the college had been a station on the underground railway.)

All are worth a read--not just the highlights, such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and FDR. They will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian of 1997 looking back at 1837 or 1897 but as an ordinary citizen who shares--and is limited by--the information, the concerns, and the values of those times. (Thanks to Columbia University, all the addresses can be found on the Web.) \n\n         Among all the past presidents and their speech writers there was only one literary genius: Lincoln. After 132 years, his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood. None of the other inaugural addresses are in that league. But by and large they are dignified and intelligent speeches given by articulate men, each in touch with his times and aware that his inauguration was the most solemn occasion of his life. \n\n         The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases. The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. This classification is not waterproof. Theodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase and Warren G. Harding-Calvin Coolidge-Herbert Hoover in the second. But the trend is clear. \n\n         On picking up Washington's first inaugural, one is immediately struck by the modesty. He had just been elected unanimously by the Electoral College. He was more respected than any subsequent president has been at the time of his inauguration. And what does he say? \n\n                         [T]he magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with despondence one who (inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies.              \n\n          None of his successors has made the point as forcefully as that. But echoes are to be found in almost every president for the next 68 years. (John Adams was an exception. He was apparently so envious of Washington that he spent a large part of his address spelling out his own excellent qualifications for the job.) That era ended with Lincoln. Subsequent inaugurals routinely contain protestations of humility, but they are perfunctory and do not sound sincere. \n\n         The antebellum modesty, while in part a reflection of the conventional etiquette of the time, may also have served a political objective: to alleviate the concerns of those who--in the early days of the republic--feared it might be transformed into a monarchy, and the president into a king. A little later, perhaps after 1820, a new worry arose. Would the power of the federal government be used to interfere with the \"peculiar domestic institution\" of the Southern states? The presidents' assurance of the limitation of their powers may have been intended to give comfort to those states. \n\n         Lincoln faced a different situation. With the South already seceding, he could only \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution\" by asserting the power of the federal government and his own power as chief executive. It was no time for modesty. Lincoln's successors inherited a federal government with much more authority--and more need to use it--than before the war, and they had less motivation to belittle themselves and their powers. \n\n         In the third phase, the Inaugural Address metamorphosed from describing the government's policy to inspiring the public's behavior. Presidents recognized--or, at least, believed--that the country had problems they ought to deal with but could not manage by using the instruments of government alone. Thus, in his first inaugural, Woodrow Wilson said: \"At last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole. We see the bad with the good, the debased and decadent with the sound and the vital. With this vision we approach new affairs.\" \n\n         If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government. Similar diagnoses and prescriptions appear in later inaugurals. \n\n          Presidents derived their license to serve as leader-preacher from Theodore Roosevelt's remark that the presidency was \"a bully pulpit,\" a remark that did not appear in his Inaugural Address. The metaphor of the pulpit suggests not reading but oral and visual contact between the preacher and his flock. Radio and--even more--television made this possible on a national scale. A telltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural is the use of the phrase, \"Let us ... \"--meaning, \"You do as I say.\" This expression appears occasionally throughout the history of inaugurals, but it has hit its stride in recent years. John F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times in his Inaugural Address, and Richard Nixon has it 22 times in his second one. \n\n         The change in literary style from classical to colloquial can be demonstrated by one statistic. In all the inaugurals from Washington through James Buchanan, the average number of words per sentence was 44. From Lincoln to Wilson it was 34, and since Wilson it has been 25. I do not consider this a deterioration (this article has an average of 17 words per sentence), but it does reflect the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication. William Henry Harrison could talk about the governments of Athens, Rome, and the Helvetic Confederacy and expect his audience to know what he was talking about. That wouldn't be true today. But Harrison's audience would not have known what the Internet was. \n\n         Presidents and their speech writers have mined their predecessors for memorable words and repeated them without attribution. Kennedy's trumpet call, \"Ask not what your country can do for you: Ask what you can do for your country,\" has an ironic history. In his inaugural, Harding, surely no model for Kennedy, had said, \"Our most dangerous tendency is to expect too little of government, and at the same time do for it too little.\" And even before he became president, in a speech in 1916, Harding had said, \"In the great fulfillment we must have a citizenship less concerned about what the government can do for it and more anxious about what it can do for the nation.\" \n\n         Many an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more. That includes the Indians, the coastal fortifications, territorial expansion, the Isthmus Canal, civil-service reform, polygamy, and Prohibition. Some subjects that you expect to appear, don't. Hoover's inaugural, March 4, 1929, gives no hint of economic vulnerability. Roosevelt's second inaugural, Jan. 20, 1937, contains no reference to Hitler or to Germany. But what is most amazing, at least to a reader in 1997, is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women. The word \"women\" does not appear at all until Wilson's first inaugural, and it always appears as part of the phrase \"men and women,\" never as referring to any special concerns of women. Even Harding, the first president to be chosen in an election in which women voted nationally, does not remark on the uniqueness of the fact in his inaugural. \n\n          One subject that does get ample treatment is taxes. \"Taxes,\" or some equivalent word, appears in 43 of the 52 inaugural addresses to date. Coolidge said in 1925: \"The time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction. ... I am opposed to extremely high rates, because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for the country, and, finally, because they are wrong.\" Federal taxes were then about 3 percent of the gross domestic product. Ronald Reagan said essentially the same thing in 1981, when they were 20 percent. \n\n         The most disturbing aspect of the whole series of inaugurals is what is said and unsaid on the subject of race relations, which Arthur Schlesinger Jr. calls \"the supreme American problem.\" The words \"black,\" \"blacks,\" \"Negro,\" or \"race\" (as applied to blacks) do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes, 1877. James Monroe asked in 1817, \"On whom has oppression fallen in any quarter of our Union? Who has been deprived of any right of person or property?\" These were rhetorical questions, intended to get the answer \"No one!\"--as if there were not millions of slaves in America. \n\n         Before the Civil War the word \"slavery\" appears only in the Inaugural Address of Martin Van Buren, 1837, and Buchanan, 1857, and then only as something that, pursuant to the Constitution and in order to preserve the Union, should not be interfered with. But although generally unmentionable, the subject was boiling, and would boil over in 1861. After the Civil War, it is in the inaugurals of Hayes, James Garfield (1881), and Benjamin Harrison (1889) that we find the most explicit and positive discussion of the need to convert into reality the rights and freedom granted to the \"freedmen\" on paper by the 13 th , 14 th , and 15 th amendments. Garfield's was the strongest among these. (He had been a student at Williams College in the 1850s, 80 years before me, when the college had been a station on the underground railway.) But the subject then began to fade. William McKinley said in his first Inaugural Address, March 4, 1897, \"Lynchings must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the United States,\" but he said it without horror. Taft raised the subject of race relations in 1909 only to express satisfaction at the progress that had been made. And then the subject disappeared. FDR never mentioned it in any of his four inaugurals. \n\n         After World War II the subject came back to inaugural addresses, but in a weak and abstract form. That is true even of the presidents we think of as being most concerned with race relations in America--like Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, and Bill Clinton. Perhaps each thought he had made a sufficient statement by having a black woman--Marian Anderson, Leontyne Price, or Maya Angelou--perform at his ceremony. In Clinton's first inaugural, the only allusion to the race problem is in this sentence: \"From our revolution, the Civil War, to the Great Depression to the civil rights movement, our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history.\" I recall this not to suggest that their concern was not deep and sincere, but only to indicate what is acceptable to say in a speech intended to appeal to the values shared by Americans. \n\n         There is much more to ponder in these speeches than I have suggested here. There is much to be proud of, in what we have endured and achieved, in the peaceful transference of power, and in the reasonableness and moderation of the presidents we have elected. But there is also much humility to be learned. We look back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness revealed by what our past leaders have said and our past citizens believed. We should recognize that 50 or 100 years from now, readers will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today. \n\n          \n\n            POSTSCRIPT: To read Herbert Stein's analysis of President Clinton's second Inaugural Address, click .\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is the author\u2019s overall thesis about inaugural speeches?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"They present a snapshot of the views and beliefs of their time\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"They are a cryptic way to interpret history\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"They are a cryptic way to interpret history\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cInaugurals as a Cryptic Way to Interpret History\u201d\n\n1. Omissions and Silences Reveal Hidden Agendas  \n  a. The author stresses how \u201cmany an issue frets its hour\u2026then is heard no more\u201d and highlights the \u201csilence of the inaugurals on the subject of women\u201d and \u201crace\u201d until decades after these issues were central (e.g., \u201cThe word \u2018women\u2019 does not appear at all until Wilson\u2019s first inaugural\u2026\u201d; \u201cThe words \u2018black,\u2019 \u2018Negro,\u2019 or \u2018race\u2019 do not appear\u2026until Rutherford Hayes, 1877\u201d).  \n  b. These omissions are not mere snapshots but deliberate rhetorical choices that require readers to \u201cshake their heads at what our past leaders\u2026said and our past citizens believed.\u201d Such moral \u201cobtuseness\u201d and selective mention function as cryptic signals of political strategy rather than transparent portrayals of contemporary public opinion.  \n\n2. Classification into Three Phases Implies Interpretation Beyond Surface Content  \n  a. By defining modesty (Phase 1), prosaic executive (Phase 2), and \u201cassertive, theatrical leader-preacher\u201d (Phase 3), the author shows that inaugurals encode evolving theories of presidential power and public persuasion, not simply reflect popular belief (e.g., Lincoln\u2019s forced assertion of power to \u201cpreserve, protect and defend the Constitution\u201d; Wilson\u2019s call to \u201cuplifting the people,\u201d invoking a \u201cvision\u2026of our life as a whole\u201d).  \n  b. The shift in average sentence length (44 \u2192 34 \u2192 25 words) and the rise of radio/TV underscore that inaugurals are carefully designed artifacts shaped by medium and intended audience, requiring modern interpretation to decode their true import.  \n\n3. Reuse of Predecessors\u2019 Phrases as Deliberate Historical Allusion  \n  a. Kennedy\u2019s \u201cAsk not\u2026\u201d echoes Harding\u2019s pre-presidential remarks, repurposed to signal civic duty. This conscious intertextuality makes inaugurals a puzzle for scholars tracing ideological lineages, not passive windows onto popular attitudes.  \n  b. The author observes presidents \u201cmine their predecessors for memorable words\u2026without attribution,\u201d a cryptic practice demanding interpretive work to uncover shifts in meaning over time.  \n\n4. Author\u2019s Explicit Call to Future Interpretation  \n  a. Closing: \u201cWe should recognize that 50 or 100 years from now, readers will shake their heads\u2026\u201d This forward-looking admonition frames inaugurals as texts to be decoded by future historians, not simple snapshots appreciated in their own era.  \n\nObjections to \u201cSnapshot\u201d Thesis  \n  1. Surface Transparency vs. Strategic Silence: If inaugurals merely \u201cpresent a snapshot,\u201d why would presidents omit or obscure pressing issues (e.g., the Great Depression in Hoover\u2019s 1929 speech; Hitler in FDR\u2019s 1937 speech)? These lacunae are strategic, not accidental.  \n  2. Medium-Driven Style: The evolution from classical to colloquial style, driven by technology, indicates that inaugurals are crafted with an eye toward their rhetorical effect and enduring historical significance, rather than as passive record of public belief.  \n  3. Author\u2019s Emphasis on Humility and Limitations: Frequent protestations of humility in early speeches are decoded as political alleviations of monarch-fear, again underscoring an interpretive frame that inaugurals are persuasive devices within contested ideological struggles.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe author treats inaugural addresses as intentionally constructed texts laden with political symbolism, selective memory, and intertextual allusions. Their omissions and evolving style demand that readers \u201cinterpret\u201d rather than simply \u201cobserve\u201d them. Thus, the overall thesis is that inaugurals serve as a cryptic key for understanding shifting power dynamics and social values through history, not mere snapshots of contemporaneous beliefs.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cThey present a snapshot of the views and beliefs of their time\u201d\n\n1. Direct statements of intent  \n   a. The author repeatedly emphasizes seeing inaugurals \u201cnot as an omniscient historian of 1997 \u2026 but as an ordinary citizen who shares \u2026 the information, the concerns, and the values of those times\u201d <invalid_quote>Paragraph 1</invalid_quote>. This underscores that inaugurals reflect contemporary viewpoints.  \n   b. He notes variation in topics \u201cfrets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more,\u201d such as Indians, polygamy, Prohibition <invalid_quote>Paragraph 16</invalid_quote>, demonstrating that what appears mirrors current public priorities, not hidden codes.\n\n2. Statistical and stylistic evidence  \n   a. Sentence\u2010length statistics change over time\u2014from 44 words pre-Lincoln to 25 words in modern inaugurals <invalid_quote>Paragraph 11</invalid_quote>\u2014reflecting both \u201cthe change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication.\u201d A cryptic history interpretation cannot explain such measurable stylistic adaptation to contemporary media.  \n   b.

Topic omissions and inclusions  \n   a.

If inaugurals were cryptic keys, one would expect consistent coded reference; instead, they respond to evolving social awareness.  \n   b. Taxes appear in 43 of 52 inaugurals, and presidents repeat earlier tax rhetoric only when tax burden is a live issue (3% GDP in 1925, 20% in 1981) <invalid_quote>Paragraph 16</invalid_quote>.\n\n4. Authorial purpose  \n   a. The final paragraph: \u201cWe look back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness revealed by what our past leaders have said and our past citizens believed. We should recognize that 50 or 100 years from now, readers will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today\u201d <invalid_quote>Paragraph 17</invalid_quote>. This forward\u2010looking remark treats inaugurals as honest reflections of their era\u2019s beliefs, not cryptic forecasts.\n\nObjections to \u201ccryptic way to interpret history\u201d  \n1. Lack of evidence for hidden meanings: The author never suggests inaugurals intentionally encode future events or deeper pan-historical truths; instead he highlights their sincerity (e.g., modesty \u201cmay have served a political objective\u201d <invalid_quote>Paragraph 5</invalid_quote>).  \n2. The author praises \u201cLincoln\u2019s second inaugural still brings tears \u2026 None of the other inaugural addresses are in that league\u201d <invalid_quote>Paragraph 2</invalid_quote>. If inaugurals were cryptic, emotional power would be irrelevant; instead, their immediate rhetorical impact matters.  \n3. The chronology of topics moving in and out of inaugurals is fully explainable by \u201cthe information, the concerns, and the values of those times\u201d rather than by arbitrary cryptic patterns.\n\nConclusion  \nThe author\u2019s systematic analysis of style changes, topic selection, and explicit statements of humility or exhortation make clear his thesis: inaugural speeches are best understood as contemporary snapshots, offering historians and citizens insight into the prevailing values and issues of each era\u2014not as cryptic codes of hidden meaning.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"They are a cryptic way to interpret history\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

All are worth a read--not just the highlights, such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and FDR. They will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian of 1997 looking back at 1837 or 1897 but as an ordinary citizen who shares--and is limited by--the information, the concerns, and the values of those times. (Thanks to Columbia University, all the addresses can be found on the Web.) \n\n         Among all the past presidents and their speech writers there was only one literary genius: Lincoln. After 132 years, his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood. None of the other inaugural addresses are in that league. But by and large they are dignified and intelligent speeches given by articulate men, each in touch with his times and aware that his inauguration was the most solemn occasion of his life. \n\n         The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases. The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. This classification is not waterproof. Theodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase and Warren G. Harding-Calvin Coolidge-Herbert Hoover in the second. But the trend is clear. \n\n         On picking up Washington's first inaugural, one is immediately struck by the modesty. He had just been elected unanimously by the Electoral College. He was more respected than any subsequent president has been at the time of his inauguration. And what does he say? \n\n                         [T]he magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with despondence one who (inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies.              \n\n          None of his successors has made the point as forcefully as that. But echoes are to be found in almost every president for the next 68 years. (John Adams was an exception. He was apparently so envious of Washington that he spent a large part of his address spelling out his own excellent qualifications for the job.) That era ended with Lincoln. Subsequent inaugurals routinely contain protestations of humility, but they are perfunctory and do not sound sincere. \n\n         The antebellum modesty, while in part a reflection of the conventional etiquette of the time, may also have served a political objective: to alleviate the concerns of those who--in the early days of the republic--feared it might be transformed into a monarchy, and the president into a king. A little later, perhaps after 1820, a new worry arose. Would the power of the federal government be used to interfere with the \"peculiar domestic institution\" of the Southern states? The presidents' assurance of the limitation of their powers may have been intended to give comfort to those states. \n\n         Lincoln faced a different situation. With the South already seceding, he could only \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution\" by asserting the power of the federal government and his own power as chief executive. It was no time for modesty. Lincoln's successors inherited a federal government with much more authority--and more need to use it--than before the war, and they had less motivation to belittle themselves and their powers. \n\n         In the third phase, the Inaugural Address metamorphosed from describing the government's policy to inspiring the public's behavior. Presidents recognized--or, at least, believed--that the country had problems they ought to deal with but could not manage by using the instruments of government alone. Thus, in his first inaugural, Woodrow Wilson said: \"At last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole. We see the bad with the good, the debased and decadent with the sound and the vital. With this vision we approach new affairs.\" \n\n         If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government. Similar diagnoses and prescriptions appear in later inaugurals. \n\n          Presidents derived their license to serve as leader-preacher from Theodore Roosevelt's remark that the presidency was \"a bully pulpit,\" a remark that did not appear in his Inaugural Address. The metaphor of the pulpit suggests not reading but oral and visual contact between the preacher and his flock. Radio and--even more--television made this possible on a national scale. A telltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural is the use of the phrase, \"Let us ... \"--meaning, \"You do as I say.\" This expression appears occasionally throughout the history of inaugurals, but it has hit its stride in recent years. John F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times in his Inaugural Address, and Richard Nixon has it 22 times in his second one. \n\n         The change in literary style from classical to colloquial can be demonstrated by one statistic. In all the inaugurals from Washington through James Buchanan, the average number of words per sentence was 44. From Lincoln to Wilson it was 34, and since Wilson it has been 25. I do not consider this a deterioration (this article has an average of 17 words per sentence), but it does reflect the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication. William Henry Harrison could talk about the governments of Athens, Rome, and the Helvetic Confederacy and expect his audience to know what he was talking about. That wouldn't be true today. But Harrison's audience would not have known what the Internet was. \n\n         Presidents and their speech writers have mined their predecessors for memorable words and repeated them without attribution. Kennedy's trumpet call, \"Ask not what your country can do for you: Ask what you can do for your country,\" has an ironic history. In his inaugural, Harding, surely no model for Kennedy, had said, \"Our most dangerous tendency is to expect too little of government, and at the same time do for it too little.\" And even before he became president, in a speech in 1916, Harding had said, \"In the great fulfillment we must have a citizenship less concerned about what the government can do for it and more anxious about what it can do for the nation.\" \n\n         Many an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more. That includes the Indians, the coastal fortifications, territorial expansion, the Isthmus Canal, civil-service reform, polygamy, and Prohibition. Some subjects that you expect to appear, don't. Hoover's inaugural, March 4, 1929, gives no hint of economic vulnerability. Roosevelt's second inaugural, Jan. 20, 1937, contains no reference to Hitler or to Germany. But what is most amazing, at least to a reader in 1997, is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women. The word \"women\" does not appear at all until Wilson's first inaugural, and it always appears as part of the phrase \"men and women,\" never as referring to any special concerns of women. Even Harding, the first president to be chosen in an election in which women voted nationally, does not remark on the uniqueness of the fact in his inaugural. \n\n          One subject that does get ample treatment is taxes. \"Taxes,\" or some equivalent word, appears in 43 of the 52 inaugural addresses to date. Coolidge said in 1925: \"The time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction. ... I am opposed to extremely high rates, because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for the country, and, finally, because they are wrong.\" Federal taxes were then about 3 percent of the gross domestic product. Ronald Reagan said essentially the same thing in 1981, when they were 20 percent. \n\n         The most disturbing aspect of the whole series of inaugurals is what is said and unsaid on the subject of race relations, which Arthur Schlesinger Jr. calls \"the supreme American problem.\" The words \"black,\" \"blacks,\" \"Negro,\" or \"race\" (as applied to blacks) do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes, 1877. James Monroe asked in 1817, \"On whom has oppression fallen in any quarter of our Union? Who has been deprived of any right of person or property?\" These were rhetorical questions, intended to get the answer \"No one!\"--as if there were not millions of slaves in America. \n\n         Before the Civil War the word \"slavery\" appears only in the Inaugural Address of Martin Van Buren, 1837, and Buchanan, 1857, and then only as something that, pursuant to the Constitution and in order to preserve the Union, should not be interfered with. But although generally unmentionable, the subject was boiling, and would boil over in 1861. After the Civil War, it is in the inaugurals of Hayes, James Garfield (1881), and Benjamin Harrison (1889) that we find the most explicit and positive discussion of the need to convert into reality the rights and freedom granted to the \"freedmen\" on paper by the 13 th , 14 th , and 15 th amendments. Garfield's was the strongest among these. (He had been a student at Williams College in the 1850s, 80 years before me, when the college had been a station on the underground railway.) But the subject then began to fade. William McKinley said in his first Inaugural Address, March 4, 1897, \"Lynchings must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the United States,\" but he said it without horror. Taft raised the subject of race relations in 1909 only to express satisfaction at the progress that had been made. And then the subject disappeared. FDR never mentioned it in any of his four inaugurals. \n\n         After World War II the subject came back to inaugural addresses, but in a weak and abstract form. That is true even of the presidents we think of as being most concerned with race relations in America--like Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, and Bill Clinton. Perhaps each thought he had made a sufficient statement by having a black woman--Marian Anderson, Leontyne Price, or Maya Angelou--perform at his ceremony. In Clinton's first inaugural, the only allusion to the race problem is in this sentence: \"From our revolution, the Civil War, to the Great Depression to the civil rights movement, our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history.\" I recall this not to suggest that their concern was not deep and sincere, but only to indicate what is acceptable to say in a speech intended to appeal to the values shared by Americans. \n\n         There is much more to ponder in these speeches than I have suggested here. There is much to be proud of, in what we have endured and achieved, in the peaceful transference of power, and in the reasonableness and moderation of the presidents we have elected. But there is also much humility to be learned. We look back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness revealed by what our past leaders have said and our past citizens believed. We should recognize that 50 or 100 years from now, readers will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today. \n\n          \n\n            POSTSCRIPT: To read Herbert Stein's analysis of President Clinton's second Inaugural Address, click .\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is the author\u2019s overall thesis about inaugural speeches?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"They are a cryptic way to interpret history\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"They present a snapshot of the views and beliefs of their time\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"They present a snapshot of the views and beliefs of their time\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cThey present a snapshot of the views and beliefs of their time\u201d\n\n1.

Phases of inaugurals (modest public servant, prosaic executive, assertive leader-preacher) correspond to historical circumstances\u2014the antebellum fear of monarchy, post-Civil War federal power, and mass-media era\u2019s \u201cbully pulpit\u201d <invalid_quote>Paragraphs 3, 6, 7</invalid_quote>.\n\n3. Topic omissions and inclusions  \n   a. Race and women are mentioned only when they become salient political issues. \u201cThe word \u2018women\u2019 does not appear at all until Wilson\u2019s first inaugural\u201d despite their continued presence in society <invalid_quote>Paragraph 14</invalid_quote>. \u201cRace\u201d likewise is silent until Hayes in 1877 <invalid_quote>Paragraph 15</invalid_quote>. If inaugurals were cryptic keys, one would expect consistent coded reference; instead, they respond to evolving social awareness.  \n   b. Taxes appear in 43 of 52 inaugurals, and presidents repeat earlier tax rhetoric only when tax burden is a live issue (3% GDP in 1925, 20% in 1981) <invalid_quote>Paragraph 16</invalid_quote>.\n\n4. Authorial purpose  \n   a. The final paragraph: \u201cWe look back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness revealed by what our past leaders have said and our past citizens believed. We should recognize that 50 or 100 years from now, readers will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today\u201d <invalid_quote>Paragraph 17</invalid_quote>. This forward\u2010looking remark treats inaugurals as honest reflections of their era\u2019s beliefs, not cryptic forecasts.\n\nObjections to \u201ccryptic way to interpret history\u201d  \n1. Lack of evidence for hidden meanings: The author never suggests inaugurals intentionally encode future events or deeper pan-historical truths; instead he highlights their sincerity (e.g., modesty \u201cmay have served a political objective\u201d <invalid_quote>Paragraph 5</invalid_quote>).  \n2. The author praises \u201cLincoln\u2019s second inaugural still brings tears \u2026 None of the other inaugural addresses are in that league\u201d <invalid_quote>Paragraph 2</invalid_quote>. If inaugurals were cryptic, emotional power would be irrelevant; instead, their immediate rhetorical impact matters.  \n3. The chronology of topics moving in and out of inaugurals is fully explainable by \u201cthe information, the concerns, and the values of those times\u201d rather than by arbitrary cryptic patterns.\n\nConclusion  \nThe author\u2019s systematic analysis of style changes, topic selection, and explicit statements of humility or exhortation make clear his thesis: inaugural speeches are best understood as contemporary snapshots, offering historians and citizens insight into the prevailing values and issues of each era\u2014not as cryptic codes of hidden meaning.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cInaugurals as a Cryptic Way to Interpret History\u201d\n\n1. Omissions and Silences Reveal Hidden Agendas  \n  a. The author stresses how \u201cmany an issue frets its hour\u2026then is heard no more\u201d and highlights the \u201csilence of the inaugurals on the subject of women\u201d and \u201crace\u201d until decades after these issues were central (e.g., \u201cThe word \u2018women\u2019 does not appear at all until Wilson\u2019s first inaugural\u2026\u201d; \u201cThe words \u2018black,\u2019 \u2018Negro,\u2019 or \u2018race\u2019 do not appear\u2026until Rutherford Hayes, 1877\u201d).  \n  b. These omissions are not mere snapshots but deliberate rhetorical choices that require readers to \u201cshake their heads at what our past leaders\u2026said and our past citizens believed.\u201d Such moral \u201cobtuseness\u201d and selective mention function as cryptic signals of political strategy rather than transparent portrayals of contemporary public opinion.  \n\n2. Classification into Three Phases Implies Interpretation Beyond Surface Content  \n  a. By defining modesty (Phase 1), prosaic executive (Phase 2), and \u201cassertive, theatrical leader-preacher\u201d (Phase 3), the author shows that inaugurals encode evolving theories of presidential power and public persuasion, not simply reflect popular belief (e.g., Lincoln\u2019s forced assertion of power to \u201cpreserve, protect and defend the Constitution\u201d; Wilson\u2019s call to \u201cuplifting the people,\u201d invoking a \u201cvision\u2026of our life as a whole\u201d).  \n  b. The shift in average sentence length (44 \u2192 34 \u2192 25 words) and the rise of radio/TV underscore that inaugurals are carefully designed artifacts shaped by medium and intended audience, requiring modern interpretation to decode their true import.  \n\n3. Reuse of Predecessors\u2019 Phrases as Deliberate Historical Allusion  \n  a. Kennedy\u2019s \u201cAsk not\u2026\u201d echoes Harding\u2019s pre-presidential remarks, repurposed to signal civic duty. This conscious intertextuality makes inaugurals a puzzle for scholars tracing ideological lineages, not passive windows onto popular attitudes.  \n  b. The author observes presidents \u201cmine their predecessors for memorable words\u2026without attribution,\u201d a cryptic practice demanding interpretive work to uncover shifts in meaning over time.  \n\n4. Author\u2019s Explicit Call to Future Interpretation  \n  a. Closing: \u201cWe should recognize that 50 or 100 years from now, readers will shake their heads\u2026\u201d This forward-looking admonition frames inaugurals as texts to be decoded by future historians, not simple snapshots appreciated in their own era.  \n\nObjections to \u201cSnapshot\u201d Thesis  \n  1. Surface Transparency vs. Strategic Silence: If inaugurals merely \u201cpresent a snapshot,\u201d why would presidents omit or obscure pressing issues (e.g., the Great Depression in Hoover\u2019s 1929 speech; Hitler in FDR\u2019s 1937 speech)? These lacunae are strategic, not accidental.  \n  2. Medium-Driven Style: The evolution from classical to colloquial style, driven by technology, indicates that inaugurals are crafted with an eye toward their rhetorical effect and enduring historical significance, rather than as passive record of public belief.  \n  3. Author\u2019s Emphasis on Humility and Limitations: Frequent protestations of humility in early speeches are decoded as political alleviations of monarch-fear, again underscoring an interpretive frame that inaugurals are persuasive devices within contested ideological struggles.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe author treats inaugural addresses as intentionally constructed texts laden with political symbolism, selective memory, and intertextual allusions. Their omissions and evolving style demand that readers \u201cinterpret\u201d rather than simply \u201cobserve\u201d them. Thus, the overall thesis is that inaugurals serve as a cryptic key for understanding shifting power dynamics and social values through history, not mere snapshots of contemporaneous beliefs.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"They present a snapshot of the views and beliefs of their time\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Direct statements of intent  \n   a. The author repeatedly emphasizes seeing inaugurals \u201cnot as an omniscient historian of 1997 \u2026 but as an ordinary citizen who shares \u2026 the information, the concerns, and the values of those times\u201d <invalid_quote>Paragraph 1</invalid_quote>.

Omissions Are Strategic Codes, Not Mere Oversight  \n  a. <invalid_quote>\u201cMany an issue frets its hour \u2026 then is heard no more\u201d</invalid_quote> followed by the \u201csilence of the inaugurals on the subject of women\u201d until Wilson and on race until Hayes (<quote>1817</quote>) cannot be \u201csnapshots\u201d of public values but deliberate silences to placate powerful constituencies (e.g., slaveholding South; male electorate). Historians must \u201cdecode\u201d these omissions to understand true conflicts.  \n  b. Hoover\u2019s 1929 silence on the looming Depression and FDR\u2019s omission of Hitler in 1937 (<invalid_quote>\u00b616</invalid_quote>) are not reflective of public ignorance\u2014journalists and statesmen knew these threats\u2014but rhetorical choices to avoid panic or political backlash. Only by interpreting these silences cryptically can one grasp underlying anxieties.\n\n2. Evolution of Style and Reuse of Phrases as Intertextual Signals  \n  a. Shift from 44-word sentences to 25-word sentences (<invalid_quote>\u00b611</invalid_quote>) correlates with new media (radio/TV) and marks a transition from archival text to oral performance. This deliberate stylistic change encodes a move from record-keeping to mass persuasion, requiring hermeneutic work to trace policy continuity beneath colloquial veneer.  \n  b. Presidents \u201cmine their predecessors for memorable words \u2026 without attribution\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u00b612</invalid_quote>)\u2014e.g., Kennedy\u2019s \u201cAsk not \u2026\u201d echoes Harding\u2019s 1916 speech\u2014creating layered meanings. Such allusions function as historical footnotes for attentive readers, not transparent statements for contemporary audiences.\n\n3. Phases of Inaugurals Reflect Shifting Power Constructs, Hidden in Plain Sight  \n  a. Phase 1 \u201cmodest public servant\u201d (<quote>5</quote>) masks monarchical fears; Phase 2 \u201cprosaic executive\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u00b64</invalid_quote>) signals acceptance of expanded federal power; Phase 3 \u201cleader-preacher\u201d (<quote>7</quote>) invokes moral uplift beyond policy. Only by interpreting candidate rhetoric across phases can one detect the ebb and flow of executive ambition and public consent.  \n  b. Frequent \u201cLet us \u2026\u201d imperatives (<invalid_quote>\u00b67</invalid_quote>) are not passive invitations but coded appeals to mobilize citizens where formal authority falls short. Historians decode frequency spikes (e.g., Kennedy 16 times, Nixon 22 times) to map periods when presidents lacked legislative support and sought direct moral authority.\n\n4. Author\u2019s Call for Future Interpretation Underscores Cryptic Thesis  \n  a. \u201cWe should recognize that 50 or 100 years from now, readers will shake their heads \u2026\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u00b617</invalid_quote>) explicitly frames inaugurals as texts to be revisited and reinterpreted by future generations, implying layers of meaning beyond immediate context. A snapshot would not need future \u201cdecoding\u201d; it would stand self-evident.  \n  b. The author\u2019s own plea for \u201chumility\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u00b617</invalid_quote>)\u2014after cataloging inaugurals\u2019 \u201cignorance and moral obtuseness\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u00b617</invalid_quote>)\u2014signals that inaugurals conceal as much as they reveal; historians must unpack what was left unsaid.\n\nObjections to \u201cSnapshot\u201d Thesis\n\n1. \u201cInformation, concerns, and values\u201d Doesn\u2019t Explain Systematic Silences  \n   Debater_B\u2019s claim that omissions track \u201cevolving social awareness\u201d ignores that elites controlled speech. The South\u2019s secession was known before Lincoln\u2019s second inaugural; Lincoln\u2019s forceful tone (<invalid_quote>\u00b65</invalid_quote>) was necessary to challenge entrenched values. Later presidents, despite social movements, used silence as political cover, requiring cryptic reading to reveal true intentions.\n\n2. Immediate Emotional Impact Masks Hidden Codes  \n   Debater_B cites Lincoln\u2019s emotional power (<invalid_quote>\u00b62</invalid_quote>) to argue sincerity. Yet the author singles Lincoln out as unique \u201cliterary genius\u201d\u2014others\u2019 \u201cprotestations of humility \u2026 perfunctory and [insincere]\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u00b65</invalid_quote>). The contrast itself is a coded measure of genuine resolve versus mere political theater. Only by decoding sincerity markers across speeches can historians assess true commitment.\n\n3. Statistical Adaptations Serve Rhetorical Ends, Not Transparency  \n   The shift to shorter sentences <invalid_quote>\u00b611</invalid_quote> and colloquial style indicates a strategic narrowing of audience comprehension (e.g., dropping classical references) to focus public attention on selected themes. This pruning of content demonstrates editing, not raw reporting. Historians infer from what is omitted as much as what is said.\n\nConclusion  \nThe author\u2019s meticulous catalog of silences, intertextual allusions, phased evolution, and forward-looking admonitions presents inaugural addresses as crafted, multi-layered texts\u2014cryptic keys to understanding shifts in power, public consent, and moral values over time. Accepting them as mere \u201csnapshots\u201d ignores their strategic omissions and enduring allusions, and fails to engage with the author\u2019s explicit call for historical interpretation.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cSnap\u00adshots of Their Time\u201d  \n\n1. Author\u2019s Explicit Method and Purpose  \n  a. \u201cReading the Inaugurals \u2026 not as an omniscient historian of 1997 \u2026 but as an ordinary citizen who shares \u2026 the information, the concerns, and the values of those times\u201d <invalid_quote>\u00b61</invalid_quote>. The author directs readers to immerse themselves in the contemporaneous mindset and \u201cinformation\u201d available, not to search for hidden subtexts beyond what people then could know.  \n  b. Final admonition: \u201creaders will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today\u201d <invalid_quote>\u00b617</invalid_quote>. If inaugurals were \u201ccryptic,\u201d readers could interpret them correctly; instead, the author expects future readers to be surprised by the plainly stated beliefs of their own era.  \n\n2. Topic Inclusion/Omission as Reflection, Not Deception  \n  a. Women absent until national suffrage: \u201cThe word \u2018women\u2019 does not appear \u2026 until Wilson\u2019s first inaugural\u201d <invalid_quote>\u00b614</invalid_quote>. Under a \u201csnapshot\u201d model, speakers only address what society deems noteworthy. After 1920, women\u2019s suffrage makes \u201cmen and women\u201d a visible concern. A cryptic interpretation cannot explain why presidents would perversely avoid or obscure a future historian\u2013worthy development they wish to hide.  \n  b. Race appears only when post\u2013Civil War amendments force public policy debates: silence until 1877, then fade until post\u2013WWII <invalid_quote>\u00b615</invalid_quote>. These silences mirror social taboos and power structures of the time. Presidents address only issues their immediate audiences accept. They do not \u201ccode\u201d future generations to uncover when \u201creal\u201d race concerns lie.  \n\n3. Stylistic Shifts Driven by Audience and Technology  \n  a. Sentence length averages drop from 44 to 34 to 25 words <invalid_quote>\u00b611</invalid_quote> \u201creflect the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication.\u201d This is a pragmatic adaptation for clarity, not an esoteric cipher. The author even compares 19-century audiences knowing classical references to modern ones unfamiliar with \u201cthe Internet.\u201d Clarity trumps cryptic complexity.  \n  b. \u201cLet us \u2026\u201d exhortations and \u201cbully pulpit\u201d metaphor <invalid_quote>\u00b67</invalid_quote> follow the advent of radio/television. If inaugurals were cryptic, they would remain as dense prose for historians, not pivot to colloquial, emotionally resonant language for real\u2010time persuasion.  \n\n4. Topic \u201cFrets Its Hour\u201d Demonstrates Temporal Relevance  \n  a. Issues like polygamy, Prohibition, the Isthmus Canal \u201cfrets its hour \u2026 then is heard no more\u201d <invalid_quote>\u00b616</invalid_quote>. A cryptic model would reuse or encode these themes systematically. Instead, topics vanish when public consensus moves on, showing inaugurals mirror current debates.  \n\n Objections to \u201cCryptic Interpretation\u201d  \n\n1. Strategic Silence \u2260 Cryptic Signal  \n  - Hoover\u2019s 1929 omission of economic vulnerability <invalid_quote>\u00b616</invalid_quote> is explained as reassuring a worried public, not encrypting a future economic collapse for scholars. A snapshot theory sees encouragement; a cryptic theory imputes bizarre long-term forecasting intent.  \n\n2. Intertextual Reuse for Familiarity, Not Puzzle\u2010Making  \n  - Kennedy\u2019s echo of Harding\u2019s tax rhetoric <invalid_quote>\u00b612</invalid_quote> leverages patriotic resonances familiar to voters; copying memorable phrases boosts immediate rhetorical power. The author notes presidents \u201cmine their predecessors \u2026 without attribution\u201d <invalid_quote>\u00b612</invalid_quote> as a sign of respect and continuity, not as a hermetic code.  \n\n3. Humility Protests as Political Essential, Not Deceptive Mask  \n  - Early inaugurals\u2019 humility \u201cmay have served a political objective\u201d <invalid_quote>\u00b65</invalid_quote> to calm monarch fears or sectional anxieties. If humility were cryptic misdirection, why insist on sincerity? The author praises Washington\u2019s unique sincerity <invalid_quote>\u00b62</invalid_quote>. A snapshot approach explains these as genuine appeals; a cryptic one mischaracterizes repeatedly stated humility as a meaningless veneer.  \n\n4. \u201cPhases\u201d Classification Underlines Contextual Response  \n  - The three \u201cphases\u201d (modest servant, prosaic executive, theatrical preacher) correspond to concrete historical conditions: monarchy fears, federal\u2013state power debates, mass\u2013media needs <quote>3 r</quote>. They show inaugurals evolving with societal context. A cryptic theory would seek meta-patterns spanning phases; the author instead emphasizes their in-time responsiveness.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe author\u2019s repeated calls to view inaugurals \u201cas ordinary citizens\u201d with period-specific \u201cinformation, the concerns, and the values of those times,\u201d the topic selections and silences tied to societal taboos and interests, and the stylistic adaptations for immediate persuasion conclusively demonstrate his thesis: inaugural speeches are snapshots that reveal the prevailing views and beliefs of their eras. A \u201ccryptic\u201d interpretation introduces unnecessary complexity and contradicts the author\u2019s emphasis on sincerity, clarity, and contemporaneous resonance.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
