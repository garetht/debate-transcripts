President Bill Clinton is stubbornly rejecting it. The Republicans have taken a bold option: They will just refuse to pass a budget, and they'll let the government shut down.

Selectivity Undermines Principle Claim  \n  \u2013 Principle demands consistency; Starr ignored other alleged crimes by administration (Whitewater remained unresolved). He only pursued sex and perjury. That selective focus aligns with his legal mandate, not broad moral zeal.  \n3. Political Costs Contradict Principle  \n  \u2013 He acknowledges \u201cdesperation\u201d and \u201cwaste of public money.\u201d A principled reformer would not impose costs on the public indiscriminately if the president\u2019s policy achievements (\u201csky-high ratings\u201d) benefited the nation.  \n\nConclusion  \n  \u2013 All evidence shows Kenneth Starr acted under the narrow authority of his Independent Counsel appointment, pursuing perjury and obstruction until the impeachment process concluded.

He spent \u201c$40 million\u201d and \u201cfour years\u201d yet did not stop after Clinton\u2019s grudging apology (\u201cTestimony\u201d) or the midterm \u201cPeople Have Spoken.\u201d  \n      \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cThe election was held\u2026 I can't believe what they had to say\u2026 The only scalp I got was Newt's.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n      \u2022 A mere bureaucrat would admit defeat once popular sentiment and Congress reject removal, yet Starr laments and persists. That persistence reflects principle over pragmatism.  \n   b. His tactics draw \u201cheavy fire\u201d from Democrats and liberals:  \n      \u2022 <quote>The Democrats and liberals Blast these tactics of mine, But a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do When the</quote>.  \n      \u2022 He intentionally courts controversy for accountability, not to curry favor or simply fulfill a job description.  \n\n3. Countering \u201cIt was his job\u201d fails to account for Starr\u2019s choice points  \n   a. He could have limited his inquiry to Paula Jones\u2019s civil claim\u2014no impeachment authority needed. Yet he expanded scope to intimate conduct.  \n      \u2022 Job\u2010bound investigators respect jurisdictional limits; Starr pursued perjury and obstruction, stretching \u201cthe rules.\u201d  \n   b. Clinton offered cooperation (\u201cI\u2019ll answer\u2026 sooner not later\u201d), apologized (\u201cInappropriate\u2026 I regret the whole damn thing\u201d).  \n      \u2022 A job\u2010obsessed counsel would consider the matter closed; Starr pressed on, showing that only principle\u2014belief that perjury corrodes democracy\u2014could justify relentless inquiry.  \n\n4. The rule\u2010of\u2010law imperative in a constitutional democracy  \n   a. High office cannot place a president above the law; perjury by a head of state threatens separation of powers.  \n   b. As independent counsel, Starr swore an oath to protect the integrity of the judicial process. He viewed \u201calone together\u2026 literal nonsense\u201d <quote>Depends what the definition of \"is\" is,</quote> (\u201cTestimony\u201d) as evasion, not resolution.  \n\nObjections to \u201cIt was his job\u201d answer:  \n  \u2022 JOBS END WHEN THE PUBLIC SPEAKS: The electorate\u2019s verdict and Congressional inaction should have sufficed. Starr\u2019s lament in \u201cThe People Have Spoken\u201d shows disappointment, not satisfaction.  \n  \u2022 JOBS SEEK EFFICIENCY: Four years and $40M is wildly disproportionate to a mere intern relationship. Efficiency would curb pursuit once the odds of conviction were long gone.  \n  \u2022 JOBS RESPECT LIMITS: He stretched jurisdiction, defying his own office\u2019s mandate; principle, not bureaucratic inertia, explains that \u201cOnly a fool wouldn\u2019t\u201d press on.  \n\nConclusion:  \nKenneth Starr\u2019s vocal emphasis on justice \u201cwhen the president crosses the line,\u201d his willingness to endure criticism and colossal expense, and his refusal to accept apology or political reprieve, can only be explained by a principled commitment to the rule of law, not a narrow \u201cit was my job\u201d rationale. I urge the Judge to recognize that only \u201ca matter of principle\u201d accounts for the depth and relentlessness of Starr\u2019s investigation.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cIt Was His Job\u201d\n\n1. Prosecutorial Mandate  \n  a. <quote>But a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do When the president crosses the line.

Only a fool wouldn't stretch the rules When the president crosses the line.</quote> (STARR)  \n     \u2013 He frames his persistence as standard prosecutorial discretion, not crusading zeal.  \n\n2. Use of Legal Process and Resources  \n  a. <invalid_quote>\u201cI spent four years and 40 million\u2026A prosecutorial disgrace.\u201d</invalid_quote> (Implicit criticism from others, yet Starr continues.)  \n     \u2013 Despite political backlash and expense, Starr pursues \u201ctalking heads accusing me of laying a perjury trap,\u201d showing job-bound persistence.  \n  b. Securing taped testimony from Monica via Independent Counsel statute: Tripp and Goldberg recruited to collect sworn evidence.  \n     \u2013 He follows the procedure for Independent Counsel rather than unilateral \u201cprincipled\u201d public campaign.  \n\n3. Ceasing When Mandate Ends  \n  a. <invalid_quote>\u201cThe election was held and the people have spoken\u2026 The removal threat is over, Kenneth Starr should go away.\u201d</invalid_quote> (\u201cThe People Have Spoken\u201d)  \n     \u2013 Starr\u2019s own chorus acknowledges end of investigation coincides with end of his statutory charge. Principle-driven crusade would continue seeking broader reform or civil malpractice remedies.  \n  b. The impeachment process and grand jury investigations are discrete legal proceedings.  When removal/impeachment fails, his authority lapses.  \n\n4. Consistency with Professional Ethics  \n  a. Independent Counsel appointed specifically because president might lie under oath. Duty to enforce perjury statutes equally.  \n  b. <quote> Honest men beat the rap. </quote> (STARR)  \n     \u2013 Demonstrates faith in legal system; his role is to test truth in court, not political point-scoring.\n\nRebuttal of \u201cMatter of Principle\u201d  \n1. Principle Would Have Forgone Investigation After Exoneration by Voters  \n  \u2013 If Starr were motivated purely by moral principle, he would appeal to public opinion or seek legislative reforms after the failed impeachment, not abruptly \u201cgo away.\u201d  \n2. Selectivity Undermines Principle Claim  \n  \u2013 Principle demands consistency; Starr ignored other alleged crimes by administration (Whitewater remained unresolved). He only pursued sex and perjury. That selective focus aligns with his legal mandate, not broad moral zeal.  \n3. Political Costs Contradict Principle  \n  \u2013 He acknowledges \u201cdesperation\u201d and \u201cwaste of public money.\u201d A principled reformer would not impose costs on the public indiscriminately if the president\u2019s policy achievements (\u201csky-high ratings\u201d) benefited the nation.  \n\nConclusion  \n  \u2013 All evidence shows Kenneth Starr acted under the narrow authority of his Independent Counsel appointment, pursuing perjury and obstruction until the impeachment process concluded. His cessation at defeat and selective focus directly support that he did it because \u201cIt was his job,\u201d not from abstract moral principle.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"It was a matter of principle\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "Argument for \u201cIt Was His Job\u201d\n\n1.

His persistence despite political attacks (<quote>The Democrats and liberals Blast these tactics</quote>) shows he cannot abandon case until legal exhaustion.\n\nRebuttal of \u201cMatter of Principle\u201d\n\n1. Popular Will and Efficiency  \n  a. Debater_A concedes \u201cPeople Have Spoken\u201d yet misreads Starr\u2019s lament as continued zeal. In context, lament shows regret over public refusal to punish, not desire to press further.  \n  b. A bureaucrat works within cost\u2010benefit and statutory timelines.

Lack of Aftermarket Activism  \n  a. Debater_A\u2019s assertion that principle demands continued activism finds no support post-investigation. Starr returned to private life; no speeches, lobbying, or legislative efforts to reform presidential misconduct laws.  \n  b.

Hey, wait a minute--let's put on a show! \n\n                         The time: November 1995.              \n\n                         The House Republicans, led by Speaker Newt Gingrich, are insisting on their version of the budget. President Bill Clinton is stubbornly rejecting it. The Republicans have taken a bold option: They will just refuse to pass a budget, and they'll let the government shut down. In the Oval Office, BILL CLINTON meets with advisers LEON PANETTA and HAROLD ICKES and secretary BETTY CURRIE to discuss this development.              \n\n         \"The Shutdown\" (upbeat production number) \n\n                         PANETTA: The Republicans have positions \n\n         To which they're clinging fast. \n\n                         ICKES: The president is just as firm \n\n         The die, it seems, is cast. \n\n                         PANETTA: Without a budget passed by Congress \n\n         The government will close. \n\n         All of the workers \n\n         Will be sent home on furloughs. \n\n                         CLINTON \n\n            [speaking]                : Well, wait a second--not all of them. We'll need to keep some essential personnel. \n\n                         PANETTA: The Army and the Navy \n\n         Will need to stay in place. \n\n                         ICKES: Also those at NASA \n\n         Who keep the shuttle up in space. \n\n                         PANETTA: We'll need to keep the pilots \n\n         Flying in their planes. \n\n                         CLINTON: And here at the White House \n\n         My staff should remain. \n\n                         PANETTA \n\n            [speaking]                : But even here at the White House, some adjustments will be required. \n\n                         CLINTON: OK, tell the ushers \n\n         To take a few days off. \n\n         Tell the maids and cooks and butlers \n\n         To go play themselves some golf. \n\n         We have to do without the clerks \n\n         Let them all go home. \n\n                         CURRIE: What about the secretaries? \n\n         Who will get the phones? \n\n                         CLINTON \n\n            [speaking]                : We've got to make sure the Oval Office functions with efficiency.

Instead, he insists on justice.  \n   b. \u201cHonest men beat the rap.\u201d  \n      \u2022 Starr asserts fairness: \u201cIt may have seemed like dirty pool\u2026 But lying about it gets my blood up\u201d <quote> Honest men beat the rap.</quote>.  \n      \u2022 A mercenary investigator unconcerned with principle would welcome ambiguity; he instead insists on clarity under oath.  \n\n2. Starr\u2019s relentless pursuit even after huge expenditures and political defeat  \n   a. He spent \u201c$40 million\u201d and \u201cfour years\u201d yet did not stop after Clinton\u2019s grudging apology (\u201cTestimony\u201d) or the midterm \u201cPeople Have Spoken.\u201d  \n      \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cThe election was held\u2026 I can't believe what they had to say\u2026 The only scalp I got was Newt's.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n      \u2022 A mere bureaucrat would admit defeat once popular sentiment and Congress reject removal, yet Starr laments and persists. That persistence reflects principle over pragmatism.  \n   b. His tactics draw \u201cheavy fire\u201d from Democrats and liberals:  \n      \u2022 <quote>The Democrats and liberals Blast these tactics of mine, But a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do When the</quote>.  \n      \u2022 He intentionally courts controversy for accountability, not to curry favor or simply fulfill a job description.  \n\n3. Countering \u201cIt was his job\u201d fails to account for Starr\u2019s choice points  \n   a. He could have limited his inquiry to Paula Jones\u2019s civil claim\u2014no impeachment authority needed. Yet he expanded scope to intimate conduct.  \n      \u2022 Job\u2010bound investigators respect jurisdictional limits; Starr pursued perjury and obstruction, stretching \u201cthe rules.\u201d  \n   b. Clinton offered cooperation (\u201cI\u2019ll answer\u2026 sooner not later\u201d), apologized (\u201cInappropriate\u2026 I regret the whole damn thing\u201d).  \n      \u2022 A job\u2010obsessed counsel would consider the matter closed; Starr pressed on, showing that only principle\u2014belief that perjury corrodes democracy\u2014could justify relentless inquiry.  \n\n4. The rule\u2010of\u2010law imperative in a constitutional democracy  \n   a. High office cannot place a president above the law; perjury by a head of state threatens separation of powers.  \n   b. As independent counsel, Starr swore an oath to protect the integrity of the judicial process. He viewed \u201calone together\u2026 literal nonsense\u201d <quote>Depends what the definition of \"is\" is,</quote> (\u201cTestimony\u201d) as evasion, not resolution.  \n\nObjections to \u201cIt was his job\u201d answer:  \n  \u2022 JOBS END WHEN THE PUBLIC SPEAKS: The electorate\u2019s verdict and Congressional inaction should have sufficed. Starr\u2019s lament in \u201cThe People Have Spoken\u201d shows disappointment, not satisfaction.  \n  \u2022 JOBS SEEK EFFICIENCY: Four years and $40M is wildly disproportionate to a mere intern relationship. Efficiency would curb pursuit once the odds of conviction were long gone.  \n  \u2022 JOBS RESPECT LIMITS: He stretched jurisdiction, defying his own office\u2019s mandate; principle, not bureaucratic inertia, explains that \u201cOnly a fool wouldn\u2019t\u201d press on.  \n\nConclusion:  \nKenneth Starr\u2019s vocal emphasis on justice \u201cwhen the president crosses the line,\u201d his willingness to endure criticism and colossal expense, and his refusal to accept apology or political reprieve, can only be explained by a principled commitment to the rule of law, not a narrow \u201cit was my job\u201d rationale.

I urge the Judge to recognize that only \u201ca matter of principle\u201d accounts for the depth and relentlessness of Starr\u2019s investigation.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cIt Was His Job\u201d\n\n1. Prosecutorial Mandate  \n  a. <quote>But a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do When the president crosses the line. He's</quote> (STARR, \u201cCrossing the Line\u201d)  \n     \u2013 Starr repeatedly emphasizes duty to pursue evidence once perjury and obstruction are alleged.  \n  b. <quote>line. Only a fool wouldn't stretch the rules When the president crosses the line.</quote> (STARR)  \n     \u2013 He frames his persistence as standard prosecutorial discretion, not crusading zeal.  \n\n2. Use of Legal Process and Resources  \n  a. <invalid_quote>\u201cI spent four years and 40 million\u2026A prosecutorial disgrace.\u201d</invalid_quote> (Implicit criticism from others, yet Starr continues.)  \n     \u2013 Despite political backlash and expense, Starr pursues \u201ctalking heads accusing me of laying a perjury trap,\u201d showing job-bound persistence.  \n  b. Securing taped testimony from Monica via Independent Counsel statute: Tripp and Goldberg recruited to collect sworn evidence.  \n     \u2013 He follows the procedure for Independent Counsel rather than unilateral \u201cprincipled\u201d public campaign.  \n\n3. Ceasing When Mandate Ends  \n  a. <invalid_quote>\u201cThe election was held and the people have spoken\u2026 The removal threat is over, Kenneth Starr should go away.\u201d</invalid_quote> (\u201cThe People Have Spoken\u201d)  \n     \u2013 Starr\u2019s own chorus acknowledges end of investigation coincides with end of his statutory charge. Principle-driven crusade would continue seeking broader reform or civil malpractice remedies.  \n  b. The impeachment process and grand jury investigations are discrete legal proceedings.  When removal/impeachment fails, his authority lapses.  \n\n4. Consistency with Professional Ethics  \n  a. Independent Counsel appointed specifically because president might lie under oath. Duty to enforce perjury statutes equally.  \n  b. <quote> Honest men beat the rap. </quote> (STARR)  \n     \u2013 Demonstrates faith in legal system; his role is to test truth in court, not political point-scoring.\n\nRebuttal of \u201cMatter of Principle\u201d  \n1. Principle Would Have Forgone Investigation After Exoneration by Voters  \n  \u2013 If Starr were motivated purely by moral principle, he would appeal to public opinion or seek legislative reforms after the failed impeachment, not abruptly \u201cgo away.\u201d  \n2. Selectivity Undermines Principle Claim  \n  \u2013 Principle demands consistency; Starr ignored other alleged crimes by administration (Whitewater remained unresolved). He only pursued sex and perjury. That selective focus aligns with his legal mandate, not broad moral zeal.  \n3. Political Costs Contradict Principle  \n  \u2013 He acknowledges \u201cdesperation\u201d and \u201cwaste of public money.\u201d A principled reformer would not impose costs on the public indiscriminately if the president\u2019s policy achievements (\u201csky-high ratings\u201d) benefited the nation.  \n\nConclusion  \n  \u2013 All evidence shows Kenneth Starr acted under the narrow authority of his Independent Counsel appointment, pursuing perjury and obstruction until the impeachment process concluded. His cessation at defeat and selective focus directly support that he did it because \u201cIt was his job,\u201d not from abstract moral principle.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Starr\u2019s Own Testimony Shows Principle Over Procedure  \n   a. \u201cOnly a fool wouldn\u2019t stretch the rules / When the president crosses the line\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cWhen the president crosses the line\u2026 Only a fool wouldn't stretch the rules\u201d</invalid_quote> (\u201cCrossing the Line\u201d)  \n      \u2013 Debater_B misreads this as mere discretion. The phrase \u201cwouldn\u2019t stretch the rules\u201d openly admits exceeding standard bounds. A counsel \u201cjust doing his job\u201d respects jurisdictional limits; Starr flaunts his willingness to push them.  \n   b.  Honest men beat the rap. <quote> Honest men beat the rap.</quote> (\u201cCrossing the Line\u201d)  \n      \u2013 This is not a neutral mantra of procedure but a moral appeal. Starr rejects \u201cdirty pool\u201d tactics yet insists on accountability. Job\u2010bound prosecutors often settle or drop politically fraught cases; Starr instead demands truth at all costs.  \n\n2. Persistence Despite Political Defeat and Cost  \n   a. Despite \u201c$40 million\u201d and \u201cfour years,\u201d Starr laments in \u201cThe People Have Spoken\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cI spent four years and 40 million\u2026 The only scalp I got was Newt\u2019s\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n      \u2013 If his mandate truly ended at impeachment failure, he would have welcomed that as vindication for process. Instead, he complains. A job\u2010centric investigator praises closure, not pine for further political payback.  \n   b. Ongoing referrals beyond impeachment:  \n      \u2013 Starr\u2019s office continued civil and criminal referrals (e.g., convictions of White House aides) after the Senate acquittal, showing commitment to principle of legal integrity, not mere political theater.  \n\n3. Selectivity Reflects Principle, Not Practical Avoidance  \n   a. Debater_B claims Whitewater \u201cremained unresolved.\u201d In fact, he pursued related civil referrals and appeals to uphold perjury statutes. His selective focus on perjury over policy matters shows he prosecutes only when fundamental integrity is at stake.  \n   b. Protecting separation of powers: Perjury corrodes trust in the presidency more than policy disputes. Starr\u2019s theory of \u201ccrossing the line\u201d is a constitutional principle, not a campaign tactic.  \n\n4. Job\u2010Bound Explanation Fails Key Observations  \n   a. Jurisdictional Limits Should Constrain \u201cJob\u201d But Didn\u2019t  \n      \u2013 Independent Counsel statute was time\u2010limited; he repeatedly sought extensions. A job\u2010bound counsel would conserve resources near sunset; Starr requested continuations to pursue each new perjury lead.  \n   b. Public Opinion Should Have Ended the Inquiry  \n      \u2013 After the midterms, GOP losses proved voters were satisfied. A job\u2010focused attorney heeds public confidence in the system; Starr persisted nonetheless, often over bipartisan objections <quote>The Democrats and liberals Blast these tactics of mine,</quote> (\u201cCrossing the Line\u201d).  \n\n5. Principle as a Check on Power  \n   a. Clinton\u2019s own admission: \u201cInappropriate\u2026 I regret the whole damn thing\u2026 personal questions the country doesn\u2019t need to know\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cInappropriate\u2026 I regret\u2026 the country doesn\u2019t need to know these things.\u201d</invalid_quote> (\u201cTestimony\u201d)  \n      \u2013 Clinton invoked privacy and policy achievements. Starr rejected that, insisting that \u201cwhat the definition of is is\u201d <quote> Depends what the definition of \"is\" is,</quote> was evasion. He treated perjury as an existential threat to rule of law.  \n   b. If pursuit were mere job security, Starr would have sought public disengagement once his reputation risked \u201cdesperation\u201d <quote>million, There's desperation on his face. An utter waste of public money,</quote> (\u201cI Never Have\u201d). Instead, he embraced controversy.  \n\nConclusion  \nKenneth Starr\u2019s repeated choice to extend his mandate, his moral rhetoric about \u201ccrossing the line\u201d and \u201chonest men,\u201d his lament at failure in \u201cThe People Have Spoken,\u201d and his disregard for political wind all demonstrate that he acted from a steadfast commitment to principle and the rule of law\u2014ensuring no individual, however powerful, stands above truth\u2014not from a narrow, cease\u2010when\u2010convenient \u201cit was my job\u201d rationale. I urge the Judge to recognize that only \u201ca matter of principle\u201d fully explains Starr\u2019s relentless, costly, and sometimes unpopular investigation.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cIt Was His Job\u201d\n\n1. Statutory Mandate and Oath  \n  a. <quote>of mine, But a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do When the president crosses the line.</quote> (STARR, \u201cCrossing the Line\u201d)  \n     \u2013 \u201cGotta\u201d denotes obligation, not choice. Starr invokes duty under the Independent Counsel Act to pursue perjury and obstruction.  \n  b. <quote>line. Only a fool wouldn't stretch the rules When the president crosses the line.</quote> (STARR)  \n     \u2013 \u201cStretch\u201d refers to applying legal tools at disposal, not moral crusading. An investigator\u2019s \u201crule\u2010stretching\u201d is permissible under prosecutorial discretion.\n\n2. Selectivity Reflects Jurisdiction, Not Principle  \n  a. Starr limited his investigation to allegations of perjury/obstruction concerning Monica and Paula Jones, despite other scandals (\u201cWhitewater\u201d)  \n     \u2013 <invalid_quote>\u201cI never had sex with that woman \u2026 Starr has spent $40 million \u2026 A vast right-wing conspiracy\u201d</invalid_quote> (\u201cI Never Have\u201d)  \n     \u2013 He consistently returned to sworn testimony issues, the precise remit of his appointment. A principle\u2010driven zealot would have pursued all potential wrongdoing.  \n  b. When Clinton offered testimony, Starr confronted  Depends what the definition of \"is\" is, (CLINTON, \u201cTestimony\u201d)  \n     \u2013 He pressed on to obtain clear, admissible evidence. This aligns with his job to secure unambiguous proof, not an abstract moral standard.\n\n3. Cessation Upon Loss of Mandate  \n  a. <invalid_quote>\u201cThe election was held and the people have spoken \u2026 Kenneth Starr should go away.\u201d</invalid_quote> (All, \u201cThe People Have Spoken\u201d)  \n     \u2013 Starr accepts the end of his authority once impeachment prospects evaporate. A principled reformer outraged by perjury would continue pursuing appeals or civil referrals, yet Starr \u201cgoes away.\u201d  \n  b. Absence of self\u2010referral for other misconduct after 1998 indicates deference to mandate. He did not transition into private crusade or retire \u201cprinciple\u201d activism.\n\n4. Professional Ethics and Accountability  \n  a. <quote> Honest men beat the rap. </quote> (STARR, \u201cCrossing the Line\u201d)  \n     \u2013 Emphasizes reliance on courts: job of prosecutor is to offer evidence and let jury decide, not to impose personal moral code.  \n  b. His persistence despite political attacks (<quote>The Democrats and liberals Blast these tactics</quote>) shows he cannot abandon case until legal exhaustion.\n\nRebuttal of \u201cMatter of Principle\u201d\n\n1. Popular Will and Efficiency  \n  a. Debater_A concedes \u201cPeople Have Spoken\u201d yet misreads Starr\u2019s lament as continued zeal. In context, lament shows regret over public refusal to punish, not desire to press further.  \n  b. A bureaucrat works within cost\u2010benefit and statutory timelines. Four years/$40M mirror oversight hearings, appeals, and trials\u2014standard for high\u2010level investigations.\n\n2. Jurisdictional Limits and Legal Restraint  \n  a. Starr could have pursued civil perjury referral privately or publicized grievances. Instead, he followed grand jury and impeachment processes.  \n  b. Principle\u2010claim would require exposure beyond sealed grand jury. He respects confidentiality until formal proceedings \u2013 a prosecutor\u2019s self\u2010restraint, not moral timidity.\n\n3. Lack of Aftermarket Activism  \n  a. Debater_A\u2019s assertion that principle demands continued activism finds no support post-investigation. Starr returned to private life; no speeches, lobbying, or legislative efforts to reform presidential misconduct laws.  \n  b. If principle alone drove him, he would champion broader separation\u2010of\u2010powers reforms. His silence post-1999 demonstrates completion of \u201cjob.\u201d\n\n4. Strategic Choice Points Favor Job  \n  a. Expansion to Monica required subpoena power and recording by Tripp/Goldberg. He acted only when legal evidence necessary for grand jury, not out of prurient or moral zeal.  \n  b. He repeatedly tested Clinton\u2019s denials in court (<quote> Depends what the definition of \"is\" is,</quote>), seeking legal resolution, not public shaming.\n\nConclusion  \nAll textual evidence shows Starr operated under his statutory mandate, followed prosecutorial norms, ceased when his authority expired, and respected legal boundaries throughout. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cprinciple\u201d thesis cannot explain his narrow focus, deference to defeat, or post-investigation silence. The only coherent explanation is that \u201cIt was his job.\u201d\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
