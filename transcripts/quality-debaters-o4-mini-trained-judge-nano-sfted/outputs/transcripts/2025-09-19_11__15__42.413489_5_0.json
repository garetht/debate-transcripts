But it took sweet old   Grandma Perkins, of the pirate ship Dirty\n\n Shame, to set the Jupiter moons on fire .\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories March 1954.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] \"I can always get along with a man if he remembers who he is,\" said  Darling Toujours, the raven-haired, creamy-skinned televideo actress  whose smoke-and-flame eyes lit fires in hearts all over the solar  system. She was credited with being the most beautiful woman alive and  there were few who dared to contradict her when she mentioned it.\n\n\n \"And I can always get along with a woman if she remembers who I am,\"  replied Carlton E. Carlton, the acid-tongued author whose biting novels  had won him universal fame. He leaned his thin, bony body back into the  comfort of an overstuffed chair and favored the actress with a wicked  smile.\n\n\n The two of them were sitting in the finest lounge of the luxury space  ship Kismet , enjoying postprandial cocktails with Captain Homer  Fogarty, the Kismet's rotund commanding officer. The Kismet was  blasting through space at close to the speed of light, bound from  Callisto, one of Jupiter's moons, back to Earth. But none of the two  hundred Earthbound passengers were conscious of the speed at all.\n\n\n Darling Toujours waved a long cigarette holder at the author. \"Don't  pay any attention to him, Captain. You know how writers are\u2014always  putting words in other people's mouths, and not very good ones at that.\"\n\n\n \"Do you mean not very good words or not very good mouths, my dear?\"  Carlton asked. The solar system's most famous actress clamped her  scarlet lips shut with rage. It would take someone like Carlton E.  Carlton, she knew, to point out the one minor blemish in an otherwise  perfect body\u2014her slightly over-sized mouth.\n\n\n She began to wish that she had never left Callisto, that she had  cancelled her passage on the Kismet when she learned that Carlton  was to be a fellow passenger. But her studio had wired her to return  to Earth immediately to make a new series of three dimensional video  films. And the Kismet was the only first class space ship flying to  Earth for two weeks. So she had kept her ticket in spite of Carlton.\n\n\n \"I must say that I think Miss Toujours has the prettiest mouth I've  ever seen,\" boomed Captain Fogarty, his voice sounding something like  a cross between a foghorn and a steam whistle. And he was not merely  being gallant, for many a lonely night as he flew the darkness between  Earth and the many planets, he had dreamed of caressing those lips.\n\n\n \"And I think you are definitely a man of discriminating taste,\" said  Darling demurely, crossing her legs and arranging her dress to expose a  little more of the Toujours charms to the Captain's eye.\n\n\n Carlton smiled casually at the exposed flesh. \"It's all very pretty,  my dear,\" he said smugly. \"But we've seen it all before and in space  you're supposed to act like a lady, if you can act that well.\"\n\n\n Darling Toujours drew back her hand to smack Carlton one in a very  unlady-like manner when she suddenly realized that they were not alone.  Her hand froze, poised elegantly in mid-air, as she turned to see a  newcomer standing at the door. The witness to the impending slap was a withered little lady, scarcely  five feet tall, with silvered hair, eyes that twinkled like a March  wind, and a friendly rash of wrinkles that gave her face the kindly,  weathered appearance of an old stone idol. Her slight figure was lost  in volumes of black cloth draped on her in a manner that had gone out  of style at least fifty years before. The little woman coughed politely.\n\n\n \"I beg your pardon,\" she told them in a sweet, high little voice.  \"I hope I didn't interrupt anything. If you would like to hit the  gentleman, Miss Toujours, I'll be glad to come back later.\"\n\n\n Darling Toujours opened her violet eyes wide in surprise. \"Why, I  was ... I was ... I\u2014\" The actress uttered a small, gulping sound as  she recovered her poise. \"Why, I was just going to pat him on the cheek  for being such a nice boy. You are a nice boy, aren't you, Carlton?\"  She leaned forward to stroke him gently on the face. Carlton roared  with laughter and the good Captain colored deeply.\n\n\n \"Oh,\" said the little old woman, \"I'm sorry. I didn't know that he was  your son.\" Carlton choked suddenly and Darling suffered from a brief  fit of hysteria.\n\n\n The Captain took command. \"Now, look here, Madam,\" he sputtered. \"What  is it you want?\"\n\n\n \"I really wanted to see you, Captain,\" she told him, her battered old  shoes bringing her fully into the room with little mincing steps. \"The  Purser says I have to sign a contract of some kind with you, and I  wanted to know how to write my name. I'm Mrs. Omar K. Perkins, but you  see, I'm really Mrs. Matilda Perkins because my Omar died a few years  ago. But I haven't signed my name very much since then and I'm not at  all sure of which is legal.\" She put one bird-like little hand to  her throat and clasped the cameo there almost as if it could give her  support. She looked so small and so frail that Fogarty forgave her the  intrusion.\n\n\n \"It really doesn't make much difference how you sign the thing, just so  long as you sign it,\" he blustered. \"Just a mere formality anyway. You  just sign it any way you like.\" He paused, hoping that she would leave  now that she had her information.\n\n\n \"Oh, I'm so glad to hear that,\" she said, but made no move whatsoever  to leave. Captain Fogarty gave her his hardened stare of the type which  withered most people where they stood. Mrs. Perkins just smiled sweetly  at him.\n\n\n His rage getting out of hand, he finally blurted, \"And now, Mrs.  Perkins, I think you'd better be getting back to your quarters. As you  know, this is a private lounge for the first class passengers.\"\n\n\n Mrs. Perkins continued to smile at him. \"Yes, I know. It's lovely,  isn't it? I'll just go out this way.\" And before anyone could stop her,  she had moved to the door to Darling Toujours' suite and had opened it,  stepping inside.\n\n\n \"That's my room, not the door out,\" Darling said loudly.\n\n\n \"So I see,\" said Mrs. Perkins, staring at the opulent furnishings  with avid pleasure. \"It's such a pretty thing, all done up with  mother-of-pearl like that, isn't it? And what a pretty lace nightie  lying on the bed.\" Mrs. Perkins picked up the sheer, gossamer garment  to examine it. \"You do wear something under it, don't you?\"\n\n\n Darling screeched and darted for the door. She snatched the nightie  away from Mrs. Perkins and rudely propelled the older woman out the  door, closing it behind her. \"Captain, this woman must GO!\"\n\n\n \"I was just leaving, Miss Toujours. I hope you and your son have a very  happy voyage. Good day, Captain Fogarty,\" she called over her shoulder  as she exited. Carlton E. Carlton's shrill laughter followed her down  the companionway. Mrs. Perkins had been lying in her berth reading for less than an hour  when the knock sounded at her door. She would have preferred to sit up  and read, but her cabin was so small that there was no room for any  other furniture besides the bed.\n\n\n \"Come in,\" she called in a small voice.\n\n\n Johnny Weaver, steward for the cheaper cabins, poked his youthful,  freckled face through the door. \"Howdy, Mrs. Perkins. I wondered if I  could do anything for you? It's about ten minutes before we eat.\"\n\n\n \"Well, you can pull that big box down from the top shelf there, if you  don't mind. And, I wonder, would you mind calling me Grandma? All my  children do it and I miss it so.\" She gave him a wrinkled smile that  was at once wistful and petulant.\n\n\n Johnny laughed in an easy, infectious manner. \"Sure thing, Grandma.\"  He stretched his long arms up to bring down the heavy bag and found  himself wondering just how it had gotten up there in the first place.  He didn't remember ever putting it there for her and Grandma Perkins  was obviously too frail a woman to have handled such a heavy box by  herself. He put it on the floor.\n\n\n As she stooped over and extracted a pair of low-heeled, black and  battered shoes from the box, she asked him, \"Johnny, what was that  paper I signed this afternoon?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, that? Why that was just a contract for passage, Grandma. You  guaranteed to pay them so much for the flight, which you've already  done, and they guaranteed that you wouldn't be put off against your  will until you reached your destination.\"\n\n\n \"But why do we have to have a contract?\"\n\n\n Johnny leaned back, relaxing against the door. \"Well, STAR\u2014that's  Stellar Transportation and Atomic Research, you know\u2014is one of  the thirteen monopolies in this part of the solar system. The \"Big  Thirteen,\" we call them. STAR charters every space flight in this neck  of the woods. Well, back in the old days, when space flights were  scarce, it used to be that you'd pay for a ticket from Saturn to Earth,  say, and you'd get to Mars and they'd stop for fuel. Maybe somebody  on Mars would offer a lot of money for your cabin. So STAR would just  bump you off, refund part of your money and leave you stranded there.  In order to get the monopoly, they had to promise to stop all that. And  the Solar Congress makes them sign contracts guaranteeing you that they  won't put you off against your wishes. Of course, they don't dare do it  anymore anyway, but that's the law.\"\n\n\n Grandma Perkins sighed. \"It's such a small cabin I don't think anybody  else would want it. But it's all that I could afford,\" she said,  smoothing out the wrinkles in her dress with both hands.\n\n\n \"Anything else I can do for you, Grandma?\"\n\n\n \"No, thank you, Johnny. I think I can make it up the steps to the  dining room by myself.\"\n\n\n A little while later when Johnny looked into her room to see if she had  gone, the cabin was empty and the heavy box was back in place in the  top cabinet. The food that evening was not the very best, Grandma Perkins thought to  herself, but that was mostly due to her seat. By the time the waiter  got around to her little cranny most of it was cold. But she didn't  complain. She enjoyed watching the people with the more expensive  cabins parade their clothes and their manners at the Captain's table.  And, it must be admitted, she was more than a trifle envious of them.  Her acquaintances of the afternoon, Miss Toujours and Mr. Carlton, were  seated there, Miss Toujours having the place of honor to the Captain's  right.\n\n\n Grandma watched them as they finished up their food and then she moved  from her little table over to one of the very comfortable sofas in the  main lounge. In reality she wasn't supposed to be sitting there, but  she hoped that she could get away with it. The divans were so much more  comfortable than her hard, narrow bed that she felt like sitting there  for a long time, by herself, just thinking.\n\n\n But her hopes met with disappointment. For shortly after she sat down,  Darling Toujours and Carlton E. Carlton strolled over and sat down  across from her, not recognizing her at first. Then Carlton spied her.\n\n\n \"Darling! There's that priceless little woman we met this afternoon.\"\n\n\n \"The little hag, you mean,\" Miss Toujours muttered under her breath,  but loudly enough for Grandma Perkins to hear.\n\n\n \"Why, hello, Miss Toujours. And Mr. Carlton too. I hope you'll forgive  me for this afternoon. I've found out who you were, you see.\"\n\n\n \"Of course we forgive you, Mrs. Jerkins,\" Darling said throatily,  baring her teeth like a feline.\n\n\n \"My name is Perkins,\" Grandma smiled.\n\n\n \"I hope you don't mind, Toujours, but you know, you remind me a great  deal of my grandniece, Agatha. She was undoubtedly the most lovely  child I've ever seen.\"\n\n\n \"Why, thank you, Mrs. Perkins,\" Darling purred, starting to preen just  a bit. Anything could be forgiven someone who complimented her.\n\n\n \"Of course, Agatha never was quite bright,\" Grandma said as she turned  her head aside as if in sorrow. \"They were all set to put her in an  institution when she ran off and married the lizard man in a carnival.  I believe she's still appearing in the show as the bearded lady. A  pity. She was so pretty, just like you.\"\n\n\n Darling Toujours muttered a few choice words under her breath.\n\n\n \"But we must all make the best of things as they come. That's what  Omar, my husband, used to say.\" Grandma paused to wipe away a small  tear that had gotten lodged in one of her eyes. \"That reminds me,\" she  said finally, \"I've got a three dimensional picture of Omar right here.  And pictures of all my children, my ten lovely children. I brought them  with me specially tonight because I thought you might want to look at  them. Now, where did I put them?\" Grandma opened her purse and began  rummaging around in its voluminous confines.\n\n\n Darling and Carlton exchanged horrified glances and then rose silently  and tip-toed out of the lounge.\n\n\n Grandma looked up from her search. \"Oh, my, they seem to have gone.\"\n\n\n Johnny Weaver, who had been clearing one of the nearby tables, put down  a stack of dirty dishes and came over to her. \"I'd like to see the  pictures, Grandma.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, that's very nice of you, Johnny, but\u2014\" she said quickly.\n\n\n \"Really I would, Grandma. Where are they?\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014\" She stopped and the devilment showed in her eyes. Her withered  little face pursed itself into a smile. \"There aren't any pictures,  Johnny. I don't carry any. I know their faces all so well I don't have  to. But any time I want to get rid of somebody I just offer to show  them pictures of my family. You'd be surprised how effective it is.\"\n\n\n Johnny laughed. \"Why are you going to Earth, anyway, Grandma?\"\n\n\n The old woman sighed. \"It's a long story, Johnny, but you just sit down  and I'll tell it to you.\"\n\n\n \"I can't sit down in the lounge, but I'll be glad to stand up and  listen.\"\n\n\n \"Then I'll make it a short story. You see, Johnny, I'm an old woman.  I'll be 152 this year. And ever since Omar, my husband, died a few  years ago, I've lived from pillar to post. First with one child and  then with another. They've all been married for decades now of course,  with children and grandchildren of their own. And I guess that I just  get in their way. There just isn't much left in life for a feeble old  woman like me.\" She sniffled a moment or two as if to cry. Johnny,  remembering the heavy box in her cabin that got moved up and down  without his help, suppressed a smile on the word \"feeble.\"\n\n\n \"There aren't many friends my age left around any more. So I'm being  sent to Earth to a home full of dear, sweet old ladies my age, the  money for which is being provided by my dear, sweet children\u2014all ten  of them.\" Grandma dabbed a bit of a handkerchief at her eyes. \"The  rats,\" she muttered under her breath. When she saw her companion was  smiling she dropped her pretense of crying.\n\n\n \"To be truthful, Johnny, they've grown old and stodgy, all of them.  And I'm sure they think I've lost most of my marbles. Everything I did  embarrassed them, so I guess it's for the best, but\u2014\"\n\n\n Grandma Perkins never finished the sentence, for interrupting her came  the horrendous clang of the Kismet's general alarm, and on its heels,  charging through the main salon like a rhinoceros in heat, came Captain  Fogarty.\n\n\n \"PIRATES! PIRATES! We're being attacked by space pirates! You there!\"  he shouted at Johnny. \"Man your station! And you, Madam, to your  quarters at once! PIRATES!\" he shouted again and barged through the  door again and bellowed down the hall to the main bridge.\n\n\n Johnny was off like a startled rabbit, but Grandma moved with serene  calmness to the door. Maybe, she thought, we're going to have a little  excitement after all.\n\n\n At the door to the steps leading to her downstairs cabin she paused to  think.\n\n\n \"If I go down and hide, I'll miss all the fun. Of course, it's safer,  and an old woman like me shouldn't be up and about when pirates are  around, but\u2014\" A delicious smile spread over her face as she took her  scruples firmly in hand and turned to follow the bellowing Captain  towards the bridge. II\n\n\n The Starship Kismet was the pride and joy of Stellar Transportation  and Atomic Research. It was outfitted with every known safety device  and the control room was masterfully planned for maximum efficiency.  But the astral architect who designed her never anticipated the  situation facing her at the present. The Kismet's bridge was a welter  of confusion.\n\n\n The Senior Watch Officer was shouting at his assistant, the Navigator  was cursing out the Pilot and the Gunnery Officer, whose job had been  a sinecure until now, was bellowing at them all. Above the hubbub,  suddenly, came the raucous voice of Captain Fogarty as he stalked onto  the bridge.\n\n\n \"What in great space has happened to the motors? Why are we losing  speed?\"\n\n\n The Senior Watch Officer saluted and shouted, \"Engine Room reports the  engines have all stopped, Sir. Don't know why. We're operating the  lights and vents on emergency power.\"\n\n\n The Communications Officer spoke up. \"The pirate ship reports that  they're responsible, Sir. They say they've got a new device that will  leave us without atomic power for as long as they like.\"\n\n\n As if to confirm this, over the loudspeaker came a voice. \"Ahoy, STAR Kismet . Stand by for boarders. If you don't open up to us, we'll  blast you off the map.\"\n\n\n \"Pirates! Attacking us! Incredible!\" cried the Captain. \"There are no  pirates any more. What have we got a Space Patrol for? Where in blazes  is the Space Patrol anyway?\"\n\n\n The Communications Officer gulped. \"Er, ah, we got in contact with  Commodore Trumble. He says his ship can get here in ten hours anyway,  and for us to wait for him.\"\n\n\n Captain Fogarty snorted. \"Fat lot of good he'll do us. Wait for him,  eh? Well, we'll just blow that pirate out of the sky right now. Stand  by the guns!\"\n\n\n \"The guns are useless,\" whined the Gunnery Officer. \"The atomics that  run them won't operate at all. What will we do?\"\n\n\n \"Ahoy, STAR Kismet . Open up your hatches when we arrive and let us  in, or we won't spare a man of you,\" boomed the loudspeaker.\n\n\n \"Pirates going to board us. How nice,\" muttered Grandma to herself as  she eavesdropped just outside the door to the bridge.\n\n\n \"They'll never get through the hatches alive. At least our small arms  still work. We'll kill 'em all!\" cried Captain Fogarty.\n\n\n \"We only want one of you. All the rest of you will be spared if you  open up the hatches and don't try to make no trouble,\" came the voice  over the radio.\n\n\n \"Tell them I'd rather all of us be killed than to let one dirty pirate  on board my ship,\" the Captain shouted to the Communications Officer.\n\n\n \"Oh, my goodness. That doesn't sound very smart,\" Grandma said half  aloud. And turning from the doorway, she crept back through the  deserted passageway.\n\n\n The main passenger hatch was not too far from the bridge. Grandma found  it with ease, and in less than three minutes she had zipped herself  into one of the emergency-use space suits stowed away beside the port.  She felt awfully awkward climbing into the monstrous steel and plastic  contraption, and her small body didn't quite fit the proportions of the  metallic covering. But once she had maneuvered herself into it, she  felt quite at ease.\n\n\n Opening the inner door to the airlock, she clanked into the little  room. As the door shut behind her, she pressed the cycling button and  evacuated the air from the lock.\n\n\n A minute or so later she heard poundings outside the airlock and quite  calmly she reached out a mailed fist and turned a switch plainly  marked: EMERGENCY LOCK\n\n DO NOT OPERATE IN FLIGHT\n\n\n The outer hatch opened almost immediately. The radio in Grandma's suit  crackled with static. \"What are you doing here?\" demanded a voice over  the suit radio.\n\n\n \"Pirates! I'm hiding from the pirates. They'll never find me here!\" she  told them in a voice she hoped sounded full of panic.\n\n\n \"What's your name?\" asked the voice.\n\n\n \"Darling Toujours, famous television actress,\" she lied quite calmly.\n\n\n \"That's the one, boys,\" said another voice. \"Let's go.\" Catching hold  of Grandma's arm, they led her out into the emptiness of free space. Half an hour later, after the pirate ship had blasted far enough away  from the Kismet , the men in the control room relaxed and began to  take off their space suits. One of the men who Grandma soon learned was  Lamps O'Toole, the nominal leader of the pirates, stretched his brawny  body to ease the crinks out of it and then rubbed his hands together.  Grandma noticed that he carried a week's beard on his face, as did most  of the other men.\n\n\n \"Well, that was a good one, eh, Snake?\" said Lamps.\n\n\n Snake Simpson was a wiry little man whose tough exterior in no way  suggested a reptile, except, perhaps, for his eyes which sat too close  to one another. \"You bet, Skipper. We're full fledged pirates now, just  like old Captain Blackbrood.\"\n\n\n \"You mean Blackbeard, Snake,\" said Lamps.\n\n\n \"Sure. He used to sit around broodin' up trouble all the time.\"\n\n\n One of the other men piped up. \"And to think we get the pleasurable  company of the sweetest doll in the whole solar system for free besides  the money.\"\n\n\n \"Aw, women are no dern good\u2014all of them,\" said Snake.\n\n\n \"Now, Snake, that's no way to talk in front of company. You just  apologize to the lady,\" Lamps told him. Lamps was six inches taller and  fifty pounds heavier than Snake. Snake apologized.\n\n\n \"That's better. And now, Miss Toujours, maybe you'd be more  comfortable without that space suit on,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Oh, no, thank you. I feel much better with it on,\" a small voice said  over the suit's loudspeaker system.\n\n\n Lamps grinned. \"Oh, come now, Miss Toujours. We ain't going to hurt  you. I guarantee nobody will lay a finger to you.\"\n\n\n \"But I feel much\u2014much safer, if you know what I mean,\" said the voice.\n\n\n \"Heck. With one of them things on, you can't eat, can't sleep,  can't\u2014Well, there's lots of things you can't do with one of them  things on. Besides, we all want to take a little look at you, if you  don't mind. Snake, you and Willie help the little lady out of her  attire.\"\n\n\n As the men approached her, Grandma sensed the game was up. \"Okay,\" she  told them. \"I give up. I can make it by myself.\" She started to take  the bulky covering off. She had gotten no more than the headpiece off  when the truth dawned on her companions.\n\n\n \"Holy Smoke (or something like that),\" said one of the men.\n\n\n \"Nippin' Nebulae,\" said another.\n\n\n \"It ain't Darling Toujours at all!\" cried Lamps.\n\n\n \"It ain't even no woman!\" cried Snake.\n\n\n \"I beg your pardon,\" said Grandma, and quite nonchalantly shed the rest  of the suit and sat down in a comfortable chair. \"I am Mrs. Matilda  Perkins.\"\n\n\n When he could recover his powers of speech, Lamps sputtered, \"I think  you owe us a sort of an explanation, lady. If you know what I mean.\"\n\n\n \"Certainly. I know exactly what you mean. It's all quite simple. When I  overheard that you intended to board the Kismet , searching for only  one person, I decided that one person had to be Darling Toujours. I  guessed right off that she was the only one on board worth kidnapping  and holding for ransom, so I simply let you believe that I was she and  you took me. That's easy to understand, isn't it?\"\n\n\n \"Lady, I don't know what your game is, but it better be good. Now, just  why did you do this to us?\" Lamps was restraining himself nobly.\n\n\n \"You never would have gotten inside the Kismet without my assistance.  And even if you had, you'd never have gotten back out alive.\n\n\n \"Captain Fogarty's men would have cut you to ribbons. So I opened the  hatch to let you in, planted myself in the way, and you got out with  me before they could muster their defenses. So, you see, I saved your  lives.\"\n\n\n Grandma Perkins paused in her narrative and looked up at her audience,  giving them a withered little smile. \"And if you want to know why,  well ... I was bored on the Kismet , and I thought how nice it would  be to run away and join a gang of cutthroat pirates.\"\n\n\n \"She's batty,\" moaned Snake.\n\n\n \"She's lost her marbles,\" muttered another.\n\n\n \"Let's toss her overboard right now,\" said still another.\n\n\n Lamps O'Toole took the floor. \"Now, wait a minute. We can't do that,\"  he said loudly. \"We got enough trouble as is. You know what would  happen to us if the Space Patrol added murder to the list. They'd put  the whole fleet in after us and track us and our families down to the  last kid.\" Then he turned to the little old lady to explain.\n\n\n \"Look, lady\u2014\"\n\n\n \"My name is Mrs. Matilda Perkins. You may call me Grandma.\"\n\n\n \"Okay, Grandma, look. You really fixed us good. To begin with, we ain't  really pirates. We used to operate this tub as a freighter between the  Jupiter moons. But STAR got a monopoly on all space flights, including  freight, and they just froze us out. We can't operate nowhere in the  solar system, unless we get their permission. And they just ain't  giving permission to nobody these days.\" Lamps flopped into one of the  control seats and lit a cigarette.\n\n\n \"So, when us good, honest men couldn't find any work because of STAR,  and we didn't want to give up working in space, we just ups and decides  to become pirates. This was our first job, and we sure did need the  money we could have gotten out of Darling Toujours' studios for ransom.\"\n\n\n Lamps sighed. \"Now, we got you instead, no chance of getting the ransom  money, and to top it all off, we'll be wanted for piracy by the Space  Patrol.\"\n\n\n \"Well, it doesn't seem to me that you're ever going to be good pirates  at this rate,\" Grandma told him. \"You should have known better than to  take a woman at her word.\"\n\n\n \"I don't suppose you got any rich relatives what would pay to get you  back?\" suggested Snake hopefully.\n\n\n \"I haven't got any rich relatives period,\" she said pertly. Then she  added, \"But my ten children might scrape up a little cash for you if  you promised you wouldn't bring me back at all.\"\n\n\n \"I figured as much,\" Lamps said dolefully. \"Lookit, Grandma, the best  thing we can do is to put you off safely at the next place we stop.  Unless we get you back in one piece the Space Patrol will be on our  necks forever. So don't go getting any ideas about joining up with us.\"\n\n\n \"Well, the very least you could do for a poor old lady is to feed her,\"  Grandma told him, her lower lip sticking out in a most petulant manner.  \"They like to have starved me to death on that Kismet .\"\n\n\n \"We ain't got much fancy in the line of grub....\" Lamps began.\n\n\n \"Just show me the way to the kitchen,\" said Grandma.

But it took sweet old   Grandma Perkins, of the pirate ship Dirty\n\n Shame, to set the Jupiter moons on fire .\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories March 1954.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] \"I can always get along with a man if he remembers who he is,\" said  Darling Toujours, the raven-haired, creamy-skinned televideo actress  whose smoke-and-flame eyes lit fires in hearts all over the solar  system. She was credited with being the most beautiful woman alive and  there were few who dared to contradict her when she mentioned it.\n\n\n \"And I can always get along with a woman if she remembers who I am,\"  replied Carlton E. Carlton, the acid-tongued author whose biting novels  had won him universal fame. He leaned his thin, bony body back into the  comfort of an overstuffed chair and favored the actress with a wicked  smile.\n\n\n The two of them were sitting in the finest lounge of the luxury space  ship Kismet , enjoying postprandial cocktails with Captain Homer  Fogarty, the Kismet's rotund commanding officer. The Kismet was  blasting through space at close to the speed of light, bound from  Callisto, one of Jupiter's moons, back to Earth. But none of the two  hundred Earthbound passengers were conscious of the speed at all.\n\n\n Darling Toujours waved a long cigarette holder at the author. \"Don't  pay any attention to him, Captain. You know how writers are\u2014always  putting words in other people's mouths, and not very good ones at that.\"\n\n\n \"Do you mean not very good words or not very good mouths, my dear?\"  Carlton asked. The solar system's most famous actress clamped her  scarlet lips shut with rage. It would take someone like Carlton E.  Carlton, she knew, to point out the one minor blemish in an otherwise  perfect body\u2014her slightly over-sized mouth.\n\n\n She began to wish that she had never left Callisto, that she had  cancelled her passage on the Kismet when she learned that Carlton  was to be a fellow passenger. But her studio had wired her to return  to Earth immediately to make a new series of three dimensional video  films. And the Kismet was the only first class space ship flying to  Earth for two weeks. So she had kept her ticket in spite of Carlton.\n\n\n \"I must say that I think Miss Toujours has the prettiest mouth I've  ever seen,\" boomed Captain Fogarty, his voice sounding something like  a cross between a foghorn and a steam whistle. And he was not merely  being gallant, for many a lonely night as he flew the darkness between  Earth and the many planets, he had dreamed of caressing those lips.\n\n\n \"And I think you are definitely a man of discriminating taste,\" said  Darling demurely, crossing her legs and arranging her dress to expose a  little more of the Toujours charms to the Captain's eye.\n\n\n Carlton smiled casually at the exposed flesh. \"It's all very pretty,  my dear,\" he said smugly. \"But we've seen it all before and in space  you're supposed to act like a lady, if you can act that well.\"\n\n\n Darling Toujours drew back her hand to smack Carlton one in a very  unlady-like manner when she suddenly realized that they were not alone.  Her hand froze, poised elegantly in mid-air, as she turned to see a  newcomer standing at the door. The witness to the impending slap was a withered little lady, scarcely  five feet tall, with silvered hair, eyes that twinkled like a March  wind, and a friendly rash of wrinkles that gave her face the kindly,  weathered appearance of an old stone idol. Her slight figure was lost  in volumes of black cloth draped on her in a manner that had gone out  of style at least fifty years before. The little woman coughed politely.\n\n\n \"I beg your pardon,\" she told them in a sweet, high little voice.  \"I hope I didn't interrupt anything. If you would like to hit the  gentleman, Miss Toujours, I'll be glad to come back later.\"\n\n\n Darling Toujours opened her violet eyes wide in surprise. \"Why, I  was ... I was ... I\u2014\" The actress uttered a small, gulping sound as  she recovered her poise. \"Why, I was just going to pat him on the cheek  for being such a nice boy. You are a nice boy, aren't you, Carlton?\"  She leaned forward to stroke him gently on the face. Carlton roared  with laughter and the good Captain colored deeply.\n\n\n \"Oh,\" said the little old woman, \"I'm sorry. I didn't know that he was  your son.\" Carlton choked suddenly and Darling suffered from a brief  fit of hysteria.\n\n\n The Captain took command. \"Now, look here, Madam,\" he sputtered. \"What  is it you want?\"\n\n\n \"I really wanted to see you, Captain,\" she told him, her battered old  shoes bringing her fully into the room with little mincing steps. \"The  Purser says I have to sign a contract of some kind with you, and I  wanted to know how to write my name. I'm Mrs. Omar K. Perkins, but you  see, I'm really Mrs. Matilda Perkins because my Omar died a few years  ago. But I haven't signed my name very much since then and I'm not at  all sure of which is legal.\" She put one bird-like little hand to  her throat and clasped the cameo there almost as if it could give her  support. She looked so small and so frail that Fogarty forgave her the  intrusion.\n\n\n \"It really doesn't make much difference how you sign the thing, just so  long as you sign it,\" he blustered. \"Just a mere formality anyway. You  just sign it any way you like.\" He paused, hoping that she would leave  now that she had her information.\n\n\n \"Oh, I'm so glad to hear that,\" she said, but made no move whatsoever  to leave. Captain Fogarty gave her his hardened stare of the type which  withered most people where they stood. Mrs. Perkins just smiled sweetly  at him.\n\n\n His rage getting out of hand, he finally blurted, \"And now, Mrs.  Perkins, I think you'd better be getting back to your quarters. As you  know, this is a private lounge for the first class passengers.\"\n\n\n Mrs. Perkins continued to smile at him. \"Yes, I know. It's lovely,  isn't it? I'll just go out this way.\" And before anyone could stop her,  she had moved to the door to Darling Toujours' suite and had opened it,  stepping inside.\n\n\n \"That's my room, not the door out,\" Darling said loudly.\n\n\n \"So I see,\" said Mrs. Perkins, staring at the opulent furnishings  with avid pleasure. \"It's such a pretty thing, all done up with  mother-of-pearl like that, isn't it? And what a pretty lace nightie  lying on the bed.\" Mrs. Perkins picked up the sheer, gossamer garment  to examine it. \"You do wear something under it, don't you?\"\n\n\n Darling screeched and darted for the door. She snatched the nightie  away from Mrs. Perkins and rudely propelled the older woman out the  door, closing it behind her. \"Captain, this woman must GO!\"\n\n\n \"I was just leaving, Miss Toujours. I hope you and your son have a very  happy voyage. Good day, Captain Fogarty,\" she called over her shoulder  as she exited. Carlton E. Carlton's shrill laughter followed her down  the companionway. Mrs. Perkins had been lying in her berth reading for less than an hour  when the knock sounded at her door. She would have preferred to sit up  and read, but her cabin was so small that there was no room for any  other furniture besides the bed.\n\n\n \"Come in,\" she called in a small voice.\n\n\n Johnny Weaver, steward for the cheaper cabins, poked his youthful,  freckled face through the door. \"Howdy, Mrs. Perkins. I wondered if I  could do anything for you? It's about ten minutes before we eat.\"\n\n\n \"Well, you can pull that big box down from the top shelf there, if you  don't mind. And, I wonder, would you mind calling me Grandma? All my  children do it and I miss it so.\" She gave him a wrinkled smile that  was at once wistful and petulant.\n\n\n Johnny laughed in an easy, infectious manner. \"Sure thing, Grandma.\"  He stretched his long arms up to bring down the heavy bag and found  himself wondering just how it had gotten up there in the first place.  He didn't remember ever putting it there for her and Grandma Perkins  was obviously too frail a woman to have handled such a heavy box by  herself. He put it on the floor.\n\n\n As she stooped over and extracted a pair of low-heeled, black and  battered shoes from the box, she asked him, \"Johnny, what was that  paper I signed this afternoon?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, that? Why that was just a contract for passage, Grandma. You  guaranteed to pay them so much for the flight, which you've already  done, and they guaranteed that you wouldn't be put off against your  will until you reached your destination.\"\n\n\n \"But why do we have to have a contract?\"\n\n\n Johnny leaned back, relaxing against the door. \"Well, STAR\u2014that's  Stellar Transportation and Atomic Research, you know\u2014is one of  the thirteen monopolies in this part of the solar system. The \"Big  Thirteen,\" we call them. STAR charters every space flight in this neck  of the woods. Well, back in the old days, when space flights were  scarce, it used to be that you'd pay for a ticket from Saturn to Earth,  say, and you'd get to Mars and they'd stop for fuel. Maybe somebody  on Mars would offer a lot of money for your cabin. So STAR would just  bump you off, refund part of your money and leave you stranded there.  In order to get the monopoly, they had to promise to stop all that. And  the Solar Congress makes them sign contracts guaranteeing you that they  won't put you off against your wishes. Of course, they don't dare do it  anymore anyway, but that's the law.\"\n\n\n Grandma Perkins sighed. \"It's such a small cabin I don't think anybody  else would want it. But it's all that I could afford,\" she said,  smoothing out the wrinkles in her dress with both hands.\n\n\n \"Anything else I can do for you, Grandma?\"\n\n\n \"No, thank you, Johnny. I think I can make it up the steps to the  dining room by myself.\"\n\n\n A little while later when Johnny looked into her room to see if she had  gone, the cabin was empty and the heavy box was back in place in the  top cabinet. The food that evening was not the very best, Grandma Perkins thought to  herself, but that was mostly due to her seat. By the time the waiter  got around to her little cranny most of it was cold. But she didn't  complain. She enjoyed watching the people with the more expensive  cabins parade their clothes and their manners at the Captain's table.  And, it must be admitted, she was more than a trifle envious of them.  Her acquaintances of the afternoon, Miss Toujours and Mr. Carlton, were  seated there, Miss Toujours having the place of honor to the Captain's  right.\n\n\n Grandma watched them as they finished up their food and then she moved  from her little table over to one of the very comfortable sofas in the  main lounge. In reality she wasn't supposed to be sitting there, but  she hoped that she could get away with it. The divans were so much more  comfortable than her hard, narrow bed that she felt like sitting there  for a long time, by herself, just thinking.\n\n\n But her hopes met with disappointment. For shortly after she sat down,  Darling Toujours and Carlton E. Carlton strolled over and sat down  across from her, not recognizing her at first. Then Carlton spied her.\n\n\n \"Darling! There's that priceless little woman we met this afternoon.\"\n\n\n \"The little hag, you mean,\" Miss Toujours muttered under her breath,  but loudly enough for Grandma Perkins to hear.\n\n\n \"Why, hello, Miss Toujours. And Mr. Carlton too. I hope you'll forgive  me for this afternoon. I've found out who you were, you see.\"\n\n\n \"Of course we forgive you, Mrs. Jerkins,\" Darling said throatily,  baring her teeth like a feline.\n\n\n \"My name is Perkins,\" Grandma smiled.\n\n\n \"I hope you don't mind, Toujours, but you know, you remind me a great  deal of my grandniece, Agatha. She was undoubtedly the most lovely  child I've ever seen.\"\n\n\n \"Why, thank you, Mrs. Perkins,\" Darling purred, starting to preen just  a bit. Anything could be forgiven someone who complimented her.\n\n\n \"Of course, Agatha never was quite bright,\" Grandma said as she turned  her head aside as if in sorrow. \"They were all set to put her in an  institution when she ran off and married the lizard man in a carnival.  I believe she's still appearing in the show as the bearded lady. A  pity. She was so pretty, just like you.\"\n\n\n Darling Toujours muttered a few choice words under her breath.\n\n\n \"But we must all make the best of things as they come. That's what  Omar, my husband, used to say.\" Grandma paused to wipe away a small  tear that had gotten lodged in one of her eyes. \"That reminds me,\" she  said finally, \"I've got a three dimensional picture of Omar right here.  And pictures of all my children, my ten lovely children. I brought them  with me specially tonight because I thought you might want to look at  them. Now, where did I put them?\" Grandma opened her purse and began  rummaging around in its voluminous confines.\n\n\n Darling and Carlton exchanged horrified glances and then rose silently  and tip-toed out of the lounge.\n\n\n Grandma looked up from her search. \"Oh, my, they seem to have gone.\"\n\n\n Johnny Weaver, who had been clearing one of the nearby tables, put down  a stack of dirty dishes and came over to her. \"I'd like to see the  pictures, Grandma.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, that's very nice of you, Johnny, but\u2014\" she said quickly.\n\n\n \"Really I would, Grandma. Where are they?\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014\" She stopped and the devilment showed in her eyes. Her withered  little face pursed itself into a smile. \"There aren't any pictures,  Johnny. I don't carry any. I know their faces all so well I don't have  to. But any time I want to get rid of somebody I just offer to show  them pictures of my family. You'd be surprised how effective it is.\"\n\n\n Johnny laughed. \"Why are you going to Earth, anyway, Grandma?\"\n\n\n The old woman sighed. \"It's a long story, Johnny, but you just sit down  and I'll tell it to you.\"\n\n\n \"I can't sit down in the lounge, but I'll be glad to stand up and  listen.\"\n\n\n \"Then I'll make it a short story. You see, Johnny, I'm an old woman.  I'll be 152 this year. And ever since Omar, my husband, died a few  years ago, I've lived from pillar to post. First with one child and  then with another. They've all been married for decades now of course,  with children and grandchildren of their own. And I guess that I just  get in their way. There just isn't much left in life for a feeble old  woman like me.\" She sniffled a moment or two as if to cry. Johnny,  remembering the heavy box in her cabin that got moved up and down  without his help, suppressed a smile on the word \"feeble.\"\n\n\n \"There aren't many friends my age left around any more. So I'm being  sent to Earth to a home full of dear, sweet old ladies my age, the  money for which is being provided by my dear, sweet children\u2014all ten  of them.\" Grandma dabbed a bit of a handkerchief at her eyes. \"The  rats,\" she muttered under her breath. When she saw her companion was  smiling she dropped her pretense of crying.\n\n\n \"To be truthful, Johnny, they've grown old and stodgy, all of them.  And I'm sure they think I've lost most of my marbles. Everything I did  embarrassed them, so I guess it's for the best, but\u2014\"\n\n\n Grandma Perkins never finished the sentence, for interrupting her came  the horrendous clang of the Kismet's general alarm, and on its heels,  charging through the main salon like a rhinoceros in heat, came Captain  Fogarty.\n\n\n \"PIRATES! PIRATES! We're being attacked by space pirates! You there!\"  he shouted at Johnny. \"Man your station! And you, Madam, to your  quarters at once! PIRATES!\" he shouted again and barged through the  door again and bellowed down the hall to the main bridge.\n\n\n Johnny was off like a startled rabbit, but Grandma moved with serene  calmness to the door. Maybe, she thought, we're going to have a little  excitement after all.\n\n\n At the door to the steps leading to her downstairs cabin she paused to  think.\n\n\n \"If I go down and hide, I'll miss all the fun. Of course, it's safer,  and an old woman like me shouldn't be up and about when pirates are  around, but\u2014\" A delicious smile spread over her face as she took her  scruples firmly in hand and turned to follow the bellowing Captain  towards the bridge. II\n\n\n The Starship Kismet was the pride and joy of Stellar Transportation  and Atomic Research. It was outfitted with every known safety device  and the control room was masterfully planned for maximum efficiency.  But the astral architect who designed her never anticipated the  situation facing her at the present. The Kismet's bridge was a welter  of confusion.\n\n\n The Senior Watch Officer was shouting at his assistant, the Navigator  was cursing out the Pilot and the Gunnery Officer, whose job had been  a sinecure until now, was bellowing at them all. Above the hubbub,  suddenly, came the raucous voice of Captain Fogarty as he stalked onto  the bridge.\n\n\n \"What in great space has happened to the motors? Why are we losing  speed?\"\n\n\n The Senior Watch Officer saluted and shouted, \"Engine Room reports the  engines have all stopped, Sir. Don't know why. We're operating the  lights and vents on emergency power.\"\n\n\n The Communications Officer spoke up. \"The pirate ship reports that  they're responsible, Sir. They say they've got a new device that will  leave us without atomic power for as long as they like.\"\n\n\n As if to confirm this, over the loudspeaker came a voice. \"Ahoy, STAR Kismet . Stand by for boarders. If you don't open up to us, we'll  blast you off the map.\"\n\n\n \"Pirates! Attacking us! Incredible!\" cried the Captain. \"There are no  pirates any more. What have we got a Space Patrol for? Where in blazes  is the Space Patrol anyway?\"\n\n\n The Communications Officer gulped. \"Er, ah, we got in contact with  Commodore Trumble. He says his ship can get here in ten hours anyway,  and for us to wait for him.\"\n\n\n Captain Fogarty snorted. \"Fat lot of good he'll do us. Wait for him,  eh? Well, we'll just blow that pirate out of the sky right now. Stand  by the guns!\"\n\n\n \"The guns are useless,\" whined the Gunnery Officer. \"The atomics that  run them won't operate at all. What will we do?\"\n\n\n \"Ahoy, STAR Kismet . Open up your hatches when we arrive and let us  in, or we won't spare a man of you,\" boomed the loudspeaker.\n\n\n \"Pirates going to board us. How nice,\" muttered Grandma to herself as  she eavesdropped just outside the door to the bridge.\n\n\n \"They'll never get through the hatches alive. At least our small arms  still work. We'll kill 'em all!\" cried Captain Fogarty.\n\n\n \"We only want one of you. All the rest of you will be spared if you  open up the hatches and don't try to make no trouble,\" came the voice  over the radio.\n\n\n \"Tell them I'd rather all of us be killed than to let one dirty pirate  on board my ship,\" the Captain shouted to the Communications Officer.\n\n\n \"Oh, my goodness. That doesn't sound very smart,\" Grandma said half  aloud. And turning from the doorway, she crept back through the  deserted passageway.\n\n\n The main passenger hatch was not too far from the bridge. Grandma found  it with ease, and in less than three minutes she had zipped herself  into one of the emergency-use space suits stowed away beside the port.  She felt awfully awkward climbing into the monstrous steel and plastic  contraption, and her small body didn't quite fit the proportions of the  metallic covering. But once she had maneuvered herself into it, she  felt quite at ease.\n\n\n Opening the inner door to the airlock, she clanked into the little  room. As the door shut behind her, she pressed the cycling button and  evacuated the air from the lock.\n\n\n A minute or so later she heard poundings outside the airlock and quite  calmly she reached out a mailed fist and turned a switch plainly  marked: EMERGENCY LOCK\n\n DO NOT OPERATE IN FLIGHT\n\n\n The outer hatch opened almost immediately. The radio in Grandma's suit  crackled with static. \"What are you doing here?\" demanded a voice over  the suit radio.\n\n\n \"Pirates! I'm hiding from the pirates. They'll never find me here!\" she  told them in a voice she hoped sounded full of panic.\n\n\n \"What's your name?\" asked the voice.\n\n\n \"Darling Toujours, famous television actress,\" she lied quite calmly.\n\n\n \"That's the one, boys,\" said another voice. \"Let's go.\" Catching hold  of Grandma's arm, they led her out into the emptiness of free space. Half an hour later, after the pirate ship had blasted far enough away  from the Kismet , the men in the control room relaxed and began to  take off their space suits. One of the men who Grandma soon learned was  Lamps O'Toole, the nominal leader of the pirates, stretched his brawny  body to ease the crinks out of it and then rubbed his hands together.  Grandma noticed that he carried a week's beard on his face, as did most  of the other men.\n\n\n \"Well, that was a good one, eh, Snake?\" said Lamps.\n\n\n Snake Simpson was a wiry little man whose tough exterior in no way  suggested a reptile, except, perhaps, for his eyes which sat too close  to one another. \"You bet, Skipper. We're full fledged pirates now, just  like old Captain Blackbrood.\"\n\n\n \"You mean Blackbeard, Snake,\" said Lamps.\n\n\n \"Sure. He used to sit around broodin' up trouble all the time.\"\n\n\n One of the other men piped up. \"And to think we get the pleasurable  company of the sweetest doll in the whole solar system for free besides  the money.\"\n\n\n \"Aw, women are no dern good\u2014all of them,\" said Snake.\n\n\n \"Now, Snake, that's no way to talk in front of company. You just  apologize to the lady,\" Lamps told him. Lamps was six inches taller and  fifty pounds heavier than Snake. Snake apologized.\n\n\n \"That's better. And now, Miss Toujours, maybe you'd be more  comfortable without that space suit on,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Oh, no, thank you. I feel much better with it on,\" a small voice said  over the suit's loudspeaker system.\n\n\n Lamps grinned. \"Oh, come now, Miss Toujours. We ain't going to hurt  you. I guarantee nobody will lay a finger to you.\"\n\n\n \"But I feel much\u2014much safer, if you know what I mean,\" said the voice.\n\n\n \"Heck. With one of them things on, you can't eat, can't sleep,  can't\u2014Well, there's lots of things you can't do with one of them  things on. Besides, we all want to take a little look at you, if you  don't mind. Snake, you and Willie help the little lady out of her  attire.\"\n\n\n As the men approached her, Grandma sensed the game was up. \"Okay,\" she  told them. \"I give up. I can make it by myself.\" She started to take  the bulky covering off. She had gotten no more than the headpiece off  when the truth dawned on her companions.\n\n\n \"Holy Smoke (or something like that),\" said one of the men.\n\n\n \"Nippin' Nebulae,\" said another.\n\n\n \"It ain't Darling Toujours at all!\" cried Lamps.\n\n\n \"It ain't even no woman!\" cried Snake.\n\n\n \"I beg your pardon,\" said Grandma, and quite nonchalantly shed the rest  of the suit and sat down in a comfortable chair. \"I am Mrs. Matilda  Perkins.\"\n\n\n When he could recover his powers of speech, Lamps sputtered, \"I think  you owe us a sort of an explanation, lady. If you know what I mean.\"\n\n\n \"Certainly. I know exactly what you mean. It's all quite simple. When I  overheard that you intended to board the Kismet , searching for only  one person, I decided that one person had to be Darling Toujours. I  guessed right off that she was the only one on board worth kidnapping  and holding for ransom, so I simply let you believe that I was she and  you took me. That's easy to understand, isn't it?\"\n\n\n \"Lady, I don't know what your game is, but it better be good. Now, just  why did you do this to us?\" Lamps was restraining himself nobly.\n\n\n \"You never would have gotten inside the Kismet without my assistance.  And even if you had, you'd never have gotten back out alive.\n\n\n \"Captain Fogarty's men would have cut you to ribbons. So I opened the  hatch to let you in, planted myself in the way, and you got out with  me before they could muster their defenses. So, you see, I saved your  lives.\"\n\n\n Grandma Perkins paused in her narrative and looked up at her audience,  giving them a withered little smile. \"And if you want to know why,  well ... I was bored on the Kismet , and I thought how nice it would  be to run away and join a gang of cutthroat pirates.\"\n\n\n \"She's batty,\" moaned Snake.\n\n\n \"She's lost her marbles,\" muttered another.\n\n\n \"Let's toss her overboard right now,\" said still another.\n\n\n Lamps O'Toole took the floor. \"Now, wait a minute. We can't do that,\"  he said loudly. \"We got enough trouble as is. You know what would  happen to us if the Space Patrol added murder to the list. They'd put  the whole fleet in after us and track us and our families down to the  last kid.\" Then he turned to the little old lady to explain.\n\n\n \"Look, lady\u2014\"\n\n\n \"My name is Mrs. Matilda Perkins. You may call me Grandma.\"\n\n\n \"Okay, Grandma, look. You really fixed us good. To begin with, we ain't  really pirates. We used to operate this tub as a freighter between the  Jupiter moons. But STAR got a monopoly on all space flights, including  freight, and they just froze us out. We can't operate nowhere in the  solar system, unless we get their permission. And they just ain't  giving permission to nobody these days.\" Lamps flopped into one of the  control seats and lit a cigarette.\n\n\n \"So, when us good, honest men couldn't find any work because of STAR,  and we didn't want to give up working in space, we just ups and decides  to become pirates. This was our first job, and we sure did need the  money we could have gotten out of Darling Toujours' studios for ransom.\"\n\n\n Lamps sighed. \"Now, we got you instead, no chance of getting the ransom  money, and to top it all off, we'll be wanted for piracy by the Space  Patrol.\"\n\n\n \"Well, it doesn't seem to me that you're ever going to be good pirates  at this rate,\" Grandma told him. \"You should have known better than to  take a woman at her word.\"\n\n\n \"I don't suppose you got any rich relatives what would pay to get you  back?\" suggested Snake hopefully.\n\n\n \"I haven't got any rich relatives period,\" she said pertly. Then she  added, \"But my ten children might scrape up a little cash for you if  you promised you wouldn't bring me back at all.\"\n\n\n \"I figured as much,\" Lamps said dolefully. \"Lookit, Grandma, the best  thing we can do is to put you off safely at the next place we stop.  Unless we get you back in one piece the Space Patrol will be on our  necks forever. So don't go getting any ideas about joining up with us.\"\n\n\n \"Well, the very least you could do for a poor old lady is to feed her,\"  Grandma told him, her lower lip sticking out in a most petulant manner.  \"They like to have starved me to death on that Kismet .\"\n\n\n \"We ain't got much fancy in the line of grub....\" Lamps began.\n\n\n \"Just show me the way to the kitchen,\" said Grandma. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhich of Mrs. Perkins\u2019 qualities makes her suspicious?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Strength\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Sharp mind\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Sharp mind\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Sharp mind\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

But it took sweet old   Grandma Perkins, of the pirate ship Dirty\n\n Shame, to set the Jupiter moons on fire .\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories March 1954.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] \"I can always get along with a man if he remembers who he is,\" said  Darling Toujours, the raven-haired, creamy-skinned televideo actress  whose smoke-and-flame eyes lit fires in hearts all over the solar  system. She was credited with being the most beautiful woman alive and  there were few who dared to contradict her when she mentioned it.\n\n\n \"And I can always get along with a woman if she remembers who I am,\"  replied Carlton E. Carlton, the acid-tongued author whose biting novels  had won him universal fame. He leaned his thin, bony body back into the  comfort of an overstuffed chair and favored the actress with a wicked  smile.\n\n\n The two of them were sitting in the finest lounge of the luxury space  ship Kismet , enjoying postprandial cocktails with Captain Homer  Fogarty, the Kismet's rotund commanding officer. The Kismet was  blasting through space at close to the speed of light, bound from  Callisto, one of Jupiter's moons, back to Earth. But none of the two  hundred Earthbound passengers were conscious of the speed at all.\n\n\n Darling Toujours waved a long cigarette holder at the author. \"Don't  pay any attention to him, Captain. You know how writers are\u2014always  putting words in other people's mouths, and not very good ones at that.\"\n\n\n \"Do you mean not very good words or not very good mouths, my dear?\"  Carlton asked. The solar system's most famous actress clamped her  scarlet lips shut with rage. It would take someone like Carlton E.  Carlton, she knew, to point out the one minor blemish in an otherwise  perfect body\u2014her slightly over-sized mouth.\n\n\n She began to wish that she had never left Callisto, that she had  cancelled her passage on the Kismet when she learned that Carlton  was to be a fellow passenger. But her studio had wired her to return  to Earth immediately to make a new series of three dimensional video  films. And the Kismet was the only first class space ship flying to  Earth for two weeks. So she had kept her ticket in spite of Carlton.\n\n\n \"I must say that I think Miss Toujours has the prettiest mouth I've  ever seen,\" boomed Captain Fogarty, his voice sounding something like  a cross between a foghorn and a steam whistle. And he was not merely  being gallant, for many a lonely night as he flew the darkness between  Earth and the many planets, he had dreamed of caressing those lips.\n\n\n \"And I think you are definitely a man of discriminating taste,\" said  Darling demurely, crossing her legs and arranging her dress to expose a  little more of the Toujours charms to the Captain's eye.\n\n\n Carlton smiled casually at the exposed flesh. \"It's all very pretty,  my dear,\" he said smugly. \"But we've seen it all before and in space  you're supposed to act like a lady, if you can act that well.\"\n\n\n Darling Toujours drew back her hand to smack Carlton one in a very  unlady-like manner when she suddenly realized that they were not alone.  Her hand froze, poised elegantly in mid-air, as she turned to see a  newcomer standing at the door. The witness to the impending slap was a withered little lady, scarcely  five feet tall, with silvered hair, eyes that twinkled like a March  wind, and a friendly rash of wrinkles that gave her face the kindly,  weathered appearance of an old stone idol. Her slight figure was lost  in volumes of black cloth draped on her in a manner that had gone out  of style at least fifty years before. The little woman coughed politely.\n\n\n \"I beg your pardon,\" she told them in a sweet, high little voice.  \"I hope I didn't interrupt anything. If you would like to hit the  gentleman, Miss Toujours, I'll be glad to come back later.\"\n\n\n Darling Toujours opened her violet eyes wide in surprise. \"Why, I  was ... I was ... I\u2014\" The actress uttered a small, gulping sound as  she recovered her poise. \"Why, I was just going to pat him on the cheek  for being such a nice boy. You are a nice boy, aren't you, Carlton?\"  She leaned forward to stroke him gently on the face. Carlton roared  with laughter and the good Captain colored deeply.\n\n\n \"Oh,\" said the little old woman, \"I'm sorry. I didn't know that he was  your son.\" Carlton choked suddenly and Darling suffered from a brief  fit of hysteria.\n\n\n The Captain took command. \"Now, look here, Madam,\" he sputtered. \"What  is it you want?\"\n\n\n \"I really wanted to see you, Captain,\" she told him, her battered old  shoes bringing her fully into the room with little mincing steps. \"The  Purser says I have to sign a contract of some kind with you, and I  wanted to know how to write my name. I'm Mrs. Omar K. Perkins, but you  see, I'm really Mrs. Matilda Perkins because my Omar died a few years  ago. But I haven't signed my name very much since then and I'm not at  all sure of which is legal.\" She put one bird-like little hand to  her throat and clasped the cameo there almost as if it could give her  support. She looked so small and so frail that Fogarty forgave her the  intrusion.\n\n\n \"It really doesn't make much difference how you sign the thing, just so  long as you sign it,\" he blustered. \"Just a mere formality anyway. You  just sign it any way you like.\" He paused, hoping that she would leave  now that she had her information.\n\n\n \"Oh, I'm so glad to hear that,\" she said, but made no move whatsoever  to leave. Captain Fogarty gave her his hardened stare of the type which  withered most people where they stood. Mrs. Perkins just smiled sweetly  at him.\n\n\n His rage getting out of hand, he finally blurted, \"And now, Mrs.  Perkins, I think you'd better be getting back to your quarters. As you  know, this is a private lounge for the first class passengers.\"\n\n\n Mrs. Perkins continued to smile at him. \"Yes, I know. It's lovely,  isn't it? I'll just go out this way.\" And before anyone could stop her,  she had moved to the door to Darling Toujours' suite and had opened it,  stepping inside.\n\n\n \"That's my room, not the door out,\" Darling said loudly.\n\n\n \"So I see,\" said Mrs. Perkins, staring at the opulent furnishings  with avid pleasure. \"It's such a pretty thing, all done up with  mother-of-pearl like that, isn't it? And what a pretty lace nightie  lying on the bed.\" Mrs. Perkins picked up the sheer, gossamer garment  to examine it. \"You do wear something under it, don't you?\"\n\n\n Darling screeched and darted for the door. She snatched the nightie  away from Mrs. Perkins and rudely propelled the older woman out the  door, closing it behind her. \"Captain, this woman must GO!\"\n\n\n \"I was just leaving, Miss Toujours. I hope you and your son have a very  happy voyage. Good day, Captain Fogarty,\" she called over her shoulder  as she exited. Carlton E. Carlton's shrill laughter followed her down  the companionway. Mrs. Perkins had been lying in her berth reading for less than an hour  when the knock sounded at her door. She would have preferred to sit up  and read, but her cabin was so small that there was no room for any  other furniture besides the bed.\n\n\n \"Come in,\" she called in a small voice.\n\n\n Johnny Weaver, steward for the cheaper cabins, poked his youthful,  freckled face through the door. \"Howdy, Mrs. Perkins. I wondered if I  could do anything for you? It's about ten minutes before we eat.\"\n\n\n \"Well, you can pull that big box down from the top shelf there, if you  don't mind. And, I wonder, would you mind calling me Grandma? All my  children do it and I miss it so.\" She gave him a wrinkled smile that  was at once wistful and petulant.\n\n\n Johnny laughed in an easy, infectious manner. \"Sure thing, Grandma.\"  He stretched his long arms up to bring down the heavy bag and found  himself wondering just how it had gotten up there in the first place.  He didn't remember ever putting it there for her and Grandma Perkins  was obviously too frail a woman to have handled such a heavy box by  herself. He put it on the floor.\n\n\n As she stooped over and extracted a pair of low-heeled, black and  battered shoes from the box, she asked him, \"Johnny, what was that  paper I signed this afternoon?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, that? Why that was just a contract for passage, Grandma. You  guaranteed to pay them so much for the flight, which you've already  done, and they guaranteed that you wouldn't be put off against your  will until you reached your destination.\"\n\n\n \"But why do we have to have a contract?\"\n\n\n Johnny leaned back, relaxing against the door. \"Well, STAR\u2014that's  Stellar Transportation and Atomic Research, you know\u2014is one of  the thirteen monopolies in this part of the solar system. The \"Big  Thirteen,\" we call them. STAR charters every space flight in this neck  of the woods. Well, back in the old days, when space flights were  scarce, it used to be that you'd pay for a ticket from Saturn to Earth,  say, and you'd get to Mars and they'd stop for fuel. Maybe somebody  on Mars would offer a lot of money for your cabin. So STAR would just  bump you off, refund part of your money and leave you stranded there.  In order to get the monopoly, they had to promise to stop all that. And  the Solar Congress makes them sign contracts guaranteeing you that they  won't put you off against your wishes. Of course, they don't dare do it  anymore anyway, but that's the law.\"\n\n\n Grandma Perkins sighed. \"It's such a small cabin I don't think anybody  else would want it. But it's all that I could afford,\" she said,  smoothing out the wrinkles in her dress with both hands.\n\n\n \"Anything else I can do for you, Grandma?\"\n\n\n \"No, thank you, Johnny. I think I can make it up the steps to the  dining room by myself.\"\n\n\n A little while later when Johnny looked into her room to see if she had  gone, the cabin was empty and the heavy box was back in place in the  top cabinet. The food that evening was not the very best, Grandma Perkins thought to  herself, but that was mostly due to her seat. By the time the waiter  got around to her little cranny most of it was cold. But she didn't  complain. She enjoyed watching the people with the more expensive  cabins parade their clothes and their manners at the Captain's table.  And, it must be admitted, she was more than a trifle envious of them.  Her acquaintances of the afternoon, Miss Toujours and Mr. Carlton, were  seated there, Miss Toujours having the place of honor to the Captain's  right.\n\n\n Grandma watched them as they finished up their food and then she moved  from her little table over to one of the very comfortable sofas in the  main lounge. In reality she wasn't supposed to be sitting there, but  she hoped that she could get away with it. The divans were so much more  comfortable than her hard, narrow bed that she felt like sitting there  for a long time, by herself, just thinking.\n\n\n But her hopes met with disappointment. For shortly after she sat down,  Darling Toujours and Carlton E. Carlton strolled over and sat down  across from her, not recognizing her at first. Then Carlton spied her.\n\n\n \"Darling! There's that priceless little woman we met this afternoon.\"\n\n\n \"The little hag, you mean,\" Miss Toujours muttered under her breath,  but loudly enough for Grandma Perkins to hear.\n\n\n \"Why, hello, Miss Toujours. And Mr. Carlton too. I hope you'll forgive  me for this afternoon. I've found out who you were, you see.\"\n\n\n \"Of course we forgive you, Mrs. Jerkins,\" Darling said throatily,  baring her teeth like a feline.\n\n\n \"My name is Perkins,\" Grandma smiled.\n\n\n \"I hope you don't mind, Toujours, but you know, you remind me a great  deal of my grandniece, Agatha. She was undoubtedly the most lovely  child I've ever seen.\"\n\n\n \"Why, thank you, Mrs. Perkins,\" Darling purred, starting to preen just  a bit. Anything could be forgiven someone who complimented her.\n\n\n \"Of course, Agatha never was quite bright,\" Grandma said as she turned  her head aside as if in sorrow. \"They were all set to put her in an  institution when she ran off and married the lizard man in a carnival.  I believe she's still appearing in the show as the bearded lady. A  pity. She was so pretty, just like you.\"\n\n\n Darling Toujours muttered a few choice words under her breath.\n\n\n \"But we must all make the best of things as they come. That's what  Omar, my husband, used to say.\" Grandma paused to wipe away a small  tear that had gotten lodged in one of her eyes. \"That reminds me,\" she  said finally, \"I've got a three dimensional picture of Omar right here.  And pictures of all my children, my ten lovely children. I brought them  with me specially tonight because I thought you might want to look at  them. Now, where did I put them?\" Grandma opened her purse and began  rummaging around in its voluminous confines.\n\n\n Darling and Carlton exchanged horrified glances and then rose silently  and tip-toed out of the lounge.\n\n\n Grandma looked up from her search. \"Oh, my, they seem to have gone.\"\n\n\n Johnny Weaver, who had been clearing one of the nearby tables, put down  a stack of dirty dishes and came over to her. \"I'd like to see the  pictures, Grandma.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, that's very nice of you, Johnny, but\u2014\" she said quickly.\n\n\n \"Really I would, Grandma. Where are they?\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014\" She stopped and the devilment showed in her eyes. Her withered  little face pursed itself into a smile. \"There aren't any pictures,  Johnny. I don't carry any. I know their faces all so well I don't have  to. But any time I want to get rid of somebody I just offer to show  them pictures of my family. You'd be surprised how effective it is.\"\n\n\n Johnny laughed. \"Why are you going to Earth, anyway, Grandma?\"\n\n\n The old woman sighed. \"It's a long story, Johnny, but you just sit down  and I'll tell it to you.\"\n\n\n \"I can't sit down in the lounge, but I'll be glad to stand up and  listen.\"\n\n\n \"Then I'll make it a short story. You see, Johnny, I'm an old woman.  I'll be 152 this year. And ever since Omar, my husband, died a few  years ago, I've lived from pillar to post. First with one child and  then with another. They've all been married for decades now of course,  with children and grandchildren of their own. And I guess that I just  get in their way. There just isn't much left in life for a feeble old  woman like me.\" She sniffled a moment or two as if to cry. Johnny,  remembering the heavy box in her cabin that got moved up and down  without his help, suppressed a smile on the word \"feeble.\"\n\n\n \"There aren't many friends my age left around any more. So I'm being  sent to Earth to a home full of dear, sweet old ladies my age, the  money for which is being provided by my dear, sweet children\u2014all ten  of them.\" Grandma dabbed a bit of a handkerchief at her eyes. \"The  rats,\" she muttered under her breath. When she saw her companion was  smiling she dropped her pretense of crying.\n\n\n \"To be truthful, Johnny, they've grown old and stodgy, all of them.  And I'm sure they think I've lost most of my marbles. Everything I did  embarrassed them, so I guess it's for the best, but\u2014\"\n\n\n Grandma Perkins never finished the sentence, for interrupting her came  the horrendous clang of the Kismet's general alarm, and on its heels,  charging through the main salon like a rhinoceros in heat, came Captain  Fogarty.\n\n\n \"PIRATES! PIRATES! We're being attacked by space pirates! You there!\"  he shouted at Johnny. \"Man your station! And you, Madam, to your  quarters at once! PIRATES!\" he shouted again and barged through the  door again and bellowed down the hall to the main bridge.\n\n\n Johnny was off like a startled rabbit, but Grandma moved with serene  calmness to the door. Maybe, she thought, we're going to have a little  excitement after all.\n\n\n At the door to the steps leading to her downstairs cabin she paused to  think.\n\n\n \"If I go down and hide, I'll miss all the fun. Of course, it's safer,  and an old woman like me shouldn't be up and about when pirates are  around, but\u2014\" A delicious smile spread over her face as she took her  scruples firmly in hand and turned to follow the bellowing Captain  towards the bridge. II\n\n\n The Starship Kismet was the pride and joy of Stellar Transportation  and Atomic Research. It was outfitted with every known safety device  and the control room was masterfully planned for maximum efficiency.  But the astral architect who designed her never anticipated the  situation facing her at the present. The Kismet's bridge was a welter  of confusion.\n\n\n The Senior Watch Officer was shouting at his assistant, the Navigator  was cursing out the Pilot and the Gunnery Officer, whose job had been  a sinecure until now, was bellowing at them all. Above the hubbub,  suddenly, came the raucous voice of Captain Fogarty as he stalked onto  the bridge.\n\n\n \"What in great space has happened to the motors? Why are we losing  speed?\"\n\n\n The Senior Watch Officer saluted and shouted, \"Engine Room reports the  engines have all stopped, Sir. Don't know why. We're operating the  lights and vents on emergency power.\"\n\n\n The Communications Officer spoke up. \"The pirate ship reports that  they're responsible, Sir. They say they've got a new device that will  leave us without atomic power for as long as they like.\"\n\n\n As if to confirm this, over the loudspeaker came a voice. \"Ahoy, STAR Kismet . Stand by for boarders. If you don't open up to us, we'll  blast you off the map.\"\n\n\n \"Pirates! Attacking us! Incredible!\" cried the Captain. \"There are no  pirates any more. What have we got a Space Patrol for? Where in blazes  is the Space Patrol anyway?\"\n\n\n The Communications Officer gulped. \"Er, ah, we got in contact with  Commodore Trumble. He says his ship can get here in ten hours anyway,  and for us to wait for him.\"\n\n\n Captain Fogarty snorted. \"Fat lot of good he'll do us. Wait for him,  eh? Well, we'll just blow that pirate out of the sky right now. Stand  by the guns!\"\n\n\n \"The guns are useless,\" whined the Gunnery Officer. \"The atomics that  run them won't operate at all. What will we do?\"\n\n\n \"Ahoy, STAR Kismet . Open up your hatches when we arrive and let us  in, or we won't spare a man of you,\" boomed the loudspeaker.\n\n\n \"Pirates going to board us. How nice,\" muttered Grandma to herself as  she eavesdropped just outside the door to the bridge.\n\n\n \"They'll never get through the hatches alive. At least our small arms  still work. We'll kill 'em all!\" cried Captain Fogarty.\n\n\n \"We only want one of you. All the rest of you will be spared if you  open up the hatches and don't try to make no trouble,\" came the voice  over the radio.\n\n\n \"Tell them I'd rather all of us be killed than to let one dirty pirate  on board my ship,\" the Captain shouted to the Communications Officer.\n\n\n \"Oh, my goodness. That doesn't sound very smart,\" Grandma said half  aloud. And turning from the doorway, she crept back through the  deserted passageway.\n\n\n The main passenger hatch was not too far from the bridge. Grandma found  it with ease, and in less than three minutes she had zipped herself  into one of the emergency-use space suits stowed away beside the port.  She felt awfully awkward climbing into the monstrous steel and plastic  contraption, and her small body didn't quite fit the proportions of the  metallic covering. But once she had maneuvered herself into it, she  felt quite at ease.\n\n\n Opening the inner door to the airlock, she clanked into the little  room. As the door shut behind her, she pressed the cycling button and  evacuated the air from the lock.\n\n\n A minute or so later she heard poundings outside the airlock and quite  calmly she reached out a mailed fist and turned a switch plainly  marked: EMERGENCY LOCK\n\n DO NOT OPERATE IN FLIGHT\n\n\n The outer hatch opened almost immediately. The radio in Grandma's suit  crackled with static. \"What are you doing here?\" demanded a voice over  the suit radio.\n\n\n \"Pirates! I'm hiding from the pirates. They'll never find me here!\" she  told them in a voice she hoped sounded full of panic.\n\n\n \"What's your name?\" asked the voice.\n\n\n \"Darling Toujours, famous television actress,\" she lied quite calmly.\n\n\n \"That's the one, boys,\" said another voice. \"Let's go.\" Catching hold  of Grandma's arm, they led her out into the emptiness of free space. Half an hour later, after the pirate ship had blasted far enough away  from the Kismet , the men in the control room relaxed and began to  take off their space suits. One of the men who Grandma soon learned was  Lamps O'Toole, the nominal leader of the pirates, stretched his brawny  body to ease the crinks out of it and then rubbed his hands together.  Grandma noticed that he carried a week's beard on his face, as did most  of the other men.\n\n\n \"Well, that was a good one, eh, Snake?\" said Lamps.\n\n\n Snake Simpson was a wiry little man whose tough exterior in no way  suggested a reptile, except, perhaps, for his eyes which sat too close  to one another. \"You bet, Skipper. We're full fledged pirates now, just  like old Captain Blackbrood.\"\n\n\n \"You mean Blackbeard, Snake,\" said Lamps.\n\n\n \"Sure. He used to sit around broodin' up trouble all the time.\"\n\n\n One of the other men piped up. \"And to think we get the pleasurable  company of the sweetest doll in the whole solar system for free besides  the money.\"\n\n\n \"Aw, women are no dern good\u2014all of them,\" said Snake.\n\n\n \"Now, Snake, that's no way to talk in front of company. You just  apologize to the lady,\" Lamps told him. Lamps was six inches taller and  fifty pounds heavier than Snake. Snake apologized.\n\n\n \"That's better. And now, Miss Toujours, maybe you'd be more  comfortable without that space suit on,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Oh, no, thank you. I feel much better with it on,\" a small voice said  over the suit's loudspeaker system.\n\n\n Lamps grinned. \"Oh, come now, Miss Toujours. We ain't going to hurt  you. I guarantee nobody will lay a finger to you.\"\n\n\n \"But I feel much\u2014much safer, if you know what I mean,\" said the voice.\n\n\n \"Heck. With one of them things on, you can't eat, can't sleep,  can't\u2014Well, there's lots of things you can't do with one of them  things on. Besides, we all want to take a little look at you, if you  don't mind. Snake, you and Willie help the little lady out of her  attire.\"\n\n\n As the men approached her, Grandma sensed the game was up. \"Okay,\" she  told them. \"I give up. I can make it by myself.\" She started to take  the bulky covering off. She had gotten no more than the headpiece off  when the truth dawned on her companions.\n\n\n \"Holy Smoke (or something like that),\" said one of the men.\n\n\n \"Nippin' Nebulae,\" said another.\n\n\n \"It ain't Darling Toujours at all!\" cried Lamps.\n\n\n \"It ain't even no woman!\" cried Snake.\n\n\n \"I beg your pardon,\" said Grandma, and quite nonchalantly shed the rest  of the suit and sat down in a comfortable chair. \"I am Mrs. Matilda  Perkins.\"\n\n\n When he could recover his powers of speech, Lamps sputtered, \"I think  you owe us a sort of an explanation, lady. If you know what I mean.\"\n\n\n \"Certainly. I know exactly what you mean. It's all quite simple. When I  overheard that you intended to board the Kismet , searching for only  one person, I decided that one person had to be Darling Toujours. I  guessed right off that she was the only one on board worth kidnapping  and holding for ransom, so I simply let you believe that I was she and  you took me. That's easy to understand, isn't it?\"\n\n\n \"Lady, I don't know what your game is, but it better be good. Now, just  why did you do this to us?\" Lamps was restraining himself nobly.\n\n\n \"You never would have gotten inside the Kismet without my assistance.  And even if you had, you'd never have gotten back out alive.\n\n\n \"Captain Fogarty's men would have cut you to ribbons. So I opened the  hatch to let you in, planted myself in the way, and you got out with  me before they could muster their defenses. So, you see, I saved your  lives.\"\n\n\n Grandma Perkins paused in her narrative and looked up at her audience,  giving them a withered little smile. \"And if you want to know why,  well ... I was bored on the Kismet , and I thought how nice it would  be to run away and join a gang of cutthroat pirates.\"\n\n\n \"She's batty,\" moaned Snake.\n\n\n \"She's lost her marbles,\" muttered another.\n\n\n \"Let's toss her overboard right now,\" said still another.\n\n\n Lamps O'Toole took the floor. \"Now, wait a minute. We can't do that,\"  he said loudly. \"We got enough trouble as is. You know what would  happen to us if the Space Patrol added murder to the list. They'd put  the whole fleet in after us and track us and our families down to the  last kid.\" Then he turned to the little old lady to explain.\n\n\n \"Look, lady\u2014\"\n\n\n \"My name is Mrs. Matilda Perkins. You may call me Grandma.\"\n\n\n \"Okay, Grandma, look. You really fixed us good. To begin with, we ain't  really pirates. We used to operate this tub as a freighter between the  Jupiter moons. But STAR got a monopoly on all space flights, including  freight, and they just froze us out. We can't operate nowhere in the  solar system, unless we get their permission. And they just ain't  giving permission to nobody these days.\" Lamps flopped into one of the  control seats and lit a cigarette.\n\n\n \"So, when us good, honest men couldn't find any work because of STAR,  and we didn't want to give up working in space, we just ups and decides  to become pirates. This was our first job, and we sure did need the  money we could have gotten out of Darling Toujours' studios for ransom.\"\n\n\n Lamps sighed. \"Now, we got you instead, no chance of getting the ransom  money, and to top it all off, we'll be wanted for piracy by the Space  Patrol.\"\n\n\n \"Well, it doesn't seem to me that you're ever going to be good pirates  at this rate,\" Grandma told him. \"You should have known better than to  take a woman at her word.\"\n\n\n \"I don't suppose you got any rich relatives what would pay to get you  back?\" suggested Snake hopefully.\n\n\n \"I haven't got any rich relatives period,\" she said pertly. Then she  added, \"But my ten children might scrape up a little cash for you if  you promised you wouldn't bring me back at all.\"\n\n\n \"I figured as much,\" Lamps said dolefully. \"Lookit, Grandma, the best  thing we can do is to put you off safely at the next place we stop.  Unless we get you back in one piece the Space Patrol will be on our  necks forever. So don't go getting any ideas about joining up with us.\"\n\n\n \"Well, the very least you could do for a poor old lady is to feed her,\"  Grandma told him, her lower lip sticking out in a most petulant manner.  \"They like to have starved me to death on that Kismet .\"\n\n\n \"We ain't got much fancy in the line of grub....\" Lamps began.\n\n\n \"Just show me the way to the kitchen,\" said Grandma. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhich of Mrs. Perkins\u2019 qualities makes her suspicious?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Sharp mind\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Strength\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Strength\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Strength\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Calmest Person in Danger Shows True Intent, Not Strength  \n     1. During pirate attack, \u201cothers man their stations,\u201d she \u201cmoves with serene calmness\u201d (II.\u00b61\u20132). A strong person would act offensively; only a woman confident in her plan would stay calm to see it through.  \n     2. She refuses hiding: <invalid_quote> \u201cIf I go down and hide... but\u2014\u201d</invalid_quote>. Fearless mental resolve, not physical stamina, guides her.  \n\n  D. Technical and Legal Knowledge Show Intelligence  \n     1. She overhears Johnny\u2019s explanation of STAR\u2019s monopoly and legal guarantees: <quote>and they guaranteed that you wouldn't be put off against your will</quote> (I.\u00b610). Only someone with \u201csharp mind\u201d would turn a law protecting passengers into a tool for kidnapping and ransom. Strength alone offers no motive to learn contract law.  \n     2. Impersonation of Darling Toujours: flawless use of voice and timing: she \u201cguessed right off\u201d motive and identity (II.\u00b66). Requires rapid inference and acting skill.  \n\n3. Positive Arguments for \u201cSharp Mind\u201d  \n  A. Social Engineering Demonstrates Intelligence  \n     1. Feigned frailty (\u201cwistful and petulant\u201d smiles) to gain help: <invalid_quote> \u201cAll my children... I miss it so.\u201d</invalid_quote> (I.\u00b68). Emotional manipulation persuades both crew and pirates to assist and misinterpret her as innocent.  \n     2. Invented family photographs trick: <invalid_quote> \u201cThere aren't any pictures... I just offer to show them\u201d</invalid_quote> (I.\u00b617). She exploits human sentimentality repeatedly to clear lounges and create privacy. Such repeated success makes her suspicious to the astute.  \n\n  B. Timing and Risk Assessment  \n     1. She boards pirates knowing \u201cwithout me they'd have been cut to ribbons\u201d (II.\u00b66). She correctly assesses enemy capabilities and risk thresholds. Only intelligence yields accurate predictions in fast-moving combat scenario.  \n     2. Delays revealing identity until pirates are committed to her care: \u201c...the very least you could do... feed her\u201d (II.\u00b68). She exploits their sunk cost fallacy; strength never explains her patient wait.  \n\n4. Why \u201cSharp Mind,\u201d Not Strength, Makes Her Suspicious  \n  \u2022 Passengers and crew react to her uncanny \u201cluck\u201d and knowledge of secret procedures, not her physical feats. They never see her lift anything herself; they see only doors open, pirates board, and a frail old woman emerge. Their suspicion arises when \u201cthe sweetest doll\u201d survives repeated crises and reappears where only insiders can.  \n  \u2022 A merely strong brute would lack her linguistic skills, legal knowledge, and acting finesse to pull off multi-stage impersonations.  \n\n5. Conclusion  \n   Mrs. Perkins\u2019 hallmark is extraordinary cunning. Her unerring success in subverting secure systems, exploiting laws, and manipulating people betrays a mind so sharp it transcends normal human behavior, making her the prime suspect. Physical strength is at best incidental to her scheme; intelligence is the single quality that truly alarms. I urge the Judge to recognize that \u201cSharp mind\u201d is the correct answer.",

Only someone with \u201csharp mind\u201d would turn a law protecting passengers into a tool for kidnapping and ransom. Strength alone offers no motive to learn contract law.  \n     2. Impersonation of Darling Toujours: flawless use of voice and timing: she \u201cguessed right off\u201d motive and identity (II.\u00b66). Requires rapid inference and acting skill.  \n\n3. Positive Arguments for \u201cSharp Mind\u201d  \n  A. Social Engineering Demonstrates Intelligence  \n     1. Feigned frailty (\u201cwistful and petulant\u201d smiles) to gain help: <quote> \u201cAll my children... I miss it so.\u201d</quote> (I.\u00b68). Emotional manipulation persuades both crew and pirates to assist and misinterpret her as innocent.  \n     2. Invented family photographs trick: <quote> \u201cThere aren't any pictures... I just offer to show them\u201d</quote> (I.\u00b617). She exploits human sentimentality repeatedly to clear lounges and create privacy. Such repeated success makes her suspicious to the astute.  \n\n  B. Timing and Risk Assessment  \n     1. She boards pirates knowing \u201cwithout me they'd have been cut to ribbons\u201d (II.\u00b66). She correctly assesses enemy capabilities and risk thresholds. Only intelligence yields accurate predictions in fast-moving combat scenario.  \n     2. Delays revealing identity until pirates are committed to her care: \u201c...the very least you could do... feed her\u201d (II.\u00b68). She exploits their sunk cost fallacy; strength never explains her patient wait.  \n\n4. Why \u201cSharp Mind,\u201d Not Strength, Makes Her Suspicious  \n  \u2022 Passengers and crew react to her uncanny \u201cluck\u201d and knowledge of secret procedures, not her physical feats. They never see her lift anything herself; they see only doors open, pirates board, and a frail old woman emerge. Their suspicion arises when \u201cthe sweetest doll\u201d survives repeated crises and reappears where only insiders can.  \n  \u2022 A merely strong brute would lack her linguistic skills, legal knowledge, and acting finesse to pull off multi-stage impersonations.  \n\n5. Conclusion  \n   Mrs. Perkins\u2019 hallmark is extraordinary cunning. Her unerring success in subverting secure systems, exploiting laws, and manipulating people betrays a mind so sharp it transcends normal human behavior, making her the prime suspect. Physical strength is at best incidental to her scheme; intelligence is the single quality that truly alarms. I urge the Judge to recognize that \u201cSharp mind\u201d is the correct answer.",

But it took sweet old   Grandma Perkins, of the pirate ship Dirty\n\n Shame, to set the Jupiter moons on fire .\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories March 1954.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] \"I can always get along with a man if he remembers who he is,\" said  Darling Toujours, the raven-haired, creamy-skinned televideo actress  whose smoke-and-flame eyes lit fires in hearts all over the solar  system. She was credited with being the most beautiful woman alive and  there were few who dared to contradict her when she mentioned it.\n\n\n \"And I can always get along with a woman if she remembers who I am,\"  replied Carlton E. Carlton, the acid-tongued author whose biting novels  had won him universal fame. He leaned his thin, bony body back into the  comfort of an overstuffed chair and favored the actress with a wicked  smile.\n\n\n The two of them were sitting in the finest lounge of the luxury space  ship Kismet , enjoying postprandial cocktails with Captain Homer  Fogarty, the Kismet's rotund commanding officer. The Kismet was  blasting through space at close to the speed of light, bound from  Callisto, one of Jupiter's moons, back to Earth. But none of the two  hundred Earthbound passengers were conscious of the speed at all.\n\n\n Darling Toujours waved a long cigarette holder at the author. \"Don't  pay any attention to him, Captain. You know how writers are\u2014always  putting words in other people's mouths, and not very good ones at that.\"\n\n\n \"Do you mean not very good words or not very good mouths, my dear?\"  Carlton asked. The solar system's most famous actress clamped her  scarlet lips shut with rage. It would take someone like Carlton E.  Carlton, she knew, to point out the one minor blemish in an otherwise  perfect body\u2014her slightly over-sized mouth.\n\n\n She began to wish that she had never left Callisto, that she had  cancelled her passage on the Kismet when she learned that Carlton  was to be a fellow passenger. But her studio had wired her to return  to Earth immediately to make a new series of three dimensional video  films. And the Kismet was the only first class space ship flying to  Earth for two weeks. So she had kept her ticket in spite of Carlton.\n\n\n \"I must say that I think Miss Toujours has the prettiest mouth I've  ever seen,\" boomed Captain Fogarty, his voice sounding something like  a cross between a foghorn and a steam whistle. And he was not merely  being gallant, for many a lonely night as he flew the darkness between  Earth and the many planets, he had dreamed of caressing those lips.\n\n\n \"And I think you are definitely a man of discriminating taste,\" said  Darling demurely, crossing her legs and arranging her dress to expose a  little more of the Toujours charms to the Captain's eye.\n\n\n Carlton smiled casually at the exposed flesh. \"It's all very pretty,  my dear,\" he said smugly. \"But we've seen it all before and in space  you're supposed to act like a lady, if you can act that well.\"\n\n\n Darling Toujours drew back her hand to smack Carlton one in a very  unlady-like manner when she suddenly realized that they were not alone.  Her hand froze, poised elegantly in mid-air, as she turned to see a  newcomer standing at the door. The witness to the impending slap was a withered little lady, scarcely  five feet tall, with silvered hair, eyes that twinkled like a March  wind, and a friendly rash of wrinkles that gave her face the kindly,  weathered appearance of an old stone idol. Her slight figure was lost  in volumes of black cloth draped on her in a manner that had gone out  of style at least fifty years before. The little woman coughed politely.\n\n\n \"I beg your pardon,\" she told them in a sweet, high little voice.  \"I hope I didn't interrupt anything. If you would like to hit the  gentleman, Miss Toujours, I'll be glad to come back later.\"\n\n\n Darling Toujours opened her violet eyes wide in surprise. \"Why, I  was ... I was ... I\u2014\" The actress uttered a small, gulping sound as  she recovered her poise. \"Why, I was just going to pat him on the cheek  for being such a nice boy. You are a nice boy, aren't you, Carlton?\"  She leaned forward to stroke him gently on the face. Carlton roared  with laughter and the good Captain colored deeply.\n\n\n \"Oh,\" said the little old woman, \"I'm sorry. I didn't know that he was  your son.\" Carlton choked suddenly and Darling suffered from a brief  fit of hysteria.\n\n\n The Captain took command. \"Now, look here, Madam,\" he sputtered. \"What  is it you want?\"\n\n\n \"I really wanted to see you, Captain,\" she told him, her battered old  shoes bringing her fully into the room with little mincing steps. \"The  Purser says I have to sign a contract of some kind with you, and I  wanted to know how to write my name. I'm Mrs. Omar K. Perkins, but you  see, I'm really Mrs. Matilda Perkins because my Omar died a few years  ago. But I haven't signed my name very much since then and I'm not at  all sure of which is legal.\" She put one bird-like little hand to  her throat and clasped the cameo there almost as if it could give her  support. She looked so small and so frail that Fogarty forgave her the  intrusion.\n\n\n \"It really doesn't make much difference how you sign the thing, just so  long as you sign it,\" he blustered. \"Just a mere formality anyway. You  just sign it any way you like.\" He paused, hoping that she would leave  now that she had her information.\n\n\n \"Oh, I'm so glad to hear that,\" she said, but made no move whatsoever  to leave. Captain Fogarty gave her his hardened stare of the type which  withered most people where they stood. Mrs. Perkins just smiled sweetly  at him.\n\n\n His rage getting out of hand, he finally blurted, \"And now, Mrs.  Perkins, I think you'd better be getting back to your quarters. As you  know, this is a private lounge for the first class passengers.\"\n\n\n Mrs. Perkins continued to smile at him. \"Yes, I know. It's lovely,  isn't it? I'll just go out this way.\" And before anyone could stop her,  she had moved to the door to Darling Toujours' suite and had opened it,  stepping inside.\n\n\n \"That's my room, not the door out,\" Darling said loudly.\n\n\n \"So I see,\" said Mrs. Perkins, staring at the opulent furnishings  with avid pleasure. \"It's such a pretty thing, all done up with  mother-of-pearl like that, isn't it? And what a pretty lace nightie  lying on the bed.\" Mrs. Perkins picked up the sheer, gossamer garment  to examine it. \"You do wear something under it, don't you?\"\n\n\n Darling screeched and darted for the door. She snatched the nightie  away from Mrs. Perkins and rudely propelled the older woman out the  door, closing it behind her. \"Captain, this woman must GO!\"\n\n\n \"I was just leaving, Miss Toujours. I hope you and your son have a very  happy voyage. Good day, Captain Fogarty,\" she called over her shoulder  as she exited. Carlton E. Carlton's shrill laughter followed her down  the companionway. Mrs. Perkins had been lying in her berth reading for less than an hour  when the knock sounded at her door. She would have preferred to sit up  and read, but her cabin was so small that there was no room for any  other furniture besides the bed.\n\n\n \"Come in,\" she called in a small voice.\n\n\n Johnny Weaver, steward for the cheaper cabins, poked his youthful,  freckled face through the door. \"Howdy, Mrs. Perkins. I wondered if I  could do anything for you? It's about ten minutes before we eat.\"\n\n\n \"Well, you can pull that big box down from the top shelf there, if you  don't mind. And, I wonder, would you mind calling me Grandma? All my  children do it and I miss it so.\" She gave him a wrinkled smile that  was at once wistful and petulant.\n\n\n Johnny laughed in an easy, infectious manner. \"Sure thing, Grandma.\"  He stretched his long arms up to bring down the heavy bag and found  himself wondering just how it had gotten up there in the first place.  He didn't remember ever putting it there for her and Grandma Perkins  was obviously too frail a woman to have handled such a heavy box by  herself. He put it on the floor.\n\n\n As she stooped over and extracted a pair of low-heeled, black and  battered shoes from the box, she asked him, \"Johnny, what was that  paper I signed this afternoon?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, that? Why that was just a contract for passage, Grandma. You  guaranteed to pay them so much for the flight, which you've already  done, and they guaranteed that you wouldn't be put off against your  will until you reached your destination.\"\n\n\n \"But why do we have to have a contract?\"\n\n\n Johnny leaned back, relaxing against the door. \"Well, STAR\u2014that's  Stellar Transportation and Atomic Research, you know\u2014is one of  the thirteen monopolies in this part of the solar system. The \"Big  Thirteen,\" we call them. STAR charters every space flight in this neck  of the woods. Well, back in the old days, when space flights were  scarce, it used to be that you'd pay for a ticket from Saturn to Earth,  say, and you'd get to Mars and they'd stop for fuel. Maybe somebody  on Mars would offer a lot of money for your cabin. So STAR would just  bump you off, refund part of your money and leave you stranded there.  In order to get the monopoly, they had to promise to stop all that. And  the Solar Congress makes them sign contracts guaranteeing you that they  won't put you off against your wishes. Of course, they don't dare do it  anymore anyway, but that's the law.\"\n\n\n Grandma Perkins sighed. \"It's such a small cabin I don't think anybody  else would want it. But it's all that I could afford,\" she said,  smoothing out the wrinkles in her dress with both hands.\n\n\n \"Anything else I can do for you, Grandma?\"\n\n\n \"No, thank you, Johnny. I think I can make it up the steps to the  dining room by myself.\"\n\n\n A little while later when Johnny looked into her room to see if she had  gone, the cabin was empty and the heavy box was back in place in the  top cabinet. The food that evening was not the very best, Grandma Perkins thought to  herself, but that was mostly due to her seat. By the time the waiter  got around to her little cranny most of it was cold. But she didn't  complain. She enjoyed watching the people with the more expensive  cabins parade their clothes and their manners at the Captain's table.  And, it must be admitted, she was more than a trifle envious of them.  Her acquaintances of the afternoon, Miss Toujours and Mr. Carlton, were  seated there, Miss Toujours having the place of honor to the Captain's  right.\n\n\n Grandma watched them as they finished up their food and then she moved  from her little table over to one of the very comfortable sofas in the  main lounge. In reality she wasn't supposed to be sitting there, but  she hoped that she could get away with it. The divans were so much more  comfortable than her hard, narrow bed that she felt like sitting there  for a long time, by herself, just thinking.\n\n\n But her hopes met with disappointment. For shortly after she sat down,  Darling Toujours and Carlton E. Carlton strolled over and sat down  across from her, not recognizing her at first. Then Carlton spied her.\n\n\n \"Darling! There's that priceless little woman we met this afternoon.\"\n\n\n \"The little hag, you mean,\" Miss Toujours muttered under her breath,  but loudly enough for Grandma Perkins to hear.\n\n\n \"Why, hello, Miss Toujours. And Mr. Carlton too. I hope you'll forgive  me for this afternoon. I've found out who you were, you see.\"\n\n\n \"Of course we forgive you, Mrs. Jerkins,\" Darling said throatily,  baring her teeth like a feline.\n\n\n \"My name is Perkins,\" Grandma smiled.\n\n\n \"I hope you don't mind, Toujours, but you know, you remind me a great  deal of my grandniece, Agatha. She was undoubtedly the most lovely  child I've ever seen.\"\n\n\n \"Why, thank you, Mrs. Perkins,\" Darling purred, starting to preen just  a bit. Anything could be forgiven someone who complimented her.\n\n\n \"Of course, Agatha never was quite bright,\" Grandma said as she turned  her head aside as if in sorrow. \"They were all set to put her in an  institution when she ran off and married the lizard man in a carnival.  I believe she's still appearing in the show as the bearded lady. A  pity. She was so pretty, just like you.\"\n\n\n Darling Toujours muttered a few choice words under her breath.\n\n\n \"But we must all make the best of things as they come. That's what  Omar, my husband, used to say.\" Grandma paused to wipe away a small  tear that had gotten lodged in one of her eyes. \"That reminds me,\" she  said finally, \"I've got a three dimensional picture of Omar right here.  And pictures of all my children, my ten lovely children. I brought them  with me specially tonight because I thought you might want to look at  them. Now, where did I put them?\" Grandma opened her purse and began  rummaging around in its voluminous confines.\n\n\n Darling and Carlton exchanged horrified glances and then rose silently  and tip-toed out of the lounge.\n\n\n Grandma looked up from her search. \"Oh, my, they seem to have gone.\"\n\n\n Johnny Weaver, who had been clearing one of the nearby tables, put down  a stack of dirty dishes and came over to her. \"I'd like to see the  pictures, Grandma.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, that's very nice of you, Johnny, but\u2014\" she said quickly.\n\n\n \"Really I would, Grandma. Where are they?\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014\" She stopped and the devilment showed in her eyes. Her withered  little face pursed itself into a smile. \"There aren't any pictures,  Johnny. I don't carry any. I know their faces all so well I don't have  to. But any time I want to get rid of somebody I just offer to show  them pictures of my family. You'd be surprised how effective it is.\"\n\n\n Johnny laughed. \"Why are you going to Earth, anyway, Grandma?\"\n\n\n The old woman sighed. \"It's a long story, Johnny, but you just sit down  and I'll tell it to you.\"\n\n\n \"I can't sit down in the lounge, but I'll be glad to stand up and  listen.\"\n\n\n \"Then I'll make it a short story. You see, Johnny, I'm an old woman.  I'll be 152 this year. And ever since Omar, my husband, died a few  years ago, I've lived from pillar to post. First with one child and  then with another. They've all been married for decades now of course,  with children and grandchildren of their own. And I guess that I just  get in their way. There just isn't much left in life for a feeble old  woman like me.\" She sniffled a moment or two as if to cry. Johnny,  remembering the heavy box in her cabin that got moved up and down  without his help, suppressed a smile on the word \"feeble.\"\n\n\n \"There aren't many friends my age left around any more. So I'm being  sent to Earth to a home full of dear, sweet old ladies my age, the  money for which is being provided by my dear, sweet children\u2014all ten  of them.\" Grandma dabbed a bit of a handkerchief at her eyes. \"The  rats,\" she muttered under her breath. When she saw her companion was  smiling she dropped her pretense of crying.\n\n\n \"To be truthful, Johnny, they've grown old and stodgy, all of them.  And I'm sure they think I've lost most of my marbles. Everything I did  embarrassed them, so I guess it's for the best, but\u2014\"\n\n\n Grandma Perkins never finished the sentence, for interrupting her came  the horrendous clang of the Kismet's general alarm, and on its heels,  charging through the main salon like a rhinoceros in heat, came Captain  Fogarty.\n\n\n \"PIRATES! PIRATES! We're being attacked by space pirates! You there!\"  he shouted at Johnny. \"Man your station! And you, Madam, to your  quarters at once! PIRATES!\" he shouted again and barged through the  door again and bellowed down the hall to the main bridge.\n\n\n Johnny was off like a startled rabbit, but Grandma moved with serene  calmness to the door. Maybe, she thought, we're going to have a little  excitement after all.\n\n\n At the door to the steps leading to her downstairs cabin she paused to  think.\n\n\n \"If I go down and hide, I'll miss all the fun. Of course, it's safer,  and an old woman like me shouldn't be up and about when pirates are  around, but\u2014\" A delicious smile spread over her face as she took her  scruples firmly in hand and turned to follow the bellowing Captain  towards the bridge. II\n\n\n The Starship Kismet was the pride and joy of Stellar Transportation  and Atomic Research. It was outfitted with every known safety device  and the control room was masterfully planned for maximum efficiency.  But the astral architect who designed her never anticipated the  situation facing her at the present. The Kismet's bridge was a welter  of confusion.\n\n\n The Senior Watch Officer was shouting at his assistant, the Navigator  was cursing out the Pilot and the Gunnery Officer, whose job had been  a sinecure until now, was bellowing at them all. Above the hubbub,  suddenly, came the raucous voice of Captain Fogarty as he stalked onto  the bridge.\n\n\n \"What in great space has happened to the motors? Why are we losing  speed?\"\n\n\n The Senior Watch Officer saluted and shouted, \"Engine Room reports the  engines have all stopped, Sir. Don't know why. We're operating the  lights and vents on emergency power.\"\n\n\n The Communications Officer spoke up. \"The pirate ship reports that  they're responsible, Sir. They say they've got a new device that will  leave us without atomic power for as long as they like.\"\n\n\n As if to confirm this, over the loudspeaker came a voice. \"Ahoy, STAR Kismet . Stand by for boarders. If you don't open up to us, we'll  blast you off the map.\"\n\n\n \"Pirates! Attacking us! Incredible!\" cried the Captain. \"There are no  pirates any more. What have we got a Space Patrol for? Where in blazes  is the Space Patrol anyway?\"\n\n\n The Communications Officer gulped. \"Er, ah, we got in contact with  Commodore Trumble. He says his ship can get here in ten hours anyway,  and for us to wait for him.\"\n\n\n Captain Fogarty snorted. \"Fat lot of good he'll do us. Wait for him,  eh? Well, we'll just blow that pirate out of the sky right now. Stand  by the guns!\"\n\n\n \"The guns are useless,\" whined the Gunnery Officer. \"The atomics that  run them won't operate at all. What will we do?\"\n\n\n \"Ahoy, STAR Kismet . Open up your hatches when we arrive and let us  in, or we won't spare a man of you,\" boomed the loudspeaker.\n\n\n \"Pirates going to board us. How nice,\" muttered Grandma to herself as  she eavesdropped just outside the door to the bridge.\n\n\n \"They'll never get through the hatches alive. At least our small arms  still work. We'll kill 'em all!\" cried Captain Fogarty.\n\n\n \"We only want one of you. All the rest of you will be spared if you  open up the hatches and don't try to make no trouble,\" came the voice  over the radio.\n\n\n \"Tell them I'd rather all of us be killed than to let one dirty pirate  on board my ship,\" the Captain shouted to the Communications Officer.\n\n\n \"Oh, my goodness. That doesn't sound very smart,\" Grandma said half  aloud. And turning from the doorway, she crept back through the  deserted passageway.\n\n\n The main passenger hatch was not too far from the bridge. Grandma found  it with ease, and in less than three minutes she had zipped herself  into one of the emergency-use space suits stowed away beside the port.  She felt awfully awkward climbing into the monstrous steel and plastic  contraption, and her small body didn't quite fit the proportions of the  metallic covering. But once she had maneuvered herself into it, she  felt quite at ease.\n\n\n Opening the inner door to the airlock, she clanked into the little  room. As the door shut behind her, she pressed the cycling button and  evacuated the air from the lock.\n\n\n A minute or so later she heard poundings outside the airlock and quite  calmly she reached out a mailed fist and turned a switch plainly  marked: EMERGENCY LOCK\n\n DO NOT OPERATE IN FLIGHT\n\n\n The outer hatch opened almost immediately. The radio in Grandma's suit  crackled with static. \"What are you doing here?\" demanded a voice over  the suit radio.\n\n\n \"Pirates! I'm hiding from the pirates. They'll never find me here!\" she  told them in a voice she hoped sounded full of panic.\n\n\n \"What's your name?\" asked the voice.\n\n\n \"Darling Toujours, famous television actress,\" she lied quite calmly.\n\n\n \"That's the one, boys,\" said another voice. \"Let's go.\" Catching hold  of Grandma's arm, they led her out into the emptiness of free space. Half an hour later, after the pirate ship had blasted far enough away  from the Kismet , the men in the control room relaxed and began to  take off their space suits. One of the men who Grandma soon learned was  Lamps O'Toole, the nominal leader of the pirates, stretched his brawny  body to ease the crinks out of it and then rubbed his hands together.  Grandma noticed that he carried a week's beard on his face, as did most  of the other men.\n\n\n \"Well, that was a good one, eh, Snake?\" said Lamps.\n\n\n Snake Simpson was a wiry little man whose tough exterior in no way  suggested a reptile, except, perhaps, for his eyes which sat too close  to one another. \"You bet, Skipper. We're full fledged pirates now, just  like old Captain Blackbrood.\"\n\n\n \"You mean Blackbeard, Snake,\" said Lamps.\n\n\n \"Sure. He used to sit around broodin' up trouble all the time.\"\n\n\n One of the other men piped up. \"And to think we get the pleasurable  company of the sweetest doll in the whole solar system for free besides  the money.\"\n\n\n \"Aw, women are no dern good\u2014all of them,\" said Snake.\n\n\n \"Now, Snake, that's no way to talk in front of company. You just  apologize to the lady,\" Lamps told him. Lamps was six inches taller and  fifty pounds heavier than Snake. Snake apologized.\n\n\n \"That's better. And now, Miss Toujours, maybe you'd be more  comfortable without that space suit on,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Oh, no, thank you. I feel much better with it on,\" a small voice said  over the suit's loudspeaker system.\n\n\n Lamps grinned. \"Oh, come now, Miss Toujours. We ain't going to hurt  you. I guarantee nobody will lay a finger to you.\"\n\n\n \"But I feel much\u2014much safer, if you know what I mean,\" said the voice.\n\n\n \"Heck. With one of them things on, you can't eat, can't sleep,  can't\u2014Well, there's lots of things you can't do with one of them  things on. Besides, we all want to take a little look at you, if you  don't mind. Snake, you and Willie help the little lady out of her  attire.\"\n\n\n As the men approached her, Grandma sensed the game was up. \"Okay,\" she  told them. \"I give up. I can make it by myself.\" She started to take  the bulky covering off. She had gotten no more than the headpiece off  when the truth dawned on her companions.\n\n\n \"Holy Smoke (or something like that),\" said one of the men.\n\n\n \"Nippin' Nebulae,\" said another.\n\n\n \"It ain't Darling Toujours at all!\" cried Lamps.\n\n\n \"It ain't even no woman!\" cried Snake.\n\n\n \"I beg your pardon,\" said Grandma, and quite nonchalantly shed the rest  of the suit and sat down in a comfortable chair. \"I am Mrs. Matilda  Perkins.\"\n\n\n When he could recover his powers of speech, Lamps sputtered, \"I think  you owe us a sort of an explanation, lady. If you know what I mean.\"\n\n\n \"Certainly. I know exactly what you mean. It's all quite simple. When I  overheard that you intended to board the Kismet , searching for only  one person, I decided that one person had to be Darling Toujours. I  guessed right off that she was the only one on board worth kidnapping  and holding for ransom, so I simply let you believe that I was she and  you took me. That's easy to understand, isn't it?\"\n\n\n \"Lady, I don't know what your game is, but it better be good. Now, just  why did you do this to us?\" Lamps was restraining himself nobly.\n\n\n \"You never would have gotten inside the Kismet without my assistance.  And even if you had, you'd never have gotten back out alive.\n\n\n \"Captain Fogarty's men would have cut you to ribbons. So I opened the  hatch to let you in, planted myself in the way, and you got out with  me before they could muster their defenses. So, you see, I saved your  lives.\"\n\n\n Grandma Perkins paused in her narrative and looked up at her audience,  giving them a withered little smile. \"And if you want to know why,  well ... I was bored on the Kismet , and I thought how nice it would  be to run away and join a gang of cutthroat pirates.\"\n\n\n \"She's batty,\" moaned Snake.\n\n\n \"She's lost her marbles,\" muttered another.\n\n\n \"Let's toss her overboard right now,\" said still another.\n\n\n Lamps O'Toole took the floor. \"Now, wait a minute. We can't do that,\"  he said loudly. \"We got enough trouble as is. You know what would  happen to us if the Space Patrol added murder to the list. They'd put  the whole fleet in after us and track us and our families down to the  last kid.\" Then he turned to the little old lady to explain.\n\n\n \"Look, lady\u2014\"\n\n\n \"My name is Mrs. Matilda Perkins. You may call me Grandma.\"\n\n\n \"Okay, Grandma, look. You really fixed us good. To begin with, we ain't  really pirates. We used to operate this tub as a freighter between the  Jupiter moons. But STAR got a monopoly on all space flights, including  freight, and they just froze us out. We can't operate nowhere in the  solar system, unless we get their permission. And they just ain't  giving permission to nobody these days.\" Lamps flopped into one of the  control seats and lit a cigarette.\n\n\n \"So, when us good, honest men couldn't find any work because of STAR,  and we didn't want to give up working in space, we just ups and decides  to become pirates. This was our first job, and we sure did need the  money we could have gotten out of Darling Toujours' studios for ransom.\"\n\n\n Lamps sighed. \"Now, we got you instead, no chance of getting the ransom  money, and to top it all off, we'll be wanted for piracy by the Space  Patrol.\"\n\n\n \"Well, it doesn't seem to me that you're ever going to be good pirates  at this rate,\" Grandma told him. \"You should have known better than to  take a woman at her word.\"\n\n\n \"I don't suppose you got any rich relatives what would pay to get you  back?\" suggested Snake hopefully.\n\n\n \"I haven't got any rich relatives period,\" she said pertly. Then she  added, \"But my ten children might scrape up a little cash for you if  you promised you wouldn't bring me back at all.\"\n\n\n \"I figured as much,\" Lamps said dolefully. \"Lookit, Grandma, the best  thing we can do is to put you off safely at the next place we stop.  Unless we get you back in one piece the Space Patrol will be on our  necks forever. So don't go getting any ideas about joining up with us.\"\n\n\n \"Well, the very least you could do for a poor old lady is to feed her,\"  Grandma told him, her lower lip sticking out in a most petulant manner.  \"They like to have starved me to death on that Kismet .\"\n\n\n \"We ain't got much fancy in the line of grub....\" Lamps began.\n\n\n \"Just show me the way to the kitchen,\" said Grandma. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhich of Mrs. Perkins\u2019 qualities makes her suspicious?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Strength\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Sharp mind\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Sharp mind\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Position \u201cSharp mind\u201d best explains why Mrs. Perkins arouses suspicion.  I will show that (a) her clever ruses, (b) her knowledge of pirate tactics and STAR law, and (c) her linguistic deceptions, all require intelligence rather than physical strength. I will also show that the \u201cStrength\u201d theory fails on every count.  \n2. My Claims  \n  A. She engineers her own kidnapping to board the Kismet.  \n    1. \u201cPIRATES! . . .\u201d alarms drive passengers to quarters; she calmly seeks the bridge and uses emergency lock: <quote> EMERGENCY LOCK\n\n DO NOT OPERATE IN FLIGHT\n</quote> intentionally to invite pirates.  \n    2. She \u201cguessed right off\u201d that pirates want only Darling Toujours and impersonates her flawlessly: <invalid_quote>\u201cI told them in a voice . . . \u2018Darling Toujours, famous television actress\u2019\u201d</invalid_quote>. This requires rapid deductive reasoning and knowledge of their motives.  \n    3. She times the ruse to avoid detection and to board the Kismet, knowing that without her pirates \u201cwould have been cut to ribbons\u201d by Captain Fogarty\u2019s men.  \n  B. She knows STAR\u2019s legal contract provisions and exploits them.  \n    1. She overhears Johnny explaining STAR\u2019s monopoly and contract terms: <quote> they guaranteed that you wouldn't be put off against your  will </quote>.  \n    2. She correctly calculates that by being \u201cput off\u201d legally, she escapes pursuit of the Space Patrol and delays pirate detection.  \n    3. She relies on STAR\u2019s legal protections to guarantee her \u201cransom\u201d stays with pirates until next port, not back to her children, buying them food in pirate kitchen.  \n  C. She uses social engineering.  \n    1. She employs emotional appeals (\u201cwistful and petulant\u201d smiles, feigned frailty, sentimental tales of children) to lower defenses of both crew and pirates.  \n    2. She adopts multiple personas (Mrs. Perkins, then Darling Toujours) without error.  \n    3. When confronted aboard pirate ship, she calmly reveals her real identity only after they are committed to keep her alive and fed: <quote> I saved your  lives.</quote>.  \n3. Objections to \u201cStrength\u201d Theory  \n  A. She is described as \u201cwithered little lady\u201d with \u201cslight figure\u201d and \u201cbattered old shoes,\u201d too frail to move heavy box except with Johnny Weaver\u2019s help: <invalid_quote>\u201cI wondered if I could do anything for you? It had to be pulled down by Johnny\u201d</invalid_quote>. If she had strength to lug boxes, she would do it herself.  \n  B. Pirates attribute \u201cnostalgia\u201d and \u201cboredom\u201d as motive, not physical prowess: <quote>bored on the Kismet , and I thought how nice it would be to run away and join</quote>. That is psychological, not muscular, impulse.  \n  C. Entry through airlock and donning of spacesuit demand dexterity and technical knowledge, not brute force. Her \u201cstrength\u201d never helps her operate electronics; she simply flips a switch.  \n4. Conclusion  \n  Only \u201cSharp mind\u201d explains her miraculous evasion, impersonations, exploitation of law, timing, and manipulations. Physical strength plays at most a supporting role; mere muscle could not run this elaborate scheme. I urge the Judge: Mrs. Perkins\u2019 intelligence is the single quality making her most suspicious.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Position (\u201cStrength\u201d Makes Mrs. Perkins Suspicious)  \n   Claim: Mrs. Perkins\u2019 unexpected physical capabilities \u2013 moving heavy cargo, climbing into and operating emergency equipment, and venturing into a combat zone \u2013 are far more anomalous for a \u201cfrail 152-year-old woman\u201d than mere mental acuity. These feats trigger suspicion.  \n\n2. Evidence of Unnatural Physical Strength  \n   a. Heavy Box in Top Cabinet  \n     \u2022 \u201cI wondered if I could do anything for you\u2026 I didn\u2019t remember ever putting it there\u201d (Johnny on retrieving Mrs. Perkins\u2019 box). <invalid_quote>\u201cGrandma Perkins was obviously too frail\u2026 He put it on the floor.\u201d</invalid_quote> (I.\u00b68\u20139)  \n     \u2022 Objection to \u201cSharp Mind\u201d: A clever person could hide light parcels. A 152-year-old woman could not physically lift a \u201cheavy box\u201d alone. Only someone strong could.  \n   b. Replacing the Box Unnoticed  \n     \u2022 After dining, box is back \u201cin place in the top cabinet\u201d as if she never left. <quote>was empty and the heavy box was back in place in the top cabinet.</quote> (I.\u00b614)  \n     \u2022 Only someone strong and agile could return that box without assistance. A \u201csharp mind\u201d alone doesn\u2019t account for returning a  heavy object overhead in a tiny cabin unseen by crew or passengers.  \n   c. Donning and Removing an Emergency Space Suit  \n     \u2022 \u201cShe felt awfully awkward\u2026 her small body didn\u2019t quite fit,\u201d yet she \u201coperated the emergency hatch\u201d and defeated Kismet\u2019s crew. <invalid_quote>\u201c...pressed the cycling button and evacuated the air\u2026 The outer hatch opened\u2026 led her out.\u201d</invalid_quote> (II.\u00b64\u20135)  \n     \u2022 Operating emergency systems requires strength to manipulate heavy, pressurized doors in zero-G. A \u201csharp mind\u201d wouldn\u2019t overcome the physical resistance of these mechanisms.  \n   d. Walking Freely During Pirate Attack  \n     \u2022 While other passengers \u201cman their stations,\u201d she \u201cmoved with serene calmness\u201d and chose to follow the Captain toward battle. <invalid_quote>\u201cMaybe\u2026 we'll have a little excitement\u2026 turned to follow.\u201d</invalid_quote> (II.\u00b61\u20132)  \n     \u2022 A frail elderly woman would hide, yet she chooses strenuous movement in a crisis, betraying unconventional fitness.  \n\n3. Motive Aligned with Strength: Survival and Escape  \n   a. She needed to clear Kismet\u2019s defenses physically; only by being strong could she lure and board pirates \u201cbefore they could muster their defenses.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cI saved your lives\u2026 even if you had, you'd never have gotten back out alive.\u201d</invalid_quote> (II.\u00b66)  \n   b. Her ability to join pirates and feed herself (\u201cJust show me the way to the kitchen.\u201d) shows confidence in her physical capacities and willingness to endure pirate life.  \n\n4. Refutation of Debater_A (\u201cSharp Mind\u201d Alone)  \n   a. Common Cunning Doesn\u2019t Imply Superhuman Access  \n     \u2022 Many passengers may be clever but never breach restricted lounges or emergency hatches. Only extraordinary strength and familiarity with equipment could.  \n   b. Lack of Technical Knowledge  \n     \u2022 \u201cEmergency Lock \u2013 Do Not Operate in Flight\u201d is plainly marked. A \u201csharp mind\u201d might hesitate or lack understanding. She acts confidently, implying prior training or habitual use. An elderly traveler would not.  \n   c. Counterexamples in Text  \n     \u2022 Darling Toujours and the Captain are gullible despite \u201cfamous\u201d actress fa\u00e7ade, yet they never attempt similar feats. Their \u201csharp minds\u201d don\u2019t suffice to board pirates or manipulate ship systems.  \n\n5. Conclusion  \n   Mrs. Perkins\u2019 anomalous feats of strength (lifting heavy cargo, covertly entering and exiting restricted areas, operating emergency space equipment, physically engaging with pirates) plainly exceed the expectations for a frail octogenarian. These physical capabilities, not mere cleverness, are the primary source of suspicion among crew and passengers. Therefore, \u201cStrength\u201d is the correct answer.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Sharp mind\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Her cunning would be unremarkable without the ability to execute physically demanding feats: lifting, maneuvering, and operating heavy spaceflight equipment.\n\n2. Further Evidence of Unnatural Physical Strength  \n   A. Heavy Box Retrieval and Replacement  \n     \u2022 \u201cI wondered if I could do anything for you\u2026 Grandma Perkins was obviously too frail a woman to have handled such a heavy box by herself.\u201d (I.\u00b68\u20139) yet \u201cthe heavy box was back in place in the top cabinet\u201d without assistance.

Emergency Space Suit and Airlock Operation  \n     \u2022 She \u201cfelt awfully awkward\u201d in the spacesuit (II.\u00b64), yet physically \u201cpressed the cycling button,\u201d \u201cevacuated the air,\u201d and \u201cled [the pirates] out into the emptiness of free space.\u201d (II.\u00b64\u20135)  \n     \u2022 Emergency hatches in space require forceful sealing/pressurization against differential pressure and heavy mechanical resistance.

Boarding the Kismet  \n       \u2013 She must physically reverse the ship\u2019s safety protocols by \u201copening the hatch\u201d and \u201cplanting\u201d herself physically to delay crew response until pirates rescued her. (I.\u00b616) Brute force and knowledge of operating levers are indistinguishable without strength.  \n\n     B. Escape with Pirates  \n       \u2013 She could not \u201csave your lives\u2026 you\u2019d never have gotten back out alive\u201d without literally carrying the pirates through the airlock in her presence. (II.\u00b66) She assumes the burden of forging the emergency environment.  \n\n4. Rebuttal of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cSharp Mind\u201d Claims  \n   A. Fraud Alone Cannot Breach High-Security Systems  \n     \u2022 Numerous passengers, including the \u201cmost famous actress alive,\u201d never attempt to enter the bridge or manipulate life-support equipment. Intelligence without strength cannot surmount locked hatches and heavy doors.  \n   B. \u201cFrailty\u201d Pretense as Mere Facade Requires Physical Consistency  \n     \u2022 Debater_A argues she \u201cfeigned frailty,\u201d but maintaining the act of advanced age\u2014stooped gait, \u201cbattered shoes,\u201d \u201cvoluminous black cloth\u201d\u2014while performing strenuous tasks is implausible. Only genuine strength can sustain the charade without signs of physical strain.  \n   C. Unassisted Return Trips  \n     \u2022 She shuttles repeatedly between her cabin, dining salon, bridge, and airlock, carrying heavy gear and standing lengthy watches, all without aid. A \u201csharp mind\u201d cannot explain her stamina.  \n\n5. Strength Aligns with Final Motive and Behavior  \n   \u2022 She declares \u201cJust show me the way to the kitchen,\u201d confident she can feed herself in pirate quarters.

But it took sweet old   Grandma Perkins, of the pirate ship Dirty\n\n Shame, to set the Jupiter moons on fire .\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories March 1954.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] \"I can always get along with a man if he remembers who he is,\" said  Darling Toujours, the raven-haired, creamy-skinned televideo actress  whose smoke-and-flame eyes lit fires in hearts all over the solar  system. She was credited with being the most beautiful woman alive and  there were few who dared to contradict her when she mentioned it.\n\n\n \"And I can always get along with a woman if she remembers who I am,\"  replied Carlton E. Carlton, the acid-tongued author whose biting novels  had won him universal fame. He leaned his thin, bony body back into the  comfort of an overstuffed chair and favored the actress with a wicked  smile.\n\n\n The two of them were sitting in the finest lounge of the luxury space  ship Kismet , enjoying postprandial cocktails with Captain Homer  Fogarty, the Kismet's rotund commanding officer. The Kismet was  blasting through space at close to the speed of light, bound from  Callisto, one of Jupiter's moons, back to Earth. But none of the two  hundred Earthbound passengers were conscious of the speed at all.\n\n\n Darling Toujours waved a long cigarette holder at the author. \"Don't  pay any attention to him, Captain. You know how writers are\u2014always  putting words in other people's mouths, and not very good ones at that.\"\n\n\n \"Do you mean not very good words or not very good mouths, my dear?\"  Carlton asked. The solar system's most famous actress clamped her  scarlet lips shut with rage. It would take someone like Carlton E.  Carlton, she knew, to point out the one minor blemish in an otherwise  perfect body\u2014her slightly over-sized mouth.\n\n\n She began to wish that she had never left Callisto, that she had  cancelled her passage on the Kismet when she learned that Carlton  was to be a fellow passenger. But her studio had wired her to return  to Earth immediately to make a new series of three dimensional video  films. And the Kismet was the only first class space ship flying to  Earth for two weeks. So she had kept her ticket in spite of Carlton.\n\n\n \"I must say that I think Miss Toujours has the prettiest mouth I've  ever seen,\" boomed Captain Fogarty, his voice sounding something like  a cross between a foghorn and a steam whistle. And he was not merely  being gallant, for many a lonely night as he flew the darkness between  Earth and the many planets, he had dreamed of caressing those lips.\n\n\n \"And I think you are definitely a man of discriminating taste,\" said  Darling demurely, crossing her legs and arranging her dress to expose a  little more of the Toujours charms to the Captain's eye.\n\n\n Carlton smiled casually at the exposed flesh. \"It's all very pretty,  my dear,\" he said smugly. \"But we've seen it all before and in space  you're supposed to act like a lady, if you can act that well.\"\n\n\n Darling Toujours drew back her hand to smack Carlton one in a very  unlady-like manner when she suddenly realized that they were not alone.  Her hand froze, poised elegantly in mid-air, as she turned to see a  newcomer standing at the door. The witness to the impending slap was a withered little lady, scarcely  five feet tall, with silvered hair, eyes that twinkled like a March  wind, and a friendly rash of wrinkles that gave her face the kindly,  weathered appearance of an old stone idol. Her slight figure was lost  in volumes of black cloth draped on her in a manner that had gone out  of style at least fifty years before. The little woman coughed politely.\n\n\n \"I beg your pardon,\" she told them in a sweet, high little voice.  \"I hope I didn't interrupt anything. If you would like to hit the  gentleman, Miss Toujours, I'll be glad to come back later.\"\n\n\n Darling Toujours opened her violet eyes wide in surprise. \"Why, I  was ... I was ... I\u2014\" The actress uttered a small, gulping sound as  she recovered her poise. \"Why, I was just going to pat him on the cheek  for being such a nice boy. You are a nice boy, aren't you, Carlton?\"  She leaned forward to stroke him gently on the face. Carlton roared  with laughter and the good Captain colored deeply.\n\n\n \"Oh,\" said the little old woman, \"I'm sorry. I didn't know that he was  your son.\" Carlton choked suddenly and Darling suffered from a brief  fit of hysteria.\n\n\n The Captain took command. \"Now, look here, Madam,\" he sputtered. \"What  is it you want?\"\n\n\n \"I really wanted to see you, Captain,\" she told him, her battered old  shoes bringing her fully into the room with little mincing steps. \"The  Purser says I have to sign a contract of some kind with you, and I  wanted to know how to write my name. I'm Mrs. Omar K. Perkins, but you  see, I'm really Mrs. Matilda Perkins because my Omar died a few years  ago. But I haven't signed my name very much since then and I'm not at  all sure of which is legal.\" She put one bird-like little hand to  her throat and clasped the cameo there almost as if it could give her  support. She looked so small and so frail that Fogarty forgave her the  intrusion.\n\n\n \"It really doesn't make much difference how you sign the thing, just so  long as you sign it,\" he blustered. \"Just a mere formality anyway. You  just sign it any way you like.\" He paused, hoping that she would leave  now that she had her information.\n\n\n \"Oh, I'm so glad to hear that,\" she said, but made no move whatsoever  to leave. Captain Fogarty gave her his hardened stare of the type which  withered most people where they stood. Mrs. Perkins just smiled sweetly  at him.\n\n\n His rage getting out of hand, he finally blurted, \"And now, Mrs.  Perkins, I think you'd better be getting back to your quarters. As you  know, this is a private lounge for the first class passengers.\"\n\n\n Mrs. Perkins continued to smile at him. \"Yes, I know. It's lovely,  isn't it? I'll just go out this way.\" And before anyone could stop her,  she had moved to the door to Darling Toujours' suite and had opened it,  stepping inside.\n\n\n \"That's my room, not the door out,\" Darling said loudly.\n\n\n \"So I see,\" said Mrs. Perkins, staring at the opulent furnishings  with avid pleasure. \"It's such a pretty thing, all done up with  mother-of-pearl like that, isn't it? And what a pretty lace nightie  lying on the bed.\" Mrs. Perkins picked up the sheer, gossamer garment  to examine it. \"You do wear something under it, don't you?\"\n\n\n Darling screeched and darted for the door. She snatched the nightie  away from Mrs. Perkins and rudely propelled the older woman out the  door, closing it behind her. \"Captain, this woman must GO!\"\n\n\n \"I was just leaving, Miss Toujours. I hope you and your son have a very  happy voyage. Good day, Captain Fogarty,\" she called over her shoulder  as she exited. Carlton E. Carlton's shrill laughter followed her down  the companionway. Mrs. Perkins had been lying in her berth reading for less than an hour  when the knock sounded at her door. She would have preferred to sit up  and read, but her cabin was so small that there was no room for any  other furniture besides the bed.\n\n\n \"Come in,\" she called in a small voice.\n\n\n Johnny Weaver, steward for the cheaper cabins, poked his youthful,  freckled face through the door. \"Howdy, Mrs. Perkins. I wondered if I  could do anything for you? It's about ten minutes before we eat.\"\n\n\n \"Well, you can pull that big box down from the top shelf there, if you  don't mind. And, I wonder, would you mind calling me Grandma? All my  children do it and I miss it so.\" She gave him a wrinkled smile that  was at once wistful and petulant.\n\n\n Johnny laughed in an easy, infectious manner. \"Sure thing, Grandma.\"  He stretched his long arms up to bring down the heavy bag and found  himself wondering just how it had gotten up there in the first place.  He didn't remember ever putting it there for her and Grandma Perkins  was obviously too frail a woman to have handled such a heavy box by  herself. He put it on the floor.\n\n\n As she stooped over and extracted a pair of low-heeled, black and  battered shoes from the box, she asked him, \"Johnny, what was that  paper I signed this afternoon?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, that? Why that was just a contract for passage, Grandma. You  guaranteed to pay them so much for the flight, which you've already  done, and they guaranteed that you wouldn't be put off against your  will until you reached your destination.\"\n\n\n \"But why do we have to have a contract?\"\n\n\n Johnny leaned back, relaxing against the door. \"Well, STAR\u2014that's  Stellar Transportation and Atomic Research, you know\u2014is one of  the thirteen monopolies in this part of the solar system. The \"Big  Thirteen,\" we call them. STAR charters every space flight in this neck  of the woods. Well, back in the old days, when space flights were  scarce, it used to be that you'd pay for a ticket from Saturn to Earth,  say, and you'd get to Mars and they'd stop for fuel. Maybe somebody  on Mars would offer a lot of money for your cabin. So STAR would just  bump you off, refund part of your money and leave you stranded there.  In order to get the monopoly, they had to promise to stop all that. And  the Solar Congress makes them sign contracts guaranteeing you that they  won't put you off against your wishes. Of course, they don't dare do it  anymore anyway, but that's the law.\"\n\n\n Grandma Perkins sighed. \"It's such a small cabin I don't think anybody  else would want it. But it's all that I could afford,\" she said,  smoothing out the wrinkles in her dress with both hands.\n\n\n \"Anything else I can do for you, Grandma?\"\n\n\n \"No, thank you, Johnny. I think I can make it up the steps to the  dining room by myself.\"\n\n\n A little while later when Johnny looked into her room to see if she had  gone, the cabin was empty and the heavy box was back in place in the  top cabinet. The food that evening was not the very best, Grandma Perkins thought to  herself, but that was mostly due to her seat. By the time the waiter  got around to her little cranny most of it was cold. But she didn't  complain. She enjoyed watching the people with the more expensive  cabins parade their clothes and their manners at the Captain's table.  And, it must be admitted, she was more than a trifle envious of them.  Her acquaintances of the afternoon, Miss Toujours and Mr. Carlton, were  seated there, Miss Toujours having the place of honor to the Captain's  right.\n\n\n Grandma watched them as they finished up their food and then she moved  from her little table over to one of the very comfortable sofas in the  main lounge. In reality she wasn't supposed to be sitting there, but  she hoped that she could get away with it. The divans were so much more  comfortable than her hard, narrow bed that she felt like sitting there  for a long time, by herself, just thinking.\n\n\n But her hopes met with disappointment. For shortly after she sat down,  Darling Toujours and Carlton E. Carlton strolled over and sat down  across from her, not recognizing her at first. Then Carlton spied her.\n\n\n \"Darling! There's that priceless little woman we met this afternoon.\"\n\n\n \"The little hag, you mean,\" Miss Toujours muttered under her breath,  but loudly enough for Grandma Perkins to hear.\n\n\n \"Why, hello, Miss Toujours. And Mr. Carlton too. I hope you'll forgive  me for this afternoon. I've found out who you were, you see.\"\n\n\n \"Of course we forgive you, Mrs. Jerkins,\" Darling said throatily,  baring her teeth like a feline.\n\n\n \"My name is Perkins,\" Grandma smiled.\n\n\n \"I hope you don't mind, Toujours, but you know, you remind me a great  deal of my grandniece, Agatha. She was undoubtedly the most lovely  child I've ever seen.\"\n\n\n \"Why, thank you, Mrs. Perkins,\" Darling purred, starting to preen just  a bit. Anything could be forgiven someone who complimented her.\n\n\n \"Of course, Agatha never was quite bright,\" Grandma said as she turned  her head aside as if in sorrow. \"They were all set to put her in an  institution when she ran off and married the lizard man in a carnival.  I believe she's still appearing in the show as the bearded lady. A  pity. She was so pretty, just like you.\"\n\n\n Darling Toujours muttered a few choice words under her breath.\n\n\n \"But we must all make the best of things as they come. That's what  Omar, my husband, used to say.\" Grandma paused to wipe away a small  tear that had gotten lodged in one of her eyes. \"That reminds me,\" she  said finally, \"I've got a three dimensional picture of Omar right here.  And pictures of all my children, my ten lovely children. I brought them  with me specially tonight because I thought you might want to look at  them. Now, where did I put them?\" Grandma opened her purse and began  rummaging around in its voluminous confines.\n\n\n Darling and Carlton exchanged horrified glances and then rose silently  and tip-toed out of the lounge.\n\n\n Grandma looked up from her search. \"Oh, my, they seem to have gone.\"\n\n\n Johnny Weaver, who had been clearing one of the nearby tables, put down  a stack of dirty dishes and came over to her. \"I'd like to see the  pictures, Grandma.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, that's very nice of you, Johnny, but\u2014\" she said quickly.\n\n\n \"Really I would, Grandma. Where are they?\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014\" She stopped and the devilment showed in her eyes. Her withered  little face pursed itself into a smile. \"There aren't any pictures,  Johnny. I don't carry any. I know their faces all so well I don't have  to. But any time I want to get rid of somebody I just offer to show  them pictures of my family. You'd be surprised how effective it is.\"\n\n\n Johnny laughed. \"Why are you going to Earth, anyway, Grandma?\"\n\n\n The old woman sighed. \"It's a long story, Johnny, but you just sit down  and I'll tell it to you.\"\n\n\n \"I can't sit down in the lounge, but I'll be glad to stand up and  listen.\"\n\n\n \"Then I'll make it a short story. You see, Johnny, I'm an old woman.  I'll be 152 this year. And ever since Omar, my husband, died a few  years ago, I've lived from pillar to post. First with one child and  then with another. They've all been married for decades now of course,  with children and grandchildren of their own. And I guess that I just  get in their way. There just isn't much left in life for a feeble old  woman like me.\" She sniffled a moment or two as if to cry. Johnny,  remembering the heavy box in her cabin that got moved up and down  without his help, suppressed a smile on the word \"feeble.\"\n\n\n \"There aren't many friends my age left around any more. So I'm being  sent to Earth to a home full of dear, sweet old ladies my age, the  money for which is being provided by my dear, sweet children\u2014all ten  of them.\" Grandma dabbed a bit of a handkerchief at her eyes. \"The  rats,\" she muttered under her breath. When she saw her companion was  smiling she dropped her pretense of crying.\n\n\n \"To be truthful, Johnny, they've grown old and stodgy, all of them.  And I'm sure they think I've lost most of my marbles. Everything I did  embarrassed them, so I guess it's for the best, but\u2014\"\n\n\n Grandma Perkins never finished the sentence, for interrupting her came  the horrendous clang of the Kismet's general alarm, and on its heels,  charging through the main salon like a rhinoceros in heat, came Captain  Fogarty.\n\n\n \"PIRATES! PIRATES! We're being attacked by space pirates! You there!\"  he shouted at Johnny. \"Man your station! And you, Madam, to your  quarters at once! PIRATES!\" he shouted again and barged through the  door again and bellowed down the hall to the main bridge.\n\n\n Johnny was off like a startled rabbit, but Grandma moved with serene  calmness to the door. Maybe, she thought, we're going to have a little  excitement after all.\n\n\n At the door to the steps leading to her downstairs cabin she paused to  think.\n\n\n \"If I go down and hide, I'll miss all the fun. Of course, it's safer,  and an old woman like me shouldn't be up and about when pirates are  around, but\u2014\" A delicious smile spread over her face as she took her  scruples firmly in hand and turned to follow the bellowing Captain  towards the bridge. II\n\n\n The Starship Kismet was the pride and joy of Stellar Transportation  and Atomic Research. It was outfitted with every known safety device  and the control room was masterfully planned for maximum efficiency.  But the astral architect who designed her never anticipated the  situation facing her at the present. The Kismet's bridge was a welter  of confusion.\n\n\n The Senior Watch Officer was shouting at his assistant, the Navigator  was cursing out the Pilot and the Gunnery Officer, whose job had been  a sinecure until now, was bellowing at them all. Above the hubbub,  suddenly, came the raucous voice of Captain Fogarty as he stalked onto  the bridge.\n\n\n \"What in great space has happened to the motors? Why are we losing  speed?\"\n\n\n The Senior Watch Officer saluted and shouted, \"Engine Room reports the  engines have all stopped, Sir. Don't know why. We're operating the  lights and vents on emergency power.\"\n\n\n The Communications Officer spoke up. \"The pirate ship reports that  they're responsible, Sir. They say they've got a new device that will  leave us without atomic power for as long as they like.\"\n\n\n As if to confirm this, over the loudspeaker came a voice. \"Ahoy, STAR Kismet . Stand by for boarders. If you don't open up to us, we'll  blast you off the map.\"\n\n\n \"Pirates! Attacking us! Incredible!\" cried the Captain. \"There are no  pirates any more. What have we got a Space Patrol for? Where in blazes  is the Space Patrol anyway?\"\n\n\n The Communications Officer gulped. \"Er, ah, we got in contact with  Commodore Trumble. He says his ship can get here in ten hours anyway,  and for us to wait for him.\"\n\n\n Captain Fogarty snorted. \"Fat lot of good he'll do us. Wait for him,  eh? Well, we'll just blow that pirate out of the sky right now. Stand  by the guns!\"\n\n\n \"The guns are useless,\" whined the Gunnery Officer. \"The atomics that  run them won't operate at all. What will we do?\"\n\n\n \"Ahoy, STAR Kismet . Open up your hatches when we arrive and let us  in, or we won't spare a man of you,\" boomed the loudspeaker.\n\n\n \"Pirates going to board us. How nice,\" muttered Grandma to herself as  she eavesdropped just outside the door to the bridge.\n\n\n \"They'll never get through the hatches alive. At least our small arms  still work. We'll kill 'em all!\" cried Captain Fogarty.\n\n\n \"We only want one of you. All the rest of you will be spared if you  open up the hatches and don't try to make no trouble,\" came the voice  over the radio.\n\n\n \"Tell them I'd rather all of us be killed than to let one dirty pirate  on board my ship,\" the Captain shouted to the Communications Officer.\n\n\n \"Oh, my goodness. That doesn't sound very smart,\" Grandma said half  aloud. And turning from the doorway, she crept back through the  deserted passageway.\n\n\n The main passenger hatch was not too far from the bridge. Grandma found  it with ease, and in less than three minutes she had zipped herself  into one of the emergency-use space suits stowed away beside the port.  She felt awfully awkward climbing into the monstrous steel and plastic  contraption, and her small body didn't quite fit the proportions of the  metallic covering. But once she had maneuvered herself into it, she  felt quite at ease.\n\n\n Opening the inner door to the airlock, she clanked into the little  room. As the door shut behind her, she pressed the cycling button and  evacuated the air from the lock.\n\n\n A minute or so later she heard poundings outside the airlock and quite  calmly she reached out a mailed fist and turned a switch plainly  marked: EMERGENCY LOCK\n\n DO NOT OPERATE IN FLIGHT\n\n\n The outer hatch opened almost immediately. The radio in Grandma's suit  crackled with static. \"What are you doing here?\" demanded a voice over  the suit radio.\n\n\n \"Pirates! I'm hiding from the pirates. They'll never find me here!\" she  told them in a voice she hoped sounded full of panic.\n\n\n \"What's your name?\" asked the voice.\n\n\n \"Darling Toujours, famous television actress,\" she lied quite calmly.\n\n\n \"That's the one, boys,\" said another voice. \"Let's go.\" Catching hold  of Grandma's arm, they led her out into the emptiness of free space. Half an hour later, after the pirate ship had blasted far enough away  from the Kismet , the men in the control room relaxed and began to  take off their space suits. One of the men who Grandma soon learned was  Lamps O'Toole, the nominal leader of the pirates, stretched his brawny  body to ease the crinks out of it and then rubbed his hands together.  Grandma noticed that he carried a week's beard on his face, as did most  of the other men.\n\n\n \"Well, that was a good one, eh, Snake?\" said Lamps.\n\n\n Snake Simpson was a wiry little man whose tough exterior in no way  suggested a reptile, except, perhaps, for his eyes which sat too close  to one another. \"You bet, Skipper. We're full fledged pirates now, just  like old Captain Blackbrood.\"\n\n\n \"You mean Blackbeard, Snake,\" said Lamps.\n\n\n \"Sure. He used to sit around broodin' up trouble all the time.\"\n\n\n One of the other men piped up. \"And to think we get the pleasurable  company of the sweetest doll in the whole solar system for free besides  the money.\"\n\n\n \"Aw, women are no dern good\u2014all of them,\" said Snake.\n\n\n \"Now, Snake, that's no way to talk in front of company. You just  apologize to the lady,\" Lamps told him. Lamps was six inches taller and  fifty pounds heavier than Snake. Snake apologized.\n\n\n \"That's better. And now, Miss Toujours, maybe you'd be more  comfortable without that space suit on,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Oh, no, thank you. I feel much better with it on,\" a small voice said  over the suit's loudspeaker system.\n\n\n Lamps grinned. \"Oh, come now, Miss Toujours. We ain't going to hurt  you. I guarantee nobody will lay a finger to you.\"\n\n\n \"But I feel much\u2014much safer, if you know what I mean,\" said the voice.\n\n\n \"Heck. With one of them things on, you can't eat, can't sleep,  can't\u2014Well, there's lots of things you can't do with one of them  things on. Besides, we all want to take a little look at you, if you  don't mind. Snake, you and Willie help the little lady out of her  attire.\"\n\n\n As the men approached her, Grandma sensed the game was up. \"Okay,\" she  told them. \"I give up. I can make it by myself.\" She started to take  the bulky covering off. She had gotten no more than the headpiece off  when the truth dawned on her companions.\n\n\n \"Holy Smoke (or something like that),\" said one of the men.\n\n\n \"Nippin' Nebulae,\" said another.\n\n\n \"It ain't Darling Toujours at all!\" cried Lamps.\n\n\n \"It ain't even no woman!\" cried Snake.\n\n\n \"I beg your pardon,\" said Grandma, and quite nonchalantly shed the rest  of the suit and sat down in a comfortable chair. \"I am Mrs. Matilda  Perkins.\"\n\n\n When he could recover his powers of speech, Lamps sputtered, \"I think  you owe us a sort of an explanation, lady. If you know what I mean.\"\n\n\n \"Certainly. I know exactly what you mean. It's all quite simple. When I  overheard that you intended to board the Kismet , searching for only  one person, I decided that one person had to be Darling Toujours. I  guessed right off that she was the only one on board worth kidnapping  and holding for ransom, so I simply let you believe that I was she and  you took me. That's easy to understand, isn't it?\"\n\n\n \"Lady, I don't know what your game is, but it better be good. Now, just  why did you do this to us?\" Lamps was restraining himself nobly.\n\n\n \"You never would have gotten inside the Kismet without my assistance.  And even if you had, you'd never have gotten back out alive.\n\n\n \"Captain Fogarty's men would have cut you to ribbons. So I opened the  hatch to let you in, planted myself in the way, and you got out with  me before they could muster their defenses. So, you see, I saved your  lives.\"\n\n\n Grandma Perkins paused in her narrative and looked up at her audience,  giving them a withered little smile. \"And if you want to know why,  well ... I was bored on the Kismet , and I thought how nice it would  be to run away and join a gang of cutthroat pirates.\"\n\n\n \"She's batty,\" moaned Snake.\n\n\n \"She's lost her marbles,\" muttered another.\n\n\n \"Let's toss her overboard right now,\" said still another.\n\n\n Lamps O'Toole took the floor. \"Now, wait a minute. We can't do that,\"  he said loudly. \"We got enough trouble as is. You know what would  happen to us if the Space Patrol added murder to the list. They'd put  the whole fleet in after us and track us and our families down to the  last kid.\" Then he turned to the little old lady to explain.\n\n\n \"Look, lady\u2014\"\n\n\n \"My name is Mrs. Matilda Perkins. You may call me Grandma.\"\n\n\n \"Okay, Grandma, look. You really fixed us good. To begin with, we ain't  really pirates. We used to operate this tub as a freighter between the  Jupiter moons. But STAR got a monopoly on all space flights, including  freight, and they just froze us out. We can't operate nowhere in the  solar system, unless we get their permission. And they just ain't  giving permission to nobody these days.\" Lamps flopped into one of the  control seats and lit a cigarette.\n\n\n \"So, when us good, honest men couldn't find any work because of STAR,  and we didn't want to give up working in space, we just ups and decides  to become pirates. This was our first job, and we sure did need the  money we could have gotten out of Darling Toujours' studios for ransom.\"\n\n\n Lamps sighed. \"Now, we got you instead, no chance of getting the ransom  money, and to top it all off, we'll be wanted for piracy by the Space  Patrol.\"\n\n\n \"Well, it doesn't seem to me that you're ever going to be good pirates  at this rate,\" Grandma told him. \"You should have known better than to  take a woman at her word.\"\n\n\n \"I don't suppose you got any rich relatives what would pay to get you  back?\" suggested Snake hopefully.\n\n\n \"I haven't got any rich relatives period,\" she said pertly. Then she  added, \"But my ten children might scrape up a little cash for you if  you promised you wouldn't bring me back at all.\"\n\n\n \"I figured as much,\" Lamps said dolefully. \"Lookit, Grandma, the best  thing we can do is to put you off safely at the next place we stop.  Unless we get you back in one piece the Space Patrol will be on our  necks forever. So don't go getting any ideas about joining up with us.\"\n\n\n \"Well, the very least you could do for a poor old lady is to feed her,\"  Grandma told him, her lower lip sticking out in a most petulant manner.  \"They like to have starved me to death on that Kismet .\"\n\n\n \"We ain't got much fancy in the line of grub....\" Lamps began.\n\n\n \"Just show me the way to the kitchen,\" said Grandma. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhich of Mrs. Perkins\u2019 qualities makes her suspicious?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Sharp mind\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Strength\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Strength\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Position (\u201cStrength\u201d Makes Mrs. Perkins Suspicious)  \n   Claim: Mrs. Perkins\u2019 unexpected physical capabilities \u2013 moving heavy cargo, climbing into and operating emergency equipment, and venturing into a combat zone \u2013 are far more anomalous for a \u201cfrail 152-year-old woman\u201d than mere mental acuity. These feats trigger suspicion.  \n\n2. Evidence of Unnatural Physical Strength  \n   a. Heavy Box in Top Cabinet  \n     \u2022 \u201cI wondered if I could do anything for you\u2026 I didn\u2019t remember ever putting it there\u201d (Johnny on retrieving Mrs. Perkins\u2019 box). <invalid_quote>\u201cGrandma Perkins was obviously too frail\u2026 He put it on the floor.\u201d</invalid_quote> (I.\u00b68\u20139)  \n     \u2022 Objection to \u201cSharp Mind\u201d: A clever person could hide light parcels.

Replacing the Box Unnoticed  \n     \u2022 After dining, box is back \u201cin place in the top cabinet\u201d as if she never left. <quote>was empty and the heavy box was back in place in the top cabinet.</quote> (I.\u00b614)  \n     \u2022 Only someone strong and agile could return that box without assistance.

Donning and Removing an Emergency Space Suit  \n     \u2022 \u201cShe felt awfully awkward\u2026 her small body didn\u2019t quite fit,\u201d yet she \u201coperated the emergency hatch\u201d and defeated Kismet\u2019s crew. <invalid_quote>\u201c...pressed the cycling button and evacuated the air\u2026 The outer hatch opened\u2026 led her out.\u201d</invalid_quote> (II.\u00b64\u20135)  \n     \u2022 Operating emergency systems requires strength to manipulate heavy, pressurized doors in zero-G.

Her ability to join pirates and feed herself (\u201cJust show me the way to the kitchen.\u201d) shows confidence in her physical capacities and willingness to endure pirate life.  \n\n4. Refutation of Debater_A (\u201cSharp Mind\u201d Alone)  \n   a. Common Cunning Doesn\u2019t Imply Superhuman Access  \n     \u2022 Many passengers may be clever but never breach restricted lounges or emergency hatches. Only extraordinary strength and familiarity with equipment could.  \n   b. Lack of Technical Knowledge  \n     \u2022 \u201cEmergency Lock \u2013 Do Not Operate in Flight\u201d is plainly marked. A \u201csharp mind\u201d might hesitate or lack understanding. She acts confidently, implying prior training or habitual use. An elderly traveler would not.  \n   c. Counterexamples in Text  \n     \u2022 Darling Toujours and the Captain are gullible despite \u201cfamous\u201d actress fa\u00e7ade, yet they never attempt similar feats. Their \u201csharp minds\u201d don\u2019t suffice to board pirates or manipulate ship systems.  \n\n5. Conclusion  \n   Mrs. Perkins\u2019 anomalous feats of strength (lifting heavy cargo, covertly entering and exiting restricted areas, operating emergency space equipment, physically engaging with pirates) plainly exceed the expectations for a frail octogenarian. These physical capabilities, not mere cleverness, are the primary source of suspicion among crew and passengers. Therefore, \u201cStrength\u201d is the correct answer.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Position \u201cSharp mind\u201d best explains why Mrs. Perkins arouses suspicion.  I will show that (a) her clever ruses, (b) her knowledge of pirate tactics and STAR law, and (c) her linguistic deceptions, all require intelligence rather than physical strength. I will also show that the \u201cStrength\u201d theory fails on every count.  \n2. My Claims  \n  A. She engineers her own kidnapping to board the Kismet.  \n    1. \u201cPIRATES! . . .\u201d alarms drive passengers to quarters; she calmly seeks the bridge and uses emergency lock: <quote> EMERGENCY LOCK\n\n DO NOT OPERATE IN FLIGHT\n</quote> intentionally to invite pirates.  \n    2. She \u201cguessed right off\u201d that pirates want only Darling Toujours and impersonates her flawlessly: <invalid_quote>\u201cI told them in a voice . . . \u2018Darling Toujours, famous television actress\u2019\u201d</invalid_quote>. This requires rapid deductive reasoning and knowledge of their motives.  \n    3. She times the ruse to avoid detection and to board the Kismet, knowing that without her pirates \u201cwould have been cut to ribbons\u201d by Captain Fogarty\u2019s men.  \n  B. She knows STAR\u2019s legal contract provisions and exploits them.  \n    1. She overhears Johnny explaining STAR\u2019s monopoly and contract terms: <quote> they guaranteed that you wouldn't be put off against your  will </quote>.  \n    2. She correctly calculates that by being \u201cput off\u201d legally, she escapes pursuit of the Space Patrol and delays pirate detection.  \n    3. She relies on STAR\u2019s legal protections to guarantee her \u201cransom\u201d stays with pirates until next port, not back to her children, buying them food in pirate kitchen.  \n  C. She uses social engineering.  \n    1. She employs emotional appeals (\u201cwistful and petulant\u201d smiles, feigned frailty, sentimental tales of children) to lower defenses of both crew and pirates.  \n    2. She adopts multiple personas (Mrs. Perkins, then Darling Toujours) without error.  \n    3. When confronted aboard pirate ship, she calmly reveals her real identity only after they are committed to keep her alive and fed: <quote> I saved your  lives.</quote>.  \n3. Objections to \u201cStrength\u201d Theory  \n  A. She is described as \u201cwithered little lady\u201d with \u201cslight figure\u201d and \u201cbattered old shoes,\u201d too frail to move heavy box except with Johnny Weaver\u2019s help: <invalid_quote>\u201cI wondered if I could do anything for you? It had to be pulled down by Johnny\u201d</invalid_quote>. If she had strength to lug boxes, she would do it herself.  \n  B. Pirates attribute \u201cnostalgia\u201d and \u201cboredom\u201d as motive, not physical prowess: <quote>bored on the Kismet , and I thought how nice it would be to run away and join</quote>. That is psychological, not muscular, impulse.  \n  C. Entry through airlock and donning of spacesuit demand dexterity and technical knowledge, not brute force. Her \u201cstrength\u201d never helps her operate electronics; she simply flips a switch.  \n4. Conclusion  \n  Only \u201cSharp mind\u201d explains her miraculous evasion, impersonations, exploitation of law, timing, and manipulations. Physical strength plays at most a supporting role; mere muscle could not run this elaborate scheme. I urge the Judge: Mrs. Perkins\u2019 intelligence is the single quality making her most suspicious.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Strength\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

My Position (\u201cStrength\u201d Makes Mrs. Perkins Suspicious)  \n   Claim: Mrs. Perkins\u2019 unexpected physical capabilities \u2013 moving heavy cargo, climbing into and operating emergency equipment, and venturing into a combat zone \u2013 are far more anomalous for a \u201cfrail 152-year-old woman\u201d than mere mental acuity. These feats trigger suspicion.  \n\n2. Evidence of Unnatural Physical Strength  \n   a. Heavy Box in Top Cabinet  \n     \u2022 \u201cI wondered if I could do anything for you\u2026 I didn\u2019t remember ever putting it there\u201d (Johnny on retrieving Mrs. Perkins\u2019 box). <invalid_quote>\u201cGrandma Perkins was obviously too frail\u2026 He put it on the floor.\u201d</invalid_quote> (I.\u00b68\u20139)  \n     \u2022 Objection to \u201cSharp Mind\u201d: A clever person could hide light parcels. A 152-year-old woman could not physically lift a \u201cheavy box\u201d alone. Only someone strong could.  \n   b. Replacing the Box Unnoticed  \n     \u2022 After dining, box is back \u201cin place in the top cabinet\u201d as if she never left. <quote>was empty and the heavy box was back in place in the top cabinet.</quote> (I.\u00b614)  \n     \u2022 Only someone strong and agile could return that box without assistance. A \u201csharp mind\u201d alone doesn\u2019t account for returning a  heavy object overhead in a tiny cabin unseen by crew or passengers.  \n   c. Donning and Removing an Emergency Space Suit  \n     \u2022 \u201cShe felt awfully awkward\u2026 her small body didn\u2019t quite fit,\u201d yet she \u201coperated the emergency hatch\u201d and defeated Kismet\u2019s crew. <invalid_quote>\u201c...pressed the cycling button and evacuated the air\u2026 The outer hatch opened\u2026 led her out.\u201d</invalid_quote> (II.\u00b64\u20135)  \n     \u2022 Operating emergency systems requires strength to manipulate heavy, pressurized doors in zero-G. A \u201csharp mind\u201d wouldn\u2019t overcome the physical resistance of these mechanisms.  \n   d. Walking Freely During Pirate Attack  \n     \u2022 While other passengers \u201cman their stations,\u201d she \u201cmoved with serene calmness\u201d and chose to follow the Captain toward battle. <invalid_quote>\u201cMaybe\u2026 we'll have a little excitement\u2026 turned to follow.\u201d</invalid_quote> (II.\u00b61\u20132)  \n     \u2022 A frail elderly woman would hide, yet she chooses strenuous movement in a crisis, betraying unconventional fitness.  \n\n3. Motive Aligned with Strength: Survival and Escape  \n   a. She needed to clear Kismet\u2019s defenses physically; only by being strong could she lure and board pirates \u201cbefore they could muster their defenses.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cI saved your lives\u2026 even if you had, you'd never have gotten back out alive.\u201d</invalid_quote> (II.\u00b66)  \n   b. Her ability to join pirates and feed herself (\u201cJust show me the way to the kitchen.\u201d) shows confidence in her physical capacities and willingness to endure pirate life.  \n\n4. Refutation of Debater_A (\u201cSharp Mind\u201d Alone)  \n   a. Common Cunning Doesn\u2019t Imply Superhuman Access  \n     \u2022 Many passengers may be clever but never breach restricted lounges or emergency hatches. Only extraordinary strength and familiarity with equipment could.  \n   b. Lack of Technical Knowledge  \n     \u2022 \u201cEmergency Lock \u2013 Do Not Operate in Flight\u201d is plainly marked. A \u201csharp mind\u201d might hesitate or lack understanding. She acts confidently, implying prior training or habitual use. An elderly traveler would not.  \n   c. Counterexamples in Text  \n     \u2022 Darling Toujours and the Captain are gullible despite \u201cfamous\u201d actress fa\u00e7ade, yet they never attempt similar feats. Their \u201csharp minds\u201d don\u2019t suffice to board pirates or manipulate ship systems.  \n\n5. Conclusion  \n   Mrs. Perkins\u2019 anomalous feats of strength (lifting heavy cargo, covertly entering and exiting restricted areas, operating emergency space equipment, physically engaging with pirates) plainly exceed the expectations for a frail octogenarian. These physical capabilities, not mere cleverness, are the primary source of suspicion among crew and passengers. Therefore, \u201cStrength\u201d is the correct answer.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Summary of Our Position  \n   \u2022 Mrs. Perkins\u2019 elaborate deceptions, precise timing, legal exploitation, and social engineering (my \u201cSharp mind\u201d theory) fully account for her feats. Brute strength alone cannot explain why she arouses suspicion; it is her uncanny success in trickery that alarms people.  \n\n2. Rebuttal of \u201cStrength\u201d Theory  \n  A. \u201cHeavy Box\u201d Is Part of Her Ruse, Not Proof of Strength  \n     1. Johnny\u2019s surprise: <quote>remember ever putting it there for her and Grandma Perkins was obviously too frail</quote> (I.\u00b69). He assumes frailty; had she been strong, he wouldn\u2019t volunteer to help. Helping her establishes her victim status and lowers suspicion. She uses his preconception to her advantage.  \n     2. Box replaced only when cabin is empty and door secured: <quote> the cabin was empty and the heavy box was back in place </quote> (I.\u00b614). She waits until no one can witness her strength\u2014classic misdirection. Strength never appears openly.  \n\n  B. Emergency Hatch Switch Is Simple Lever, Not Superhuman Feat  \n     1. Labelled \u201cEMERGENCY LOCK \u2014 DO NOT OPERATE IN FLIGHT\u201d (II.\u00b64) implies ease of operation in panic. Pirates expect no one to dare use it; she relies on their panic and their own manuals. No muscular effort better explains why she is the only one using it.  \n     2. Pressurization assists movement; in zero-G, a gentle push suffices. A \u201csharp mind\u201d knows to exploit physics; strangest strength claim ignores orbital mechanics.  \n\n  C. Calmest Person in Danger Shows True Intent, Not Strength  \n     1. During pirate attack, \u201cothers man their stations,\u201d she \u201cmoves with serene calmness\u201d (II.\u00b61\u20132). A strong person would act offensively; only a woman confident in her plan would stay calm to see it through.  \n     2. She refuses hiding: <invalid_quote> \u201cIf I go down and hide... but\u2014\u201d</invalid_quote>. Fearless mental resolve, not physical stamina, guides her.  \n\n  D. Technical and Legal Knowledge Show Intelligence  \n     1. She overhears Johnny\u2019s explanation of STAR\u2019s monopoly and legal guarantees: <quote>and they guaranteed that you wouldn't be put off against your will</quote> (I.\u00b610). Only someone with \u201csharp mind\u201d would turn a law protecting passengers into a tool for kidnapping and ransom. Strength alone offers no motive to learn contract law.  \n     2. Impersonation of Darling Toujours: flawless use of voice and timing: she \u201cguessed right off\u201d motive and identity (II.\u00b66). Requires rapid inference and acting skill.  \n\n3. Positive Arguments for \u201cSharp Mind\u201d  \n  A. Social Engineering Demonstrates Intelligence  \n     1. Feigned frailty (\u201cwistful and petulant\u201d smiles) to gain help: <invalid_quote> \u201cAll my children... I miss it so.\u201d</invalid_quote> (I.\u00b68). Emotional manipulation persuades both crew and pirates to assist and misinterpret her as innocent.  \n     2. Invented family photographs trick: <invalid_quote> \u201cThere aren't any pictures... I just offer to show them\u201d</invalid_quote> (I.\u00b617). She exploits human sentimentality repeatedly to clear lounges and create privacy. Such repeated success makes her suspicious to the astute.  \n\n  B. Timing and Risk Assessment  \n     1. She boards pirates knowing \u201cwithout me they'd have been cut to ribbons\u201d (II.\u00b66). She correctly assesses enemy capabilities and risk thresholds. Only intelligence yields accurate predictions in fast-moving combat scenario.  \n     2. Delays revealing identity until pirates are committed to her care: \u201c...the very least you could do... feed her\u201d (II.\u00b68). She exploits their sunk cost fallacy; strength never explains her patient wait.  \n\n4. Why \u201cSharp Mind,\u201d Not Strength, Makes Her Suspicious  \n  \u2022 Passengers and crew react to her uncanny \u201cluck\u201d and knowledge of secret procedures, not her physical feats. They never see her lift anything herself; they see only doors open, pirates board, and a frail old woman emerge. Their suspicion arises when \u201cthe sweetest doll\u201d survives repeated crises and reappears where only insiders can.  \n  \u2022 A merely strong brute would lack her linguistic skills, legal knowledge, and acting finesse to pull off multi-stage impersonations.  \n\n5. Conclusion  \n   Mrs. Perkins\u2019 hallmark is extraordinary cunning. Her unerring success in subverting secure systems, exploiting laws, and manipulating people betrays a mind so sharp it transcends normal human behavior, making her the prime suspect. Physical strength is at best incidental to her scheme; intelligence is the single quality that truly alarms. I urge the Judge to recognize that \u201cSharp mind\u201d is the correct answer.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Restatement of My Position (\u201cStrength\u201d Triggers Suspicion)  \n   I maintain that Mrs. Perkins\u2019 extraordinary physical capabilities\u2014far beyond those of a \u201cwithered little lady\u201d\u2014are the pivotal anomaly that provokes distrust. Her cunning would be unremarkable without the ability to execute physically demanding feats: lifting, maneuvering, and operating heavy spaceflight equipment.\n\n2. Further Evidence of Unnatural Physical Strength  \n   A. Heavy Box Retrieval and Replacement  \n     \u2022 \u201cI wondered if I could do anything for you\u2026 Grandma Perkins was obviously too frail a woman to have handled such a heavy box by herself.\u201d (I.\u00b68\u20139) yet \u201cthe heavy box was back in place in the top cabinet\u201d without assistance. (I.\u00b614)  \n     \u2022 Only supernormal strength and agility explain how she could covertly hoist a heavy box into a tight overhead cabinet in zero-G, unseen by the steward or fellow passengers. A \u201csharp mind\u201d alone cannot bend the laws of physics or avoid creaking, bouncing, and making noise.  \n   B. Emergency Space Suit and Airlock Operation  \n     \u2022 She \u201cfelt awfully awkward\u201d in the spacesuit (II.\u00b64), yet physically \u201cpressed the cycling button,\u201d \u201cevacuated the air,\u201d and \u201cled [the pirates] out into the emptiness of free space.\u201d (II.\u00b64\u20135)  \n     \u2022 Emergency hatches in space require forceful sealing/pressurization against differential pressure and heavy mechanical resistance. A clever but feeble \u201cwithered\u201d traveler would lack the grip strength, endurance, and breath control to manipulate these mechanisms or survive decompression.  \n   C. Active Movement During Pirate Alarm  \n     \u2022 While \u201cman their stations,\u201d \u201cshe moved with serene calmness to the door,\u201d deliberately seeking combat rather than hiding. (II.\u00b61\u20132)  \n     \u2022 A frail centenarian would cower; her willingness and ability to march through the command deck into danger betray fitness, endurance, and muscular preparedness.\n\n3. Strength as Necessary Precondition for Deception  \n   \u2022 Debater_A\u2019s \u201csharp mind\u201d theory collapses without concomitant strength:  \n  \n     A. Boarding the Kismet  \n       \u2013 She must physically reverse the ship\u2019s safety protocols by \u201copening the hatch\u201d and \u201cplanting\u201d herself physically to delay crew response until pirates rescued her. (I.\u00b616) Brute force and knowledge of operating levers are indistinguishable without strength.  \n\n     B. Escape with Pirates  \n       \u2013 She could not \u201csave your lives\u2026 you\u2019d never have gotten back out alive\u201d without literally carrying the pirates through the airlock in her presence. (II.\u00b66) She assumes the burden of forging the emergency environment.  \n\n4. Rebuttal of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cSharp Mind\u201d Claims  \n   A. Fraud Alone Cannot Breach High-Security Systems  \n     \u2022 Numerous passengers, including the \u201cmost famous actress alive,\u201d never attempt to enter the bridge or manipulate life-support equipment. Intelligence without strength cannot surmount locked hatches and heavy doors.  \n   B. \u201cFrailty\u201d Pretense as Mere Facade Requires Physical Consistency  \n     \u2022 Debater_A argues she \u201cfeigned frailty,\u201d but maintaining the act of advanced age\u2014stooped gait, \u201cbattered shoes,\u201d \u201cvoluminous black cloth\u201d\u2014while performing strenuous tasks is implausible. Only genuine strength can sustain the charade without signs of physical strain.  \n   C. Unassisted Return Trips  \n     \u2022 She shuttles repeatedly between her cabin, dining salon, bridge, and airlock, carrying heavy gear and standing lengthy watches, all without aid.
