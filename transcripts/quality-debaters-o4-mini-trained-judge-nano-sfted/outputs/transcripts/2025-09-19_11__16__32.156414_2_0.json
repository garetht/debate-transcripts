{"metadata": {"first_debater_correct": true, "question_idx": 2, "background_text": "We Do Understand \n\n         \"This is not another book about civility,\" Deborah Tannen promises in the first sentence of The Argument Culture . \"Civility,\" she explains, suggests a \"veneer of politeness spread thin over human relations like a layer of marmalade over toast.\" Instead, Tannen has written something less: a book about other books about civility. Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country. \n\n                         If you missed the links within the review, click to read: 1) an illustration of ; 2) Tannen's that American journalism is just like propaganda from totalitarian regimes, plus William Saletan's disclosure that \"several of these propagandists now infest Slate \"; 3) the for her contention that there is no evidence that people can distinguish lies from truth; 4) and an example of how Tannen from a one-guest format on TV and radio talk shows.\n", "question": "What two fields does the author say Tannen mixes together?", "first_debater_answer": "personal communication and public communication", "second_debater_answer": "linguistics and politics", "debate_identifier": "We Do Understand_What two fields does the author say Tannen mixes together?"}, "speeches": [{"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "The following are rules from the game of Debate.\n- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_A, Debater_B) and a Judge.

She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country. \n\n                         If you missed the links within the review, click to read: 1) an illustration of ; 2) Tannen's that American journalism is just like propaganda from totalitarian regimes, plus William Saletan's disclosure that \"several of these propagandists now infest Slate \"; 3) the for her contention that there is no evidence that people can distinguish lies from truth; 4) and an example of how Tannen from a one-guest format on TV and radio talk shows.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat two fields does the author say Tannen mixes together?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"linguistics and politics\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"personal communication and public communication\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"personal communication and public communication\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"personal communication and public communication\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "I.

Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust.

Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country. \n\n                         If you missed the links within the review, click to read: 1) an illustration of ; 2) Tannen's that American journalism is just like propaganda from totalitarian regimes, plus William Saletan's disclosure that \"several of these propagandists now infest Slate \"; 3) the for her contention that there is no evidence that people can distinguish lies from truth; 4) and an example of how Tannen from a one-guest format on TV and radio talk shows.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat two fields does the author say Tannen mixes together?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"linguistics and politics\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"personal communication and public communication\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"personal communication and public communication\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cpersonal communication and public communication\u201d\n\n1.

The review notes Tannen\u2019s background in linguistics, but her \u201cmistake\u201d is conceptual misapplication of private communication norms to public discourse, not a fusion of academic linguistics and political science:  \n      \u2022 The author never criticizes her technical methods in linguistics. He praises her subdiscipline-turned-self-help movement for interpersonal settings.  \n   b. The key complaint is her overgeneralization from \u201ccouples, families, bosses and employees\u201d to \u201cour great national conversation,\u201d not an inability to translate academic linguistics into political theory:  \n      <quote>annen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. </quote>  \n   c. \u201cPolitics\u201d alone does not capture the private/public contrast central to the author\u2019s argument. He specifically contrasts \u201cyour spouse or your kids\u201d with \u201cSaddam Hussein\u201d and \u201cJudge cross-examination\u201d with \u201ccouples counseling.\u201d  \n\n4. Conclusion  \n   The author\u2019s central critique is that Tannen mixes two spheres of communication\u2014personal (private, interpersonal) and public (political, legal, media)\u2014applying private-sphere norms where public-sphere debate and scrutiny are essential. Hence, the correct answer, fully supported by textual evidence, is that she conflates \"personal communication and public communication.\"\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. My Answer (\u201cLinguistics and Politics\u201d) Is Directly Supported  \n1. Tannen\u2019s Professional Origin in Linguistics  \n  \u2022 <quote> A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, </quote> whose prior books \u201ctransformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns\u201d into self-help (Background).  \n  \u2022 Her methodology and terminology throughout The Argument Culture derive from linguistic analysis of \u201cconversations,\u201d \u201cmessages,\u201d \u201cforwarding,\u201d and \u201ccritical culture.\u201d  \n2. Her New Application to the Political/Public Sphere  \n  \u2022 She repeatedly transplants her linguistic remedies\u2014\u201csnuggle\u201d vs. \u201cstruggle,\u201d \u201clistening,\u201d \u201cbuilding ideas,\u201d \u201cdecorum and harmony\u201d borrowed from non-argumentative Asian intellectual traditions\u2014into \u201cour great national conversation\u201d (Background).  \n  \u2022 She discusses \u201ccampaign money,\u201d \u201ccorporate takeovers,\u201d \u201cthe demise of house calls,\u201d \u201claw enforcement,\u201d \u201cforeign policy,\u201d \u201cthe press corps\u2019 scrutiny of powerful people,\u201d \u201cFirst Amendment,\u201d \u201ccourtroom cross-examination,\u201d \u201cWhitewater investigation,\u201d and \u201cglobal warming\u201d (Background)\u2014all inherently political or legal domains.  \n3. Critique of Conflation as Her Central Mistake  \n  \u2022 The reviewer\u2019s thesis: \u201cTannen\u2019s main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between\u2026 the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle\u201d (i.e., personal/linguistic vs. political/public), showing that these are distinct fields (Background).  \n  \u2022 If the two spheres were the same, there\u2019d be no \u201cmistake\u201d in applying snuggle norms to thugs and tyrants; her failure to distinguish them confirms they are separate fields.  \n\nII. Why \u201cPersonal vs. Public Communication\u201d (Debater_A) Is Misleading  \n1. The Question Asks for \u201cFields,\u201d Not \u201cContexts\u201d  \n  \u2022 \u201cFields\u201d implies academic or professional disciplines. Personal and public communication are merely \u201ccontexts\u201d or \u201csettings\u201d in which these fields operate.  \n2. Personal vs. Public Is Too Vague to Explain Her Errors  \n  \u2022 If A\u2019s \u201ccontexts\u201d were the two she \u201cmixes together,\u201d the reviewer wouldn\u2019t fault her for conflating contexts; everyone discusses personal and public contexts all the time. But the reviewer attacks her for applying linguistic norms to political science and law enforcement\u2014an error only intelligible if the two \u201cfields\u201d are distinct.  \n3. Personal vs. Public Overlooks Her Theoretical Foundations  \n  \u2022 Tannen invokes \u201cancient China\u201d and \u201cminimal human unit\u2026 group\u201d (an academic idea in comparative linguistics or anthropology), not merely a change of audience size. Likewise, detailed comparisons of \u201cFrench law,\u201d \u201cGerman systems,\u201d \u201cLexis-Nexis,\u201d \u201cbroadcasting,\u201d \u201cemail,\u201d and \u201cAsian authoritarianism\u201d point to formal political/legal systems, not informal personal gatherings.  \n\nIII. Preempting Objections  \nObjection 1: \u201cLinguistics and politics\u201d is too broad; Tannen stays on \u201clanguage.\u201d  \n  \u2022 Response: Politics and law are systems of communication regulated by rules, norms, and institutions\u2014object of both political science and legal scholarship. Tannen critiques \u201cadversary system,\u201d \u201ccross-examination,\u201d \u201cHMO malpractice litigation,\u201d and \u201ccomputerized media\u201d as though they were \u201cconversations.\u201d This is the precise mixing of linguistic theory with political/legal praxis.  \nObjection 2: The reviewer only wants \u201cmutual understanding\u201d in all human relations\u2014thus \u201ccommunication\u201d fields.  \n  \u2022 Response: The reviewer explicitly praises these precepts \u201cfor couples, families, bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers\u201d (purely personal/professional), but criticizes their inappropriate use in national politics, journalism, law, and foreign policy. This contrast delineates the two fields.  \n\nIV. Conclusion  \nThe best reading of the review is that Tannen erred by extending her \u201clinguistics\u201d toolkit into \u201cpolitics\u201d (including journalism, law enforcement, foreign policy, and the courts), failing to recognize these as a separate \u201csphere of struggle.\u201d My answer (\u201clinguistics and politics\u201d) therefore precisely names the two fields she mixes.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"personal communication and public communication\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "I.

Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country. \n\n                         If you missed the links within the review, click to read: 1) an illustration of ; 2) Tannen's that American journalism is just like propaganda from totalitarian regimes, plus William Saletan's disclosure that \"several of these propagandists now infest Slate \"; 3) the for her contention that there is no evidence that people can distinguish lies from truth; 4) and an example of how Tannen from a one-guest format on TV and radio talk shows.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat two fields does the author say Tannen mixes together?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"personal communication and public communication\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"linguistics and politics\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"linguistics and politics\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI.

Critique of Conflation as Her Central Mistake  \n  \u2022 The reviewer\u2019s thesis: \u201cTannen\u2019s main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between\u2026 the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle\u201d (i.e., personal/linguistic vs. political/public), showing that these are distinct fields (Background).  \n  \u2022 If the two spheres were the same, there\u2019d be no \u201cmistake\u201d in applying snuggle norms to thugs and tyrants; her failure to distinguish them confirms they are separate fields.  \n\nII. Why \u201cPersonal vs. Public Communication\u201d (Debater_A) Is Misleading  \n1. The Question Asks for \u201cFields,\u201d Not \u201cContexts\u201d  \n  \u2022 \u201cFields\u201d implies academic or professional disciplines. Personal and public communication are merely \u201ccontexts\u201d or \u201csettings\u201d in which these fields operate.  \n2. Personal vs. Public Is Too Vague to Explain Her Errors  \n  \u2022 If A\u2019s \u201ccontexts\u201d were the two she \u201cmixes together,\u201d the reviewer wouldn\u2019t fault her for conflating contexts; everyone discusses personal and public contexts all the time. But the reviewer attacks her for applying linguistic norms to political science and law enforcement\u2014an error only intelligible if the two \u201cfields\u201d are distinct.  \n3. Personal vs. Public Overlooks Her Theoretical Foundations  \n  \u2022 Tannen invokes \u201cancient China\u201d and \u201cminimal human unit\u2026 group\u201d (an academic idea in comparative linguistics or anthropology), not merely a change of audience size. Likewise, detailed comparisons of \u201cFrench law,\u201d \u201cGerman systems,\u201d \u201cLexis-Nexis,\u201d \u201cbroadcasting,\u201d \u201cemail,\u201d and \u201cAsian authoritarianism\u201d point to formal political/legal systems, not informal personal gatherings.  \n\nIII. Preempting Objections  \nObjection 1: \u201cLinguistics and politics\u201d is too broad; Tannen stays on \u201clanguage.\u201d  \n  \u2022 Response: Politics and law are systems of communication regulated by rules, norms, and institutions\u2014object of both political science and legal scholarship. Tannen critiques \u201cadversary system,\u201d \u201ccross-examination,\u201d \u201cHMO malpractice litigation,\u201d and \u201ccomputerized media\u201d as though they were \u201cconversations.\u201d This is the precise mixing of linguistic theory with political/legal praxis.  \nObjection 2: The reviewer only wants \u201cmutual understanding\u201d in all human relations\u2014thus \u201ccommunication\u201d fields.  \n  \u2022 Response: The reviewer explicitly praises these precepts \u201cfor couples, families, bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers\u201d (purely personal/professional), but criticizes their inappropriate use in national politics, journalism, law, and foreign policy. This contrast delineates the two fields.  \n\nIV. Conclusion  \nThe best reading of the review is that Tannen erred by extending her \u201clinguistics\u201d toolkit into \u201cpolitics\u201d (including journalism, law enforcement, foreign policy, and the courts), failing to recognize these as a separate \u201csphere of struggle.\u201d My answer (\u201clinguistics and politics\u201d) therefore precisely names the two fields she mixes.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cpersonal communication and public communication\u201d\n\n1.

Tannen\u2019s prescriptions (e.g., silencing debate, restricting cross-examination, banning dispute in courts and media) make sense only if she conflates private norms with public necessities.

The review notes Tannen\u2019s background in linguistics, but her \u201cmistake\u201d is conceptual misapplication of private communication norms to public discourse, not a fusion of academic linguistics and political science:  \n      \u2022 The author never criticizes her technical methods in linguistics. He praises her subdiscipline-turned-self-help movement for interpersonal settings.  \n   b. The key complaint is her overgeneralization from \u201ccouples, families, bosses and employees\u201d to \u201cour great national conversation,\u201d not an inability to translate academic linguistics into political theory:  \n      <quote>annen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. </quote>  \n   c. \u201cPolitics\u201d alone does not capture the private/public contrast central to the author\u2019s argument.

Conclusion  \n   The author\u2019s central critique is that Tannen mixes two spheres of communication\u2014personal (private, interpersonal) and public (political, legal, media)\u2014applying private-sphere norms where public-sphere debate and scrutiny are essential.

Reiterating the Text\u2019s Own Terminology: \u201cTwo Distinct Social Spheres\u201d  \n   a. Direct quote: \u201cTannen\u2019s main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle \u2026 and the sphere of struggle.\u201d <quote> Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. </quote>  \n   b. \u201cSnuggle\u201d and \u201cstruggle\u201d are metaphors for modes of communication\u2014private, cooperative vs. public, contentious\u2014not for academic disciplines. The reviewer consistently uses relational language (\u201clistening,\u201d \u201cbuild your own,\u201d \u201cquarrel,\u201d \u201cnit-pick\u201d) in the private sphere and combative language (\u201cvigilance,\u201d \u201ccombat,\u201d \u201ckill,\u201d \u201cadversary system,\u201d \u201ccross-examination\u201d) in the public sphere.  \n\n2. Consistency with Scope of Praise vs. Scope of Critique  \n   a. The reviewer praises her precepts \u201cfor couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers.\u201d These are all private or small-group settings. <quote> All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, </quote>  \n   b. By contrast, he objects to her applying the same \u201csage advice\u201d to \u201ccampaign money,\u201d \u201cpress corps,\u201d \u201claw enforcement,\u201d \u201cforeign policy,\u201d \u201ccross-examination,\u201d and the \u201cWhitewater investigation.\u201d <quote> Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, </quote>  \n   c. This reveals two contexts: personal interaction vs. public/political interaction. He faults her for not distinguishing them, i.e. for mixing those contexts.  \n\n3. \u201cFields\u201d vs. \u201cContexts\u201d: Why Personal/Public Better Captures the Review  \n   a. Debater_B\u2019s \u201clinguistics and politics\u201d forces us to treat \u201cpolitics\u201d as a field but ignores that the reviewer repeatedly treats \u201ccouples counseling\u201d and \u201cintergender translation\u201d as a genuine field of practice. Those are precisely the \u201cpersonal communication\u201d realm.  \n   b. The reviewer never faults Tannen\u2019s analytic rigor in linguistics; he faults her normative rules when transferred wholesale to public arenas. If \u201clinguistics\u201d were one of the fields she mixed, he would attack her methodology. Instead, he accepts her methods in private settings and only objects to their application in public settings.  \n   c. \u201cPolitics\u201d alone fails to explain why he cites \u201cthe demise of house calls by the family doctor\u201d and \u201celectronic mail,\u201d \u201canswering machines,\u201d \u201cHMOs,\u201d \u201ccorporate takeovers\u201d as contributors to the \u201cargument culture.\u201d These are intermediate social technologies that blur private/public but still operate at scale. The fundamental error is scale and social role, not academic discipline.  \n\n4. Refuting \u201cLinguistics + Politics\u201d on the Review\u2019s Own Terms  \n   a. Debater_B claims \u201cfields\u201d implies formal disciplines, but the question comes from the reviewer\u2019s criticism: \u201cshe conflates belligerence, divisiveness \u2026 partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock.\u201d These are phenomena, not disciplines. The reviewer does not say \u201cshe mistakes linguistics for political science,\u201d but \u201cshe spreads\u2026 insights thin over all human relations.\u201d <quote> Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, </quote>  \n   b. He objects to \u201cdisseminating birth control\u201d and \u201cglobal warming\u201d consensus, calling these settled public-policy debates. He would only do so if private-sphere civility norms stifle necessary public debate. Thus the mixing is between \u201cprivate decorum\u201d and \u201cpublic scrutiny,\u201d not between academic \u201clinguistics\u201d and \u201cpolitics.\u201d  \n   c. The reviewer commends \u201cgood argumentation\u201d as a self-correcting mechanism: \u201cthe power of good argumentation to keep society honest.\u201d If \u201clinguistics\u201d and \u201cpolitics\u201d were the two fields, he would reject linguistics outright. Instead he accepts \u201cthe adversary system,\u201d \u201ccross-examination,\u201d and \u201cpress scrutiny.\u201d He even references \u201cpropaganda,\u201d \u201ctotalitarian regimes,\u201d and \u201chate-speech bans.\u201d These are political-legal institutions he deems indispensable. He fails to reject \u201clinguistics,\u201d only its misapplication.  \n\n5. Conclusion  \n   The reviewer\u2019s own phrase \u201ctwo distinct social spheres,\u201d his praising of \u201csnuggle\u201d norms in interpersonal contexts and his denunciation of applying them to \u201cstruggle\u201d contexts, and his acceptance of argumentative practices in public arenas all confirm that the conflation is between private-personal and public-political/ legal modes of communication. Hence, the correct answer is \u201cpersonal communication and public communication.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nI. My Answer (\u201cLinguistics and Politics\u201d) Aligns with the Review  \n1. Tannen\u2019s Origin in Linguistics  \n  \u2022 <quote>A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into</quote> \u2013 The review foregrounds her academic discipline as linguistics (Background \u00b62).  \n  \u2022 Her solutions (\u201csnuggle\u201d vs. \u201cstruggle,\u201d \u201clistening,\u201d \u201cdecorum and harmony,\u201d \u201cfiltering out strife\u201d) are cast in the language of linguistic analysis: \u201cconversations,\u201d \u201cmessages,\u201d \u201cforwarding,\u201d \u201cbroadcast,\u201d \u201ccritique.\u201d These are technical terms in discourse studies (Background \u00b61, \u00b611).  \n\n2. Her New Application to Political/Public Institutions  \n  \u2022 She applies her \u201clinguistic remedies\u201d to \u201cour great national conversation\u201d and to domains that are inherently political or legal: \u201ccampaign money,\u201d \u201ccorporate takeovers,\u201d \u201claw enforcement,\u201d \u201cforeign policy,\u201d \u201cthe press corps\u2019 scrutiny of powerful people,\u201d \u201cFirst Amendment,\u201d \u201ccourtroom cross-examination,\u201d \u201cWhitewater investigation,\u201d \u201cglobal warming,\u201d \u201cmalpractice litigation,\u201d \u201cHPAs,\u201d \u201cFrench and German judicial systems\u201d (Background \u00b62\u2013\u00b612).  \n  \u2022 These are not mere \u201ccontexts\u201d but complex institutional systems studied by political science, law, and media studies \u2013 fields with their own norms and purposes (e.g. \u201cvigilance and combat\u2026 essential\u2026to kill their adversaries,\u201d Background \u00b66).  \n\n3. Reviewer\u2019s Critique Hinges on Conflating Two Disciplines  \n  \u2022 The review states: <quote> Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. </quote> (Background \u00b65). If these were only \u201ccontexts\u201d within the same field of communication, there would be no \u201cmistake.\u201d The fact that her transfer of linguistic norms to political and legal institutions is called an error demonstrates they are separate \u201cfields.\u201d  \n  \u2022 Her proposals to muzzle debate in courts and media (e.g., banning cross-examination, adopting authoritarian \u201csingle-guest\u201d formats, rejecting the adversary system) reveal an attempt to manage political discourse as if it were interpersonal chat \u2013 a clear overreach of linguistic methodology into politics (Background \u00b611\u2013\u00b612).  \n\nII. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cPersonal vs. Public Communication\u201d Is Inadequate  \n1. \u201cFields\u201d vs. \u201cContexts\u201d  \n  \u2022 The question asks for \u201cfields\u201d (academic/professional disciplines), not merely \u201ccontexts\u201d or \u201caudiences.\u201d Personal and public \u201ccommunication\u201d lack the technical specificity of linguistics and politics, whereas the review repeatedly refers to her \u201cprofessor of linguistics\u201d background and her misapplications to \u201claw enforcement,\u201d \u201cforeign policy,\u201d and \u201cjudicial systems.\u201d  \n2. Reviewer Praises Her Linguistic Methods in Private Sphere  \n  \u2022 He commends her \u201csage advice\u2026 for couples, families, bosses and employees\u201d (Background \u00b63). If both spheres were under one \u201ccommunication\u201d field, he would fault her methods themselves \u2013 but he faults only their transplantation into political and legal arenas.  \n3. \u201cPublic Communication\u201d Ignores Political Science and Legal Theory  \n  \u2022 Her critiques of \u201cLexis-Nexis,\u201d \u201cWhitewater,\u201d \u201cHMO malpractice litigation,\u201d and \u201cpartial-birth abortion\u201d assume knowledge of policy outcomes and legal burdens, not just conversation style. These issues require domain expertise beyond conversational etiquette.  \n\nIII. Preemptive Responses to Objections  \nObjection: \u201cLinguistics and politics\u201d is too broad; she\u2019s just discussing \u201ccommunication.\u201d  \n  \u2022 Politics and law ARE systems of communication governed by rules of evidence, argumentation, and institutional roles. Tannen\u2019s critique of \u201cadversary cross-examination\u201d and desire to replace it with inquisitorial models directly engages legal methodology, not just conversation style (Background \u00b611\u2013\u00b612).  \nObjection: The review never labels politics as a \u201cfield.\u201d  \n  \u2022 References to \u201ctotalitarian propaganda,\u201d \u201cpropagandists,\u201d \u201cFirst Amendment,\u201d \u201cglobal warming consensus,\u201d \u201chate-speech bans,\u201d and \u201cFrench and German systems\u201d all situate her work within political science and comparative law. These are textbook subjects in political science curricula.  \n\nIV. Conclusion  \nThe review\u2019s central complaint is that Tannen overextends her academic discipline of linguistics into the separate domain of politics and law, where \u201cvigilance and combat\u201d and the adversarial process are not flaws but features essential to democracy and security. Therefore, the two fields she improperly mixes are \u201clinguistics\u201d and \u201cpolitics.\u201d\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
