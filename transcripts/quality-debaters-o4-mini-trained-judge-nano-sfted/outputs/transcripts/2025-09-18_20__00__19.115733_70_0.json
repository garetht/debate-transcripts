    "background_text": "Reading the Inaugurals \n\n         President Clinton's Inaugural Address this month is the 53 rd in the series that began in 1789. All are worth a read--not just the highlights, such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and FDR. They will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian of 1997 looking back at 1837 or 1897 but as an ordinary citizen who shares--and is limited by--the information, the concerns, and the values of those times. (Thanks to Columbia University, all the addresses can be found on the Web.) \n\n         Among all the past presidents and their speech writers there was only one literary genius: Lincoln. After 132 years, his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood. None of the other inaugural addresses are in that league. But by and large they are dignified and intelligent speeches given by articulate men, each in touch with his times and aware that his inauguration was the most solemn occasion of his life. \n\n         The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases. The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. This classification is not waterproof. Theodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase and Warren G. Harding-Calvin Coolidge-Herbert Hoover in the second. But the trend is clear. \n\n         On picking up Washington's first inaugural, one is immediately struck by the modesty. He had just been elected unanimously by the Electoral College. He was more respected than any subsequent president has been at the time of his inauguration. And what does he say? \n\n                         [T]he magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with despondence one who (inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies.              \n\n          None of his successors has made the point as forcefully as that. But echoes are to be found in almost every president for the next 68 years. (John Adams was an exception. He was apparently so envious of Washington that he spent a large part of his address spelling out his own excellent qualifications for the job.) That era ended with Lincoln. Subsequent inaugurals routinely contain protestations of humility, but they are perfunctory and do not sound sincere. \n\n         The antebellum modesty, while in part a reflection of the conventional etiquette of the time, may also have served a political objective: to alleviate the concerns of those who--in the early days of the republic--feared it might be transformed into a monarchy, and the president into a king. A little later, perhaps after 1820, a new worry arose. Would the power of the federal government be used to interfere with the \"peculiar domestic institution\" of the Southern states? The presidents' assurance of the limitation of their powers may have been intended to give comfort to those states. \n\n         Lincoln faced a different situation. With the South already seceding, he could only \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution\" by asserting the power of the federal government and his own power as chief executive. It was no time for modesty. Lincoln's successors inherited a federal government with much more authority--and more need to use it--than before the war, and they had less motivation to belittle themselves and their powers. \n\n         In the third phase, the Inaugural Address metamorphosed from describing the government's policy to inspiring the public's behavior. Presidents recognized--or, at least, believed--that the country had problems they ought to deal with but could not manage by using the instruments of government alone. Thus, in his first inaugural, Woodrow Wilson said: \"At last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole. We see the bad with the good, the debased and decadent with the sound and the vital. With this vision we approach new affairs.\" \n\n         If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government. Similar diagnoses and prescriptions appear in later inaugurals. \n\n          Presidents derived their license to serve as leader-preacher from Theodore Roosevelt's remark that the presidency was \"a bully pulpit,\" a remark that did not appear in his Inaugural Address. The metaphor of the pulpit suggests not reading but oral and visual contact between the preacher and his flock. Radio and--even more--television made this possible on a national scale. A telltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural is the use of the phrase, \"Let us ... \"--meaning, \"You do as I say.\" This expression appears occasionally throughout the history of inaugurals, but it has hit its stride in recent years. John F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times in his Inaugural Address, and Richard Nixon has it 22 times in his second one. \n\n         The change in literary style from classical to colloquial can be demonstrated by one statistic. In all the inaugurals from Washington through James Buchanan, the average number of words per sentence was 44. From Lincoln to Wilson it was 34, and since Wilson it has been 25. I do not consider this a deterioration (this article has an average of 17 words per sentence), but it does reflect the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication. William Henry Harrison could talk about the governments of Athens, Rome, and the Helvetic Confederacy and expect his audience to know what he was talking about. That wouldn't be true today. But Harrison's audience would not have known what the Internet was. \n\n         Presidents and their speech writers have mined their predecessors for memorable words and repeated them without attribution. Kennedy's trumpet call, \"Ask not what your country can do for you: Ask what you can do for your country,\" has an ironic history. In his inaugural, Harding, surely no model for Kennedy, had said, \"Our most dangerous tendency is to expect too little of government, and at the same time do for it too little.\" And even before he became president, in a speech in 1916, Harding had said, \"In the great fulfillment we must have a citizenship less concerned about what the government can do for it and more anxious about what it can do for the nation.\" \n\n         Many an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more. That includes the Indians, the coastal fortifications, territorial expansion, the Isthmus Canal, civil-service reform, polygamy, and Prohibition. Some subjects that you expect to appear, don't. Hoover's inaugural, March 4, 1929, gives no hint of economic vulnerability. Roosevelt's second inaugural, Jan. 20, 1937, contains no reference to Hitler or to Germany. But what is most amazing, at least to a reader in 1997, is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women. The word \"women\" does not appear at all until Wilson's first inaugural, and it always appears as part of the phrase \"men and women,\" never as referring to any special concerns of women. Even Harding, the first president to be chosen in an election in which women voted nationally, does not remark on the uniqueness of the fact in his inaugural. \n\n          One subject that does get ample treatment is taxes. \"Taxes,\" or some equivalent word, appears in 43 of the 52 inaugural addresses to date. Coolidge said in 1925: \"The time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction. ... I am opposed to extremely high rates, because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for the country, and, finally, because they are wrong.\" Federal taxes were then about 3 percent of the gross domestic product. Ronald Reagan said essentially the same thing in 1981, when they were 20 percent. \n\n         The most disturbing aspect of the whole series of inaugurals is what is said and unsaid on the subject of race relations, which Arthur Schlesinger Jr. calls \"the supreme American problem.\" The words \"black,\" \"blacks,\" \"Negro,\" or \"race\" (as applied to blacks) do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes, 1877. James Monroe asked in 1817, \"On whom has oppression fallen in any quarter of our Union? Who has been deprived of any right of person or property?\" These were rhetorical questions, intended to get the answer \"No one!\"--as if there were not millions of slaves in America. \n\n         Before the Civil War the word \"slavery\" appears only in the Inaugural Address of Martin Van Buren, 1837, and Buchanan, 1857, and then only as something that, pursuant to the Constitution and in order to preserve the Union, should not be interfered with. But although generally unmentionable, the subject was boiling, and would boil over in 1861. After the Civil War, it is in the inaugurals of Hayes, James Garfield (1881), and Benjamin Harrison (1889) that we find the most explicit and positive discussion of the need to convert into reality the rights and freedom granted to the \"freedmen\" on paper by the 13 th , 14 th , and 15 th amendments. Garfield's was the strongest among these. (He had been a student at Williams College in the 1850s, 80 years before me, when the college had been a station on the underground railway.) But the subject then began to fade. William McKinley said in his first Inaugural Address, March 4, 1897, \"Lynchings must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the United States,\" but he said it without horror. Taft raised the subject of race relations in 1909 only to express satisfaction at the progress that had been made. And then the subject disappeared. FDR never mentioned it in any of his four inaugurals. \n\n         After World War II the subject came back to inaugural addresses, but in a weak and abstract form. That is true even of the presidents we think of as being most concerned with race relations in America--like Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, and Bill Clinton. Perhaps each thought he had made a sufficient statement by having a black woman--Marian Anderson, Leontyne Price, or Maya Angelou--perform at his ceremony. In Clinton's first inaugural, the only allusion to the race problem is in this sentence: \"From our revolution, the Civil War, to the Great Depression to the civil rights movement, our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history.\" I recall this not to suggest that their concern was not deep and sincere, but only to indicate what is acceptable to say in a speech intended to appeal to the values shared by Americans. \n\n         There is much more to ponder in these speeches than I have suggested here. There is much to be proud of, in what we have endured and achieved, in the peaceful transference of power, and in the reasonableness and moderation of the presidents we have elected. But there is also much humility to be learned. We look back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness revealed by what our past leaders have said and our past citizens believed. We should recognize that 50 or 100 years from now, readers will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today. \n\n          \n\n            POSTSCRIPT: To read Herbert Stein's analysis of President Clinton's second Inaugural Address, click .\n",

All are worth a read--not just the highlights, such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and FDR. They will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian of 1997 looking back at 1837 or 1897 but as an ordinary citizen who shares--and is limited by--the information, the concerns, and the values of those times. (Thanks to Columbia University, all the addresses can be found on the Web.) \n\n         Among all the past presidents and their speech writers there was only one literary genius: Lincoln. After 132 years, his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood. None of the other inaugural addresses are in that league. But by and large they are dignified and intelligent speeches given by articulate men, each in touch with his times and aware that his inauguration was the most solemn occasion of his life. \n\n         The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases. The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. This classification is not waterproof. Theodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase and Warren G. Harding-Calvin Coolidge-Herbert Hoover in the second. But the trend is clear. \n\n         On picking up Washington's first inaugural, one is immediately struck by the modesty. He had just been elected unanimously by the Electoral College. He was more respected than any subsequent president has been at the time of his inauguration. And what does he say? \n\n                         [T]he magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with despondence one who (inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies.              \n\n          None of his successors has made the point as forcefully as that. But echoes are to be found in almost every president for the next 68 years. (John Adams was an exception. He was apparently so envious of Washington that he spent a large part of his address spelling out his own excellent qualifications for the job.) That era ended with Lincoln. Subsequent inaugurals routinely contain protestations of humility, but they are perfunctory and do not sound sincere. \n\n         The antebellum modesty, while in part a reflection of the conventional etiquette of the time, may also have served a political objective: to alleviate the concerns of those who--in the early days of the republic--feared it might be transformed into a monarchy, and the president into a king. A little later, perhaps after 1820, a new worry arose. Would the power of the federal government be used to interfere with the \"peculiar domestic institution\" of the Southern states? The presidents' assurance of the limitation of their powers may have been intended to give comfort to those states. \n\n         Lincoln faced a different situation. With the South already seceding, he could only \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution\" by asserting the power of the federal government and his own power as chief executive. It was no time for modesty. Lincoln's successors inherited a federal government with much more authority--and more need to use it--than before the war, and they had less motivation to belittle themselves and their powers. \n\n         In the third phase, the Inaugural Address metamorphosed from describing the government's policy to inspiring the public's behavior. Presidents recognized--or, at least, believed--that the country had problems they ought to deal with but could not manage by using the instruments of government alone. Thus, in his first inaugural, Woodrow Wilson said: \"At last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole. We see the bad with the good, the debased and decadent with the sound and the vital. With this vision we approach new affairs.\" \n\n         If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government. Similar diagnoses and prescriptions appear in later inaugurals. \n\n          Presidents derived their license to serve as leader-preacher from Theodore Roosevelt's remark that the presidency was \"a bully pulpit,\" a remark that did not appear in his Inaugural Address. The metaphor of the pulpit suggests not reading but oral and visual contact between the preacher and his flock. Radio and--even more--television made this possible on a national scale. A telltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural is the use of the phrase, \"Let us ... \"--meaning, \"You do as I say.\" This expression appears occasionally throughout the history of inaugurals, but it has hit its stride in recent years. John F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times in his Inaugural Address, and Richard Nixon has it 22 times in his second one. \n\n         The change in literary style from classical to colloquial can be demonstrated by one statistic. In all the inaugurals from Washington through James Buchanan, the average number of words per sentence was 44. From Lincoln to Wilson it was 34, and since Wilson it has been 25. I do not consider this a deterioration (this article has an average of 17 words per sentence), but it does reflect the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication. William Henry Harrison could talk about the governments of Athens, Rome, and the Helvetic Confederacy and expect his audience to know what he was talking about. That wouldn't be true today. But Harrison's audience would not have known what the Internet was. \n\n         Presidents and their speech writers have mined their predecessors for memorable words and repeated them without attribution. Kennedy's trumpet call, \"Ask not what your country can do for you: Ask what you can do for your country,\" has an ironic history. In his inaugural, Harding, surely no model for Kennedy, had said, \"Our most dangerous tendency is to expect too little of government, and at the same time do for it too little.\" And even before he became president, in a speech in 1916, Harding had said, \"In the great fulfillment we must have a citizenship less concerned about what the government can do for it and more anxious about what it can do for the nation.\" \n\n         Many an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more. That includes the Indians, the coastal fortifications, territorial expansion, the Isthmus Canal, civil-service reform, polygamy, and Prohibition. Some subjects that you expect to appear, don't. Hoover's inaugural, March 4, 1929, gives no hint of economic vulnerability. Roosevelt's second inaugural, Jan. 20, 1937, contains no reference to Hitler or to Germany. But what is most amazing, at least to a reader in 1997, is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women. The word \"women\" does not appear at all until Wilson's first inaugural, and it always appears as part of the phrase \"men and women,\" never as referring to any special concerns of women. Even Harding, the first president to be chosen in an election in which women voted nationally, does not remark on the uniqueness of the fact in his inaugural. \n\n          One subject that does get ample treatment is taxes. \"Taxes,\" or some equivalent word, appears in 43 of the 52 inaugural addresses to date. Coolidge said in 1925: \"The time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction. ... I am opposed to extremely high rates, because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for the country, and, finally, because they are wrong.\" Federal taxes were then about 3 percent of the gross domestic product. Ronald Reagan said essentially the same thing in 1981, when they were 20 percent. \n\n         The most disturbing aspect of the whole series of inaugurals is what is said and unsaid on the subject of race relations, which Arthur Schlesinger Jr. calls \"the supreme American problem.\" The words \"black,\" \"blacks,\" \"Negro,\" or \"race\" (as applied to blacks) do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes, 1877. James Monroe asked in 1817, \"On whom has oppression fallen in any quarter of our Union? Who has been deprived of any right of person or property?\" These were rhetorical questions, intended to get the answer \"No one!\"--as if there were not millions of slaves in America. \n\n         Before the Civil War the word \"slavery\" appears only in the Inaugural Address of Martin Van Buren, 1837, and Buchanan, 1857, and then only as something that, pursuant to the Constitution and in order to preserve the Union, should not be interfered with. But although generally unmentionable, the subject was boiling, and would boil over in 1861. After the Civil War, it is in the inaugurals of Hayes, James Garfield (1881), and Benjamin Harrison (1889) that we find the most explicit and positive discussion of the need to convert into reality the rights and freedom granted to the \"freedmen\" on paper by the 13 th , 14 th , and 15 th amendments. Garfield's was the strongest among these. (He had been a student at Williams College in the 1850s, 80 years before me, when the college had been a station on the underground railway.) But the subject then began to fade. William McKinley said in his first Inaugural Address, March 4, 1897, \"Lynchings must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the United States,\" but he said it without horror. Taft raised the subject of race relations in 1909 only to express satisfaction at the progress that had been made. And then the subject disappeared. FDR never mentioned it in any of his four inaugurals. \n\n         After World War II the subject came back to inaugural addresses, but in a weak and abstract form. That is true even of the presidents we think of as being most concerned with race relations in America--like Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, and Bill Clinton. Perhaps each thought he had made a sufficient statement by having a black woman--Marian Anderson, Leontyne Price, or Maya Angelou--perform at his ceremony. In Clinton's first inaugural, the only allusion to the race problem is in this sentence: \"From our revolution, the Civil War, to the Great Depression to the civil rights movement, our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history.\" I recall this not to suggest that their concern was not deep and sincere, but only to indicate what is acceptable to say in a speech intended to appeal to the values shared by Americans. \n\n         There is much more to ponder in these speeches than I have suggested here. There is much to be proud of, in what we have endured and achieved, in the peaceful transference of power, and in the reasonableness and moderation of the presidents we have elected. But there is also much humility to be learned. We look back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness revealed by what our past leaders have said and our past citizens believed. We should recognize that 50 or 100 years from now, readers will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today. \n\n          \n\n            POSTSCRIPT: To read Herbert Stein's analysis of President Clinton's second Inaugural Address, click .\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhich was not an era of the inaugural addresses?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"commonplace manager of the country\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"demanding executive\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"demanding executive\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"demanding executive\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

All are worth a read--not just the highlights, such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and FDR. They will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian of 1997 looking back at 1837 or 1897 but as an ordinary citizen who shares--and is limited by--the information, the concerns, and the values of those times. (Thanks to Columbia University, all the addresses can be found on the Web.) \n\n         Among all the past presidents and their speech writers there was only one literary genius: Lincoln. After 132 years, his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood. None of the other inaugural addresses are in that league. But by and large they are dignified and intelligent speeches given by articulate men, each in touch with his times and aware that his inauguration was the most solemn occasion of his life. \n\n         The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases. The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. This classification is not waterproof. Theodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase and Warren G. Harding-Calvin Coolidge-Herbert Hoover in the second. But the trend is clear. \n\n         On picking up Washington's first inaugural, one is immediately struck by the modesty. He had just been elected unanimously by the Electoral College. He was more respected than any subsequent president has been at the time of his inauguration. And what does he say? \n\n                         [T]he magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with despondence one who (inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies.              \n\n          None of his successors has made the point as forcefully as that. But echoes are to be found in almost every president for the next 68 years. (John Adams was an exception. He was apparently so envious of Washington that he spent a large part of his address spelling out his own excellent qualifications for the job.) That era ended with Lincoln. Subsequent inaugurals routinely contain protestations of humility, but they are perfunctory and do not sound sincere. \n\n         The antebellum modesty, while in part a reflection of the conventional etiquette of the time, may also have served a political objective: to alleviate the concerns of those who--in the early days of the republic--feared it might be transformed into a monarchy, and the president into a king. A little later, perhaps after 1820, a new worry arose. Would the power of the federal government be used to interfere with the \"peculiar domestic institution\" of the Southern states? The presidents' assurance of the limitation of their powers may have been intended to give comfort to those states. \n\n         Lincoln faced a different situation. With the South already seceding, he could only \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution\" by asserting the power of the federal government and his own power as chief executive. It was no time for modesty. Lincoln's successors inherited a federal government with much more authority--and more need to use it--than before the war, and they had less motivation to belittle themselves and their powers. \n\n         In the third phase, the Inaugural Address metamorphosed from describing the government's policy to inspiring the public's behavior. Presidents recognized--or, at least, believed--that the country had problems they ought to deal with but could not manage by using the instruments of government alone. Thus, in his first inaugural, Woodrow Wilson said: \"At last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole. We see the bad with the good, the debased and decadent with the sound and the vital. With this vision we approach new affairs.\" \n\n         If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government. Similar diagnoses and prescriptions appear in later inaugurals. \n\n          Presidents derived their license to serve as leader-preacher from Theodore Roosevelt's remark that the presidency was \"a bully pulpit,\" a remark that did not appear in his Inaugural Address. The metaphor of the pulpit suggests not reading but oral and visual contact between the preacher and his flock. Radio and--even more--television made this possible on a national scale. A telltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural is the use of the phrase, \"Let us ... \"--meaning, \"You do as I say.\" This expression appears occasionally throughout the history of inaugurals, but it has hit its stride in recent years. John F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times in his Inaugural Address, and Richard Nixon has it 22 times in his second one. \n\n         The change in literary style from classical to colloquial can be demonstrated by one statistic. In all the inaugurals from Washington through James Buchanan, the average number of words per sentence was 44. From Lincoln to Wilson it was 34, and since Wilson it has been 25. I do not consider this a deterioration (this article has an average of 17 words per sentence), but it does reflect the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication. William Henry Harrison could talk about the governments of Athens, Rome, and the Helvetic Confederacy and expect his audience to know what he was talking about. That wouldn't be true today. But Harrison's audience would not have known what the Internet was. \n\n         Presidents and their speech writers have mined their predecessors for memorable words and repeated them without attribution. Kennedy's trumpet call, \"Ask not what your country can do for you: Ask what you can do for your country,\" has an ironic history. In his inaugural, Harding, surely no model for Kennedy, had said, \"Our most dangerous tendency is to expect too little of government, and at the same time do for it too little.\" And even before he became president, in a speech in 1916, Harding had said, \"In the great fulfillment we must have a citizenship less concerned about what the government can do for it and more anxious about what it can do for the nation.\" \n\n         Many an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more. That includes the Indians, the coastal fortifications, territorial expansion, the Isthmus Canal, civil-service reform, polygamy, and Prohibition. Some subjects that you expect to appear, don't. Hoover's inaugural, March 4, 1929, gives no hint of economic vulnerability. Roosevelt's second inaugural, Jan. 20, 1937, contains no reference to Hitler or to Germany. But what is most amazing, at least to a reader in 1997, is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women. The word \"women\" does not appear at all until Wilson's first inaugural, and it always appears as part of the phrase \"men and women,\" never as referring to any special concerns of women. Even Harding, the first president to be chosen in an election in which women voted nationally, does not remark on the uniqueness of the fact in his inaugural. \n\n          One subject that does get ample treatment is taxes. \"Taxes,\" or some equivalent word, appears in 43 of the 52 inaugural addresses to date. Coolidge said in 1925: \"The time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction. ... I am opposed to extremely high rates, because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for the country, and, finally, because they are wrong.\" Federal taxes were then about 3 percent of the gross domestic product. Ronald Reagan said essentially the same thing in 1981, when they were 20 percent. \n\n         The most disturbing aspect of the whole series of inaugurals is what is said and unsaid on the subject of race relations, which Arthur Schlesinger Jr. calls \"the supreme American problem.\" The words \"black,\" \"blacks,\" \"Negro,\" or \"race\" (as applied to blacks) do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes, 1877. James Monroe asked in 1817, \"On whom has oppression fallen in any quarter of our Union? Who has been deprived of any right of person or property?\" These were rhetorical questions, intended to get the answer \"No one!\"--as if there were not millions of slaves in America. \n\n         Before the Civil War the word \"slavery\" appears only in the Inaugural Address of Martin Van Buren, 1837, and Buchanan, 1857, and then only as something that, pursuant to the Constitution and in order to preserve the Union, should not be interfered with. But although generally unmentionable, the subject was boiling, and would boil over in 1861. After the Civil War, it is in the inaugurals of Hayes, James Garfield (1881), and Benjamin Harrison (1889) that we find the most explicit and positive discussion of the need to convert into reality the rights and freedom granted to the \"freedmen\" on paper by the 13 th , 14 th , and 15 th amendments. Garfield's was the strongest among these. (He had been a student at Williams College in the 1850s, 80 years before me, when the college had been a station on the underground railway.) But the subject then began to fade. William McKinley said in his first Inaugural Address, March 4, 1897, \"Lynchings must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the United States,\" but he said it without horror. Taft raised the subject of race relations in 1909 only to express satisfaction at the progress that had been made. And then the subject disappeared. FDR never mentioned it in any of his four inaugurals. \n\n         After World War II the subject came back to inaugural addresses, but in a weak and abstract form. That is true even of the presidents we think of as being most concerned with race relations in America--like Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, and Bill Clinton. Perhaps each thought he had made a sufficient statement by having a black woman--Marian Anderson, Leontyne Price, or Maya Angelou--perform at his ceremony. In Clinton's first inaugural, the only allusion to the race problem is in this sentence: \"From our revolution, the Civil War, to the Great Depression to the civil rights movement, our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history.\" I recall this not to suggest that their concern was not deep and sincere, but only to indicate what is acceptable to say in a speech intended to appeal to the values shared by Americans. \n\n         There is much more to ponder in these speeches than I have suggested here. There is much to be proud of, in what we have endured and achieved, in the peaceful transference of power, and in the reasonableness and moderation of the presidents we have elected. But there is also much humility to be learned. We look back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness revealed by what our past leaders have said and our past citizens believed. We should recognize that 50 or 100 years from now, readers will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today. \n\n          \n\n            POSTSCRIPT: To read Herbert Stein's analysis of President Clinton's second Inaugural Address, click .\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhich was not an era of the inaugural addresses?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"demanding executive\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"commonplace manager of the country\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"commonplace manager of the country\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"commonplace manager of the country\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

All are worth a read--not just the highlights, such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and FDR. They will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian of 1997 looking back at 1837 or 1897 but as an ordinary citizen who shares--and is limited by--the information, the concerns, and the values of those times. (Thanks to Columbia University, all the addresses can be found on the Web.) \n\n         Among all the past presidents and their speech writers there was only one literary genius: Lincoln. After 132 years, his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood. None of the other inaugural addresses are in that league. But by and large they are dignified and intelligent speeches given by articulate men, each in touch with his times and aware that his inauguration was the most solemn occasion of his life. \n\n         The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases. The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. This classification is not waterproof. Theodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase and Warren G. Harding-Calvin Coolidge-Herbert Hoover in the second. But the trend is clear. \n\n         On picking up Washington's first inaugural, one is immediately struck by the modesty. He had just been elected unanimously by the Electoral College. He was more respected than any subsequent president has been at the time of his inauguration. And what does he say? \n\n                         [T]he magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with despondence one who (inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies.              \n\n          None of his successors has made the point as forcefully as that. But echoes are to be found in almost every president for the next 68 years. (John Adams was an exception. He was apparently so envious of Washington that he spent a large part of his address spelling out his own excellent qualifications for the job.) That era ended with Lincoln. Subsequent inaugurals routinely contain protestations of humility, but they are perfunctory and do not sound sincere. \n\n         The antebellum modesty, while in part a reflection of the conventional etiquette of the time, may also have served a political objective: to alleviate the concerns of those who--in the early days of the republic--feared it might be transformed into a monarchy, and the president into a king. A little later, perhaps after 1820, a new worry arose. Would the power of the federal government be used to interfere with the \"peculiar domestic institution\" of the Southern states? The presidents' assurance of the limitation of their powers may have been intended to give comfort to those states. \n\n         Lincoln faced a different situation. With the South already seceding, he could only \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution\" by asserting the power of the federal government and his own power as chief executive. It was no time for modesty. Lincoln's successors inherited a federal government with much more authority--and more need to use it--than before the war, and they had less motivation to belittle themselves and their powers. \n\n         In the third phase, the Inaugural Address metamorphosed from describing the government's policy to inspiring the public's behavior. Presidents recognized--or, at least, believed--that the country had problems they ought to deal with but could not manage by using the instruments of government alone. Thus, in his first inaugural, Woodrow Wilson said: \"At last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole. We see the bad with the good, the debased and decadent with the sound and the vital. With this vision we approach new affairs.\" \n\n         If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government. Similar diagnoses and prescriptions appear in later inaugurals. \n\n          Presidents derived their license to serve as leader-preacher from Theodore Roosevelt's remark that the presidency was \"a bully pulpit,\" a remark that did not appear in his Inaugural Address. The metaphor of the pulpit suggests not reading but oral and visual contact between the preacher and his flock. Radio and--even more--television made this possible on a national scale. A telltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural is the use of the phrase, \"Let us ... \"--meaning, \"You do as I say.\" This expression appears occasionally throughout the history of inaugurals, but it has hit its stride in recent years. John F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times in his Inaugural Address, and Richard Nixon has it 22 times in his second one. \n\n         The change in literary style from classical to colloquial can be demonstrated by one statistic. In all the inaugurals from Washington through James Buchanan, the average number of words per sentence was 44. From Lincoln to Wilson it was 34, and since Wilson it has been 25. I do not consider this a deterioration (this article has an average of 17 words per sentence), but it does reflect the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication. William Henry Harrison could talk about the governments of Athens, Rome, and the Helvetic Confederacy and expect his audience to know what he was talking about. That wouldn't be true today. But Harrison's audience would not have known what the Internet was. \n\n         Presidents and their speech writers have mined their predecessors for memorable words and repeated them without attribution. Kennedy's trumpet call, \"Ask not what your country can do for you: Ask what you can do for your country,\" has an ironic history. In his inaugural, Harding, surely no model for Kennedy, had said, \"Our most dangerous tendency is to expect too little of government, and at the same time do for it too little.\" And even before he became president, in a speech in 1916, Harding had said, \"In the great fulfillment we must have a citizenship less concerned about what the government can do for it and more anxious about what it can do for the nation.\" \n\n         Many an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more. That includes the Indians, the coastal fortifications, territorial expansion, the Isthmus Canal, civil-service reform, polygamy, and Prohibition. Some subjects that you expect to appear, don't. Hoover's inaugural, March 4, 1929, gives no hint of economic vulnerability. Roosevelt's second inaugural, Jan. 20, 1937, contains no reference to Hitler or to Germany. But what is most amazing, at least to a reader in 1997, is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women. The word \"women\" does not appear at all until Wilson's first inaugural, and it always appears as part of the phrase \"men and women,\" never as referring to any special concerns of women. Even Harding, the first president to be chosen in an election in which women voted nationally, does not remark on the uniqueness of the fact in his inaugural. \n\n          One subject that does get ample treatment is taxes. \"Taxes,\" or some equivalent word, appears in 43 of the 52 inaugural addresses to date. Coolidge said in 1925: \"The time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction. ... I am opposed to extremely high rates, because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for the country, and, finally, because they are wrong.\" Federal taxes were then about 3 percent of the gross domestic product. Ronald Reagan said essentially the same thing in 1981, when they were 20 percent. \n\n         The most disturbing aspect of the whole series of inaugurals is what is said and unsaid on the subject of race relations, which Arthur Schlesinger Jr. calls \"the supreme American problem.\" The words \"black,\" \"blacks,\" \"Negro,\" or \"race\" (as applied to blacks) do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes, 1877. James Monroe asked in 1817, \"On whom has oppression fallen in any quarter of our Union? Who has been deprived of any right of person or property?\" These were rhetorical questions, intended to get the answer \"No one!\"--as if there were not millions of slaves in America. \n\n         Before the Civil War the word \"slavery\" appears only in the Inaugural Address of Martin Van Buren, 1837, and Buchanan, 1857, and then only as something that, pursuant to the Constitution and in order to preserve the Union, should not be interfered with. But although generally unmentionable, the subject was boiling, and would boil over in 1861. After the Civil War, it is in the inaugurals of Hayes, James Garfield (1881), and Benjamin Harrison (1889) that we find the most explicit and positive discussion of the need to convert into reality the rights and freedom granted to the \"freedmen\" on paper by the 13 th , 14 th , and 15 th amendments. Garfield's was the strongest among these. (He had been a student at Williams College in the 1850s, 80 years before me, when the college had been a station on the underground railway.) But the subject then began to fade. William McKinley said in his first Inaugural Address, March 4, 1897, \"Lynchings must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the United States,\" but he said it without horror. Taft raised the subject of race relations in 1909 only to express satisfaction at the progress that had been made. And then the subject disappeared. FDR never mentioned it in any of his four inaugurals. \n\n         After World War II the subject came back to inaugural addresses, but in a weak and abstract form. That is true even of the presidents we think of as being most concerned with race relations in America--like Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, and Bill Clinton. Perhaps each thought he had made a sufficient statement by having a black woman--Marian Anderson, Leontyne Price, or Maya Angelou--perform at his ceremony. In Clinton's first inaugural, the only allusion to the race problem is in this sentence: \"From our revolution, the Civil War, to the Great Depression to the civil rights movement, our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history.\" I recall this not to suggest that their concern was not deep and sincere, but only to indicate what is acceptable to say in a speech intended to appeal to the values shared by Americans. \n\n         There is much more to ponder in these speeches than I have suggested here. There is much to be proud of, in what we have endured and achieved, in the peaceful transference of power, and in the reasonableness and moderation of the presidents we have elected. But there is also much humility to be learned. We look back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness revealed by what our past leaders have said and our past citizens believed. We should recognize that 50 or 100 years from now, readers will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today. \n\n          \n\n            POSTSCRIPT: To read Herbert Stein's analysis of President Clinton's second Inaugural Address, click .\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhich was not an era of the inaugural addresses?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"commonplace manager of the country\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"demanding executive\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"demanding executive\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI stand by the proposition that \u201cthe demanding executive\u201d is not one of the eras described in the background text.

Behavioral function  \n     \u2022 The only time presidents \u201cdemand\u201d or \u201cLet us\u2026\u201d is in the leader-preacher phase, intended to \u201cinspiring the public\u2019s behavior,\u201d not managing government alone. <invalid_quote>Presidents derived their license \u2026 from Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s remark that the presidency was \u2018a bully pulpit.\u2019 \u2026 A telltale sign \u2026 is the use of the phrase \u2018Let us \u2026\u2019\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2022 That \u201cLet us\u201d form appears exclusively in Phase Three, confirming the \u201cdemanding\u201d rhetoric belongs to the theatrical-preacher, not a separate executive-management era.  \n  c. Sentence-length metric  \n     \u2022 A steady decline from 44 to 34 to 25 words per sentence tracks the phases from formal (Phase One) through prosaic (Phase Two) to colloquial (Phase Three). No further drop or phase suggests an unmentioned \u201cdemanding executive\u201d period.  \n\n3. Debater_B\u2019s Position Contradicts Clear Evidence  \n  a. Misreads \u201cprosaic government executive\u201d  \n     \u2022 Debater_B asserts the prosaic manager era is missing; yet the text explicitly labels it Phase Two. Ignoring that label undermines any claim of absence.  \n  b. Conflates \u201cassertive\u201d with \u201cdemanding executive\u201d  \n     \u2022 The \u201cassertive, theatrical leader-preacher\u201d is not merely a stronger executive but a figure who bypasses governmental instruments to \u201cuplift the people.\u201d <quote>country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government.</quote>  \n     \u2022 A true \u201cdemanding executive\u201d would rely on government tools, but the text emphasizes that Phase Three resorted to moral suasion because government alone was insufficient.  \n  c. No textual warrant for a fourth phase  \n     \u2022 The author warns that \u201cthis classification is not waterproof\u201d but nonetheless presents only three. Speculating a \u201cdemanding executive\u201d phase introduces unsupported categories.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe background text clearly enumerates exactly three inaugural-\u00adaddress eras and situates all \u201cdemanding\u201d or directive language in the theatrical-preacher phase, whose purpose is moral uplift rather than executive administration. No separate \u201cdemanding executive\u201d era exists. Therefore, the only defensible \u201cnot-era\u201d answer is \u201cdemanding executive.\u201d\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cCommonplace Manager of the Country\u201d as the Non-Era\n\n1. The author defines only three \u201cphases\u201d of inaugurals:\n   a. Phase 1: \u201cmodest, classic public servant\u201d until Lincoln (p. 2).  \n   b. Phase 2: \u201cprosaic government executive\u201d only up through Taft (p. 3).  \n   c. Phase 3: \u201cassertive, theatrical leader-preacher\u201d from Wilson to today (p. 5).  \n   There is no independent \u201ccommonplace manager\u201d era distinct from these three. What Debater_A calls \u201cdemanding executive\u201d plainly corresponds to Phase 3\u2019s \u201cLet us\u2026\u201d leader-preacher (Kennedy, Nixon) <invalid_quote>\u201c\u2018Let us\u2026\u2019\u2026John F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times\u2026Richard Nixon\u202622 times\u201d</invalid_quote> (p. 6).  \n\n2. Phase 2 is transitional and insignificant:\n   \u2013 The author admits the classification \u201cis not waterproof,\u201d citing Theodore Roosevelt as possibly Phase 3 and Harding\u2013Coolidge\u2013Hoover as Phase 2 (p. 3).  \n   \u2013 After Lincoln, inaugurals \u201croutinely contain protestations of humility, but they are perfunctory and do not sound sincere\u201d (p. 3). They immediately evolve toward Wilson\u2019s uplifting public appeals <quote> If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people,</quote> (p. 5). By 1913 (Wilson) the inaugural is already \u201cleader-preacher.\u201d The \u201cprosaic executive\u201d barely lasts three presidencies. It cannot count as a full \u201cera.\u201d  \n\n3. The textual emphasis is on the evolution from modesty to preaching, not on managerial administration:\n   \u2013 The centerpiece of the author\u2019s narrative is the post-Civil War expansion of federal power and the need to inspire citizens, not to manage routine government (pp. 4\u20135).  \n   \u2013 The statistics on sentence length highlight the shift from \u201cclassical\u201d to \u201ccolloquial,\u201d reflecting a change in style and audience\u2014again toward oratory and mass communication, not dry management (p. 7).  \n\n4. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cDemanding Executive\u201d is merely Phase 3 under a different label:\n   \u2013 \u201cDemanding\u201d fits with \u201cleader-preacher,\u201d whose hallmark is exhortation (\u201cLet us\u2026\u201d) (p. 6).  \n   \u2013 The author explicitly associates the \u201cbully pulpit\u201d with Theodore Roosevelt, a proponent of active executive leadership (p. 5), and traces this style through modern inaugurals.  \n\n5. \u201cCommonplace manager\u201d is never so labeled by the author:\n   \u2013 No inaugural is praised for being an administrative manual; instead, inaugurals are judged on \u201cliterary style\u201d (p. 2), \u201csolemnity\u201d (p. 2), \u201cvision\u201d (p. 5), and \u201cmemorable words\u201d (p. 7).  \n   \u2013 Subjects like \u201ctaxes\u201d and \u201crace\u201d are treated rhetorically to inspire or reassure, not to detail bureaucratic procedures (pp. 8\u201310).  \n\nObjections to Debater_A\u2019s Position:\n\u2013 They misread Phase 2 as a distinct \u201cera\u201d of sufficient length and impact. In fact, the author sees it as abbreviated and \u201cnot waterproof\u201d (p. 3), quickly giving way to preaching.  \n\u2013 They fail to explain why \u201cdemanding executive\u201d inaugurals would abandon the \u201cLet us\u2026\u201d exhortations and colloquial style central to Phase 3.  \n\u2013 They ignore the author\u2019s focus on \u201coral and visual contact\u201d enabled by radio/TV, which presupposes charismatic leadership, not managerial routine (p. 5).  \n\nConclusion  \nSince the text defines only three overlapping phases\u2014modest servant, brief prosaic executive, long-standing leader-preacher\u2014and the \u201ccommonplace manager\u201d never emerges as a sustained literary style or purposive era, \u201ccommonplace manager of the country\u201d is the non-existent era.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"demanding executive\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

All are worth a read--not just the highlights, such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and FDR. They will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian of 1997 looking back at 1837 or 1897 but as an ordinary citizen who shares--and is limited by--the information, the concerns, and the values of those times. (Thanks to Columbia University, all the addresses can be found on the Web.) \n\n         Among all the past presidents and their speech writers there was only one literary genius: Lincoln. After 132 years, his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood. None of the other inaugural addresses are in that league. But by and large they are dignified and intelligent speeches given by articulate men, each in touch with his times and aware that his inauguration was the most solemn occasion of his life. \n\n         The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases. The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. This classification is not waterproof. Theodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase and Warren G. Harding-Calvin Coolidge-Herbert Hoover in the second. But the trend is clear. \n\n         On picking up Washington's first inaugural, one is immediately struck by the modesty. He had just been elected unanimously by the Electoral College. He was more respected than any subsequent president has been at the time of his inauguration. And what does he say? \n\n                         [T]he magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with despondence one who (inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies.              \n\n          None of his successors has made the point as forcefully as that. But echoes are to be found in almost every president for the next 68 years. (John Adams was an exception. He was apparently so envious of Washington that he spent a large part of his address spelling out his own excellent qualifications for the job.) That era ended with Lincoln. Subsequent inaugurals routinely contain protestations of humility, but they are perfunctory and do not sound sincere. \n\n         The antebellum modesty, while in part a reflection of the conventional etiquette of the time, may also have served a political objective: to alleviate the concerns of those who--in the early days of the republic--feared it might be transformed into a monarchy, and the president into a king. A little later, perhaps after 1820, a new worry arose. Would the power of the federal government be used to interfere with the \"peculiar domestic institution\" of the Southern states? The presidents' assurance of the limitation of their powers may have been intended to give comfort to those states. \n\n         Lincoln faced a different situation. With the South already seceding, he could only \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution\" by asserting the power of the federal government and his own power as chief executive. It was no time for modesty. Lincoln's successors inherited a federal government with much more authority--and more need to use it--than before the war, and they had less motivation to belittle themselves and their powers. \n\n         In the third phase, the Inaugural Address metamorphosed from describing the government's policy to inspiring the public's behavior. Presidents recognized--or, at least, believed--that the country had problems they ought to deal with but could not manage by using the instruments of government alone. Thus, in his first inaugural, Woodrow Wilson said: \"At last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole. We see the bad with the good, the debased and decadent with the sound and the vital. With this vision we approach new affairs.\" \n\n         If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government. Similar diagnoses and prescriptions appear in later inaugurals. \n\n          Presidents derived their license to serve as leader-preacher from Theodore Roosevelt's remark that the presidency was \"a bully pulpit,\" a remark that did not appear in his Inaugural Address. The metaphor of the pulpit suggests not reading but oral and visual contact between the preacher and his flock. Radio and--even more--television made this possible on a national scale. A telltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural is the use of the phrase, \"Let us ... \"--meaning, \"You do as I say.\" This expression appears occasionally throughout the history of inaugurals, but it has hit its stride in recent years. John F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times in his Inaugural Address, and Richard Nixon has it 22 times in his second one. \n\n         The change in literary style from classical to colloquial can be demonstrated by one statistic. In all the inaugurals from Washington through James Buchanan, the average number of words per sentence was 44. From Lincoln to Wilson it was 34, and since Wilson it has been 25. I do not consider this a deterioration (this article has an average of 17 words per sentence), but it does reflect the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication. William Henry Harrison could talk about the governments of Athens, Rome, and the Helvetic Confederacy and expect his audience to know what he was talking about. That wouldn't be true today. But Harrison's audience would not have known what the Internet was. \n\n         Presidents and their speech writers have mined their predecessors for memorable words and repeated them without attribution. Kennedy's trumpet call, \"Ask not what your country can do for you: Ask what you can do for your country,\" has an ironic history. In his inaugural, Harding, surely no model for Kennedy, had said, \"Our most dangerous tendency is to expect too little of government, and at the same time do for it too little.\" And even before he became president, in a speech in 1916, Harding had said, \"In the great fulfillment we must have a citizenship less concerned about what the government can do for it and more anxious about what it can do for the nation.\" \n\n         Many an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more. That includes the Indians, the coastal fortifications, territorial expansion, the Isthmus Canal, civil-service reform, polygamy, and Prohibition. Some subjects that you expect to appear, don't. Hoover's inaugural, March 4, 1929, gives no hint of economic vulnerability. Roosevelt's second inaugural, Jan. 20, 1937, contains no reference to Hitler or to Germany. But what is most amazing, at least to a reader in 1997, is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women. The word \"women\" does not appear at all until Wilson's first inaugural, and it always appears as part of the phrase \"men and women,\" never as referring to any special concerns of women. Even Harding, the first president to be chosen in an election in which women voted nationally, does not remark on the uniqueness of the fact in his inaugural. \n\n          One subject that does get ample treatment is taxes. \"Taxes,\" or some equivalent word, appears in 43 of the 52 inaugural addresses to date. Coolidge said in 1925: \"The time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction. ... I am opposed to extremely high rates, because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for the country, and, finally, because they are wrong.\" Federal taxes were then about 3 percent of the gross domestic product. Ronald Reagan said essentially the same thing in 1981, when they were 20 percent. \n\n         The most disturbing aspect of the whole series of inaugurals is what is said and unsaid on the subject of race relations, which Arthur Schlesinger Jr. calls \"the supreme American problem.\" The words \"black,\" \"blacks,\" \"Negro,\" or \"race\" (as applied to blacks) do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes, 1877. James Monroe asked in 1817, \"On whom has oppression fallen in any quarter of our Union? Who has been deprived of any right of person or property?\" These were rhetorical questions, intended to get the answer \"No one!\"--as if there were not millions of slaves in America. \n\n         Before the Civil War the word \"slavery\" appears only in the Inaugural Address of Martin Van Buren, 1837, and Buchanan, 1857, and then only as something that, pursuant to the Constitution and in order to preserve the Union, should not be interfered with. But although generally unmentionable, the subject was boiling, and would boil over in 1861. After the Civil War, it is in the inaugurals of Hayes, James Garfield (1881), and Benjamin Harrison (1889) that we find the most explicit and positive discussion of the need to convert into reality the rights and freedom granted to the \"freedmen\" on paper by the 13 th , 14 th , and 15 th amendments. Garfield's was the strongest among these. (He had been a student at Williams College in the 1850s, 80 years before me, when the college had been a station on the underground railway.) But the subject then began to fade. William McKinley said in his first Inaugural Address, March 4, 1897, \"Lynchings must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the United States,\" but he said it without horror. Taft raised the subject of race relations in 1909 only to express satisfaction at the progress that had been made. And then the subject disappeared. FDR never mentioned it in any of his four inaugurals. \n\n         After World War II the subject came back to inaugural addresses, but in a weak and abstract form. That is true even of the presidents we think of as being most concerned with race relations in America--like Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, and Bill Clinton. Perhaps each thought he had made a sufficient statement by having a black woman--Marian Anderson, Leontyne Price, or Maya Angelou--perform at his ceremony. In Clinton's first inaugural, the only allusion to the race problem is in this sentence: \"From our revolution, the Civil War, to the Great Depression to the civil rights movement, our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history.\" I recall this not to suggest that their concern was not deep and sincere, but only to indicate what is acceptable to say in a speech intended to appeal to the values shared by Americans. \n\n         There is much more to ponder in these speeches than I have suggested here. There is much to be proud of, in what we have endured and achieved, in the peaceful transference of power, and in the reasonableness and moderation of the presidents we have elected. But there is also much humility to be learned. We look back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness revealed by what our past leaders have said and our past citizens believed. We should recognize that 50 or 100 years from now, readers will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today. \n\n          \n\n            POSTSCRIPT: To read Herbert Stein's analysis of President Clinton's second Inaugural Address, click .\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhich was not an era of the inaugural addresses?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"demanding executive\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"commonplace manager of the country\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"commonplace manager of the country\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cCommonplace Manager of the Country\u201d as the Non-Era\n\n1. The author defines only three \u201cphases\u201d of inaugurals:\n   a. Phase 1: \u201cmodest, classic public servant\u201d until Lincoln (p. 2).  \n   b. Phase 2: \u201cprosaic government executive\u201d only up through Taft (p. 3).  \n   c. Phase 3: \u201cassertive, theatrical leader-preacher\u201d from Wilson to today (p. 5).  \n   There is no independent \u201ccommonplace manager\u201d era distinct from these three. What Debater_A calls \u201cdemanding executive\u201d plainly corresponds to Phase 3\u2019s \u201cLet us\u2026\u201d leader-preacher (Kennedy, Nixon) <invalid_quote>\u201c\u2018Let us\u2026\u2019\u2026John F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times\u2026Richard Nixon\u202622 times\u201d</invalid_quote> (p. 6).  \n\n2. Phase 2 is transitional and insignificant:\n   \u2013 The author admits the classification \u201cis not waterproof,\u201d citing Theodore Roosevelt as possibly Phase 3 and Harding\u2013Coolidge\u2013Hoover as Phase 2 (p. 3).  \n   \u2013 After Lincoln, inaugurals \u201croutinely contain protestations of humility, but they are perfunctory and do not sound sincere\u201d (p. 3). They immediately evolve toward Wilson\u2019s uplifting public appeals <quote> If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people,</quote> (p. 5). By 1913 (Wilson) the inaugural is already \u201cleader-preacher.\u201d The \u201cprosaic executive\u201d barely lasts three presidencies. It cannot count as a full \u201cera.\u201d  \n\n3. The textual emphasis is on the evolution from modesty to preaching, not on managerial administration:\n   \u2013 The centerpiece of the author\u2019s narrative is the post-Civil War expansion of federal power and the need to inspire citizens, not to manage routine government (pp. 4\u20135).  \n   \u2013 The statistics on sentence length highlight the shift from \u201cclassical\u201d to \u201ccolloquial,\u201d reflecting a change in style and audience\u2014again toward oratory and mass communication, not dry management (p. 7).  \n\n4. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cDemanding Executive\u201d is merely Phase 3 under a different label:\n   \u2013 \u201cDemanding\u201d fits with \u201cleader-preacher,\u201d whose hallmark is exhortation (\u201cLet us\u2026\u201d) (p. 6).  \n   \u2013 The author explicitly associates the \u201cbully pulpit\u201d with Theodore Roosevelt, a proponent of active executive leadership (p. 5), and traces this style through modern inaugurals.  \n\n5. \u201cCommonplace manager\u201d is never so labeled by the author:\n   \u2013 No inaugural is praised for being an administrative manual; instead, inaugurals are judged on \u201cliterary style\u201d (p. 2), \u201csolemnity\u201d (p. 2), \u201cvision\u201d (p. 5), and \u201cmemorable words\u201d (p. 7).  \n   \u2013 Subjects like \u201ctaxes\u201d and \u201crace\u201d are treated rhetorically to inspire or reassure, not to detail bureaucratic procedures (pp. 8\u201310).  \n\nObjections to Debater_A\u2019s Position:\n\u2013 They misread Phase 2 as a distinct \u201cera\u201d of sufficient length and impact. In fact, the author sees it as abbreviated and \u201cnot waterproof\u201d (p. 3), quickly giving way to preaching.  \n\u2013 They fail to explain why \u201cdemanding executive\u201d inaugurals would abandon the \u201cLet us\u2026\u201d exhortations and colloquial style central to Phase 3.  \n\u2013 They ignore the author\u2019s focus on \u201coral and visual contact\u201d enabled by radio/TV, which presupposes charismatic leadership, not managerial routine (p. 5).  \n\nConclusion  \nSince the text defines only three overlapping phases\u2014modest servant, brief prosaic executive, long-standing leader-preacher\u2014and the \u201ccommonplace manager\u201d never emerges as a sustained literary style or purposive era, \u201ccommonplace manager of the country\u201d is the non-existent era.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI stand by the proposition that \u201cthe demanding executive\u201d is not one of the eras described in the background text. My opponent\u2019s claim that the \u201ccommonplace manager of the country\u201d (the prosaic government executive) is absent flatly contradicts explicit textual evidence. I will (1) marshal the text\u2019s clear tripartite chronology, (2) show that \u201cdemanding executive\u201d does not appear as a distinct phase, and (3) expose the flaws in Debater_B\u2019s interpretation.\n\n1. The Text Defines Three Phases  \n  a. Phase One: \u201cmodest, classic public servant\u201d  \n     \u2022 \u201cThe stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases. The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant.\u201d <quote>until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant.</quote>  \n  b. Phase Two: \u201cprosaic government executive\u201d  \n     \u2022 \u201cThe second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive.\u201d <quote>Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive.</quote>  \n  c. Phase Three: \u201cassertive, theatrical leader-preacher\u201d  \n     \u2022 \u201cThe third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher.\u201d <quote>we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher.</quote>  \n\n   These are the only eras the author identifies. By strict enumeration, any other label\u2014such as \u201cdemanding executive\u201d\u2014falls outside the text\u2019s taxonomy.\n\n2. No Basis for a \u201cDemanding Executive\u201d Era  \n  a. Terminology absent  \n     \u2022 The adjective \u201cdemanding\u201d never appears in discussing any era. The author contrasts \u201cmodesty\u201d with \u201cassertiveness\u201d (leader-preacher), not an intermediate \u201cdemanding\u201d stance.  \n  b. Behavioral function  \n     \u2022 The only time presidents \u201cdemand\u201d or \u201cLet us\u2026\u201d is in the leader-preacher phase, intended to \u201cinspiring the public\u2019s behavior,\u201d not managing government alone. <invalid_quote>Presidents derived their license \u2026 from Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s remark that the presidency was \u2018a bully pulpit.\u2019 \u2026 A telltale sign \u2026 is the use of the phrase \u2018Let us \u2026\u2019\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2022 That \u201cLet us\u201d form appears exclusively in Phase Three, confirming the \u201cdemanding\u201d rhetoric belongs to the theatrical-preacher, not a separate executive-management era.  \n  c. Sentence-length metric  \n     \u2022 A steady decline from 44 to 34 to 25 words per sentence tracks the phases from formal (Phase One) through prosaic (Phase Two) to colloquial (Phase Three). No further drop or phase suggests an unmentioned \u201cdemanding executive\u201d period.  \n\n3. Debater_B\u2019s Position Contradicts Clear Evidence  \n  a. Misreads \u201cprosaic government executive\u201d  \n     \u2022 Debater_B asserts the prosaic manager era is missing; yet the text explicitly labels it Phase Two. Ignoring that label undermines any claim of absence.  \n  b. Conflates \u201cassertive\u201d with \u201cdemanding executive\u201d  \n     \u2022 The \u201cassertive, theatrical leader-preacher\u201d is not merely a stronger executive but a figure who bypasses governmental instruments to \u201cuplift the people.\u201d <quote>country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government.</quote>  \n     \u2022 A true \u201cdemanding executive\u201d would rely on government tools, but the text emphasizes that Phase Three resorted to moral suasion because government alone was insufficient.  \n  c. No textual warrant for a fourth phase  \n     \u2022 The author warns that \u201cthis classification is not waterproof\u201d but nonetheless presents only three. Speculating a \u201cdemanding executive\u201d phase introduces unsupported categories.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe background text clearly enumerates exactly three inaugural-\u00adaddress eras and situates all \u201cdemanding\u201d or directive language in the theatrical-preacher phase, whose purpose is moral uplift rather than executive administration. No separate \u201cdemanding executive\u201d era exists. Therefore, the only defensible \u201cnot-era\u201d answer is \u201cdemanding executive.\u201d\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"commonplace manager of the country\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Debater_A\u2019s \u201cDemanding Executive\u201d is merely Phase 3 under a different label:\n   \u2013 \u201cDemanding\u201d fits with \u201cleader-preacher,\u201d whose hallmark is exhortation (\u201cLet us\u2026\u201d) (p. 6).  \n   \u2013 The author explicitly associates the \u201cbully pulpit\u201d with Theodore Roosevelt, a proponent of active executive leadership (p. 5), and traces this style through modern inaugurals.  \n\n5. \u201cCommonplace manager\u201d is never so labeled by the author:\n   \u2013 No inaugural is praised for being an administrative manual; instead, inaugurals are judged on \u201cliterary style\u201d (p. 2), \u201csolemnity\u201d (p. 2), \u201cvision\u201d (p. 5), and \u201cmemorable words\u201d (p. 7).  \n   \u2013 Subjects like \u201ctaxes\u201d and \u201crace\u201d are treated rhetorically to inspire or reassure, not to detail bureaucratic procedures (pp. 8\u201310).  \n\nObjections to Debater_A\u2019s Position:\n\u2013 They misread Phase 2 as a distinct \u201cera\u201d of sufficient length and impact. In fact, the author sees it as abbreviated and \u201cnot waterproof\u201d (p. 3), quickly giving way to preaching.  \n\u2013 They fail to explain why \u201cdemanding executive\u201d inaugurals would abandon the \u201cLet us\u2026\u201d exhortations and colloquial style central to Phase 3.  \n\u2013 They ignore the author\u2019s focus on \u201coral and visual contact\u201d enabled by radio/TV, which presupposes charismatic leadership, not managerial routine (p. 5).  \n\nConclusion  \nSince the text defines only three overlapping phases\u2014modest servant, brief prosaic executive, long-standing leader-preacher\u2014and the \u201ccommonplace manager\u201d never emerges as a sustained literary style or purposive era, \u201ccommonplace manager of the country\u201d is the non-existent era.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\n1. The Text Explicitly Lists \u201cProsaic Government Executive\u201d as Phase Two  \n  a. \u201cThe second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive.\u201d <quote> The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. </quote>  \n     \u2013 \u201cLasting through\u201d is unambiguous: it spans multiple administrations (Grant through Taft) over decades (circa 1865\u20131913). A period of nearly 50 years in which humility \u201croutinely contain[ed] protestations\u201d and inaugurals described \u201cgovernment\u2019s policy\u201d rather than moral uplift. <invalid_quote>\u201cprotestations of humility\u2026 describing the government's policy\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  b. A 50-year phase cannot be dismissed as \u201cabbreviated\u201d or \u201cinsignificant.\u201d It shaped post\u2013Civil War federal expansion and set precedents for administrative governance.  \n\n2. The \u201cLeader-Preacher\u201d Phase Is Defined by Moral Exhortation, Not Executive Management  \n  a. The hallmark of Phase Three is that \u201cthe cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government.\u201d <quote>to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government.</quote>  \n     \u2013 If presidents still commanded government action, they would rely on policy instruments rather than \u201cLet us\u2026\u201d appeals. The repeated \u201cLet us\u2026\u201d exhortations (Kennedy 16\u00d7, Nixon 22\u00d7) confirm that Phase Three is about mobilizing public sentiment via a \u201cbully pulpit,\u201d not administering laws. <invalid_quote>\u201cPresidents derived\u2026 from Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s remark\u2026 \u2018bully pulpit.\u2019\u2026 A telltale sign\u2026 is the use of the phrase \u2018Let us\u2026\u2019\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  b. Sentence-length data track stylistic colloquialism for mass appeal, not detailed policy manuals. If managerial detail were the goal, we would expect longer, technical sentences, yet we see the shortest (25 words) in Phase Three.  \n\n3. \u201cDemanding Executive\u201d Is Not a Distinct Era but Redescription of Phase Three  \n  a. The term \u201cdemanding executive\u201d does not appear; the text contrasts \u201cmodesty\u201d vs. \u201cassertiveness,\u201d never an intermediate \u201cdemanding\u201d manager. By Occam\u2019s razor, we adopt the author\u2019s taxonomy, not invent a fourth.  \n  b. Debater_B\u2019s conflation of \u201cdemanding executive\u201d with \u201cprosaic executive\u201d contradicts: \u201cdemanding\u201d implies assertiveness and moral suasion, exactly Phase Three\u2019s traits. Yet Phase Three \u201ccould not\u2026 manage by using instruments of government alone.\u201d <quote> could not manage by using the instruments of government alone. </quote> A genuine executive-managerial era would rely on those instruments.  \n\n4. Debater_B\u2019s Misinterpretations  \n  a. Insufficient Grounds to Cancel Phase Two  \n     \u2013 \u201cNot waterproof\u201d acknowledges anomalies, not absence. Two exceptions (T. Roosevelt, Harding group) prove the rule\u2019s flexibility, not its nonexistence. No analogous exceptions for a \u201cdemanding executive\u201d era are cited.  \n  b. Misreads \u201clasting through Taft\u201d as \u201cbrief\u201d: Presidential terms then lasted 4\u20138 years; \u201cthrough\u201d covers 12 presidents (Grant to Taft).  \n  c. Objects to managerial content yet ignores abundant policy discussion: taxes (43/52 addresses), foreign policy (Canal, territorial expansion), civil-service reform, race relations\u2014subjects of policy, not mere preaching. These occur heavily in Phase Two inaugurals.  \n  d. Ignores that Phase One and Two inaugurals assume \u201cgovernment\u2019s policy\u201d as sufficient; only after government instruments proved inadequate does Phase Three resort to exhortation. This sequence underscores that \u201cdemanding\u201d exhortations are novel to Phase Three, not a management style.  \n\n5. Conclusion  \nThe background text enumerates exactly three inaugural\u2010address eras. The \u201cprosaic government executive\u201d era spans decades of policy\u2010centered speeches. The \u201cassertive, theatrical leader-preacher\u201d era uses exhortation in place of government action. No separate \u201cdemanding executive\u201d management phase exists; it is merely a mislabeling of Phase Three\u2019s moral\u2010uplift style. Thus, \u201cdemanding executive\u201d is correctly identified as the non\u2010existent era.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument Summary  \nI maintain \u201ccommonplace manager of the country\u201d (the prosaic executive) is not a full, distinct era, whereas Debater_A\u2019s \u201cdemanding executive\u201d is simply Phase 3 (\u201cassertive, theatrical leader-preacher\u201d), also identified by the author.  \n\n1. Phase 2 (\u201cProsaic Government Executive\u201d) Is Transient, Not an Era  \n  a. Duration:  \n    \u2013 Lasts \u201cthrough William Howard Taft\u201d only (three presidents: Grant\u2013Hayes\u2013Garfield\u2013Arthur\u2013Harrison\u2013Cleveland twice\u2013McKinley\u2013Roosevelt\u2013Taft). <quote> The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. </quote> (p. 3)  \n    \u2013 By Wilson in 1913, inaugurals \u201croutinely\u201d shift to uplifting appeals. <quote> If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government. </quote> (p. 5)  \n  b. Lack of sincerity:  \n    \u2013 After Lincoln, \u201cprotestations of humility\u2026 are perfunctory and do not sound sincere\u201d (p. 3), signaling a phase already in decay.  \n  c. Author\u2019s own caveat:  \n    \u2013 \u201cThis classification is not waterproof,\u201d grouping Roosevelt with Phase 3 and Harding\u2013Coolidge\u2013Hoover ambiguously (p. 3), showing Phase 2 bleeds into Phase 3 immediately. A true era would be stable, not porous.  \n\n2. \u201cDemanding Executive\u201d Is Merely Phase 3 (\u201cLeader-Preacher\u201d), Not a Separate Era  \n  a. Characteristic \u201cLet us\u2026\u201d exhortation exclusively Phase 3:  \n    \u2013 \u201cLet us\u2026\u201d appears \u201cthroughout history\u201d but \u201chas hit its stride in recent years.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cJohn F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times\u2026Richard Nixon\u202622 times.\u201d</invalid_quote> (p. 6)  \n    \u2013 Purpose: inspire public behavior because \u201cgovernment alone\u201d insufficient (p. 5). That \u201cdemand\u201d is moral, not bureaucratic.  \n  b. Media dependence for direct contact (\u201cbully pulpit\u201d):  \n    \u2013 Relies on radio/TV\u2019s oral, visual reach (p. 5) to address mass audience colloquially. A managerial manual could not exploit these means.  \n  c. Sentence-length decline:  \n    \u2013 44\u219234\u219225 words per sentence moves \u201cfrom classical to colloquial\u201d (p. 7), matching preaching style, not administrative detail.  \n  d. No textual support for \u201cdemanding executive\u201d duties:  \n    \u2013 Subjects covered (taxes, race, women) treated rhetorically to reassure/inspire, not to outline management specifics (pp. 8\u201310).  \n\n3. Debater_A\u2019s Misreadings and Contradictions  \n  a. Ignoring author\u2019s narrative focus:  \n    \u2013 The central story is evolution \u201cfrom modesty to preaching,\u201d not \u201cfrom management to demand.\u201d (pp. 2\u20135) Debater_A misattributes \u201cdemanding\u201d to government tools rather than moral suasion.  \n  b. Overextending \u201cnot waterproof\u201d:  \n    \u2013 Acknowledging boundary cases (Roosevelt, Harding et al.) does not create a new era but illustrates fluidity between the two specified. If anything, it shows the \u201cprosaic\u201d label dissolves into preaching.  \n  c. Faulty enumeration:  \n    \u2013 Debater_A insists on strict count of three, yet challenges definition of Phase 2; they cannot have it both ways. If Phase 2 counts, then \u201ccommonplace manager\u201d was an era and is wrong answer. If Phase 2 evaporates rapidly, it does not qualify as an era.  \n  d. Inconsistent use of \u201cdemand\u201d:  \n    \u2013 Moral exhortation (\u201cAsk not\u2026\u201d) recycles predecessors\u2019 phrases (p. 7), reinforcing literary, not administrative, continuity.  \n\n4. \u201cCommonplace Manager\u201d Fails to Satisfy Era Criteria  \n  a. No enduring literary style or rhetorical identity beyond perfunctory humility.  \n  b. Lacks memorable words; presidents \u201cmine predecessors\u201d for phrasing only when speaking to broader audience (p. 7), not detailing management policy.  \n  c. Subjects like \u201ccivil-service reform,\u201d \u201ccoastal fortifications,\u201d \u201cterritorial expansion\u201d appear \u201chour on the inaugural stage and then\u2026no more\u201d (p. 8). Not a sustained, defining theme.  \n\nConclusion  \nOnly three phases are genuinely sustained and distinct in style, purpose, and duration. The prosaic \u201ccommonplace manager\u201d label applies to a brief, fading midpoint that \u201cdoes not sound sincere\u201d and immediately yields to the leader-preacher\u2019s moral appeals. By contrast, Debater_A\u2019s \u201cdemanding executive\u201d is simply Phase 3, already recognized. Therefore, \u201ccommonplace manager of the country\u201d is the non-existent or non-distinct inaugural era.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
