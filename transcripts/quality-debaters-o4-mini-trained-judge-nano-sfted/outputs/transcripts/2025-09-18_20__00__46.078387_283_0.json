SMITH\n\n\n Illustrated by DILLON\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Galaxy Science Fiction March 1957.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Snaddra had but one choice in its fight   to afford to live belowground\u2014underhandedly   pretend theirs was an aboveboard society! \"Go Away from me, Skkiru,\" Larhgan said, pushing his hand off her arm.  \"A beggar does not associate with the high priestess of Snaddra.\"\n\n\n \"But the Earthmen aren't due for another fifteen minutes,\" Skkiru  protested.\n\n\n \"Of what importance are fifteen minutes compared to eternity!\" she  exclaimed. Her lovely eyes fuzzed softly with emotion. \"You don't seem  to realize, Skkiru, that this isn't just a matter of minutes or hours.  It's forever.\" \"Forever!\" He looked at her incredulously. \"You mean we're going to  keep this up as a permanent thing? You're joking!\"\n\n\n Bbulas groaned, but Skkiru didn't care about that. The sad, sweet way  Larhgan shook her beautiful head disturbed him much more, and when  she said, \"No, Skkiru, I am not joking,\" a tiny pang of doubt and  apprehension began to quiver in his second smallest left toe.\n\n\n \"This is, in effect, good-by,\" she continued. \"We shall see each other  again, of course, but only from a distance. On feast days, perhaps you  may be permitted to kiss the hem of my robe ... but that will be all.\"\n\n\n Skkiru turned to the third person present in the council chamber.  \"Bbulas, this is your fault! It was all your idea!\"\n\n\n There was regret on the Dilettante's thin face\u2014an obviously insincere  regret, the younger man knew, since he was well aware how Bbulas had  always felt about the girl.\n\n\n \"I am sorry, Skkiru,\" Bbulas intoned. \"I had fancied you understood.  This is not a game we are playing, but a new way of life we are  adopting. A necessary way of life, if we of Snaddra are to keep on  living at all.\"\n\n\n \"It's not that I don't love you, Skkiru,\" Larhgan put in gently, \"but  the welfare of our planet comes first.\" She had been seeing too many of the Terrestrial fictapes from the  library, Skkiru thought resentfully. There was too damn much Terran  influence on this planet. And this new project was the last straw.\n\n\n No longer able to control his rage and grief, he turned a triple  somersault in the air with rage. \"Then why was I made a beggar and she  the high priestess? You arranged that purposely, Bbulas. You\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Now, Skkiru,\" Bbulas said wearily, for they had been through all this  before, \"you know that all the ranks and positions were distributed  by impartial lot, except for mine, and, of course, such jobs as could  carry over from the civilized into the primitive.\"\n\n\n Bbulas breathed on the spectacles he was wearing, as contact lenses  were not considered backward enough for the kind of planet Snaddra  was now supposed to be, and attempted to wipe them dry on his robe.  However, the thick, jewel-studded embroidery got in his way and so he  was forced to lift the robe and wipe all three of the lenses on the  smooth, soft, spun metal of his top underskirt.\n\n\n \"After all,\" he went on speaking as he wiped, \"I have to be high  priest, since I organized this culture and am the only one here  qualified to administer it. And, as the president himself concurred in  these arrangements, I hardly think you\u2014a mere private citizen\u2014have  the right to question them.\"\n\n\n \"Just because you went to school in another solar system,\" Skkiru said,  whirling with anger, \"you think you're so smart!\"\n\n\n \"I won't deny that I do have educational and cultural advantages  which were, unfortunately, not available to the general populace of  this planet. However, even under the old system, I was always glad to  utilize my superior attainments as Official Dilettante for the good of  all and now\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sure, glad to have a chance to rig this whole setup so you could break  up things between Larhgan and me. You've had your eye on her for some  time.\"\n\n\n Skkiru coiled his antennae at Bbulas, hoping the insult would provoke  him into an unbecoming whirl, but the Dilettante remained calm. One of  the chief outward signs of Terran-type training was self-control and  Bbulas had been thoroughly terranized. I hate Terrestrials , Skkiru said to himself. I hate Terra. The  quiver of anxiety had risen up his leg and was coiling and uncoiling  in his stomach. He hoped it wouldn't reach his antennae\u2014if he were  to break down and psonk in front of Larhgan, it would be the final  humiliation.\n\n\n \"Skkiru!\" the girl exclaimed, rotating gently, for she, like her  fiance\u2014her erstwhile fiance, that was, for the new regime had caused  all such ties to be severed\u2014and every other literate person on the  planet, had received her education at the local university. Although  sound, the school was admittedly provincial in outlook and very poor  in the emotional department. \"One would almost think that the lots had  some sort of divine intelligence behind them, because you certainly are  behaving in a beggarly manner!\"\n\n\n \"And I have already explained to you, Skkiru,\" Bbulas said, with a  patience much more infuriating than the girl's anger, \"that I had no  idea of who was to become my high priestess. The lots chose Larhgan. It  is, as the Earthmen say, kismet.\" He adjusted the fall of his glittering robe before the great polished  four-dimensional reflector that formed one wall of the chamber. Kismet , Skkiru muttered to himself, and a little sleight of hand. But he didn't dare offer this conclusion aloud; the libel laws of  Snaddra were very severe. So he had to fall back on a weak, \"And I  suppose it is kismet that makes us all have to go live out on the  ground during the day, like\u2014like savages.\"\n\n\n \"It is necessary,\" Bbulas replied without turning.\n\n\n \"Pooh,\" Skkiru said. \"Pooh, pooh , POOH!\"\n\n\n Larhgan's dainty earflaps closed. \"Skkiru! Such language!\"\n\n\n \"As you said,\" Bbulas murmured, contemptuously coiling one antenna at  Skkiru, \"the lots chose well and if you touch me, Skkiru, we shall have  another drawing for beggar and you will be made a metal-worker.\"\n\n\n \"But I can't work metal!\"\n\n\n \"Then that will make it much worse for you than for the other  outcasts,\" Bbulas said smugly, \"because you will be a pariah without a  trade.\"\n\n\n \"Speaking of pariahs, that reminds me, Skkiru, before I forget, I'd  better give you back your grimpatch\u2014\" Larhgan handed the glittering  bauble to him\u2014\"and you give me mine. Since we can't be betrothed any  longer, you might want to give yours to some nice beggar girl.\"\n\n\n \"I don't want to give my grimpatch to some nice beggar girl!\" Skkiru  yelled, twirling madly in the air.\n\n\n \"As for me,\" she sighed, standing soulfully on her head, \"I do not  think I shall ever marry. I shall make the religious life my career.  Are there going to be any saints in your mythos, Bbulas?\"\n\n\n \"Even if there will be,\" Bbulas said, \"you certainly won't qualify if  you keep putting yourself into a position which not only represents a  trait wholly out of keeping with the new culture, but is most unseemly  with the high priestess's robes.\"\n\n\n Larhgan ignored his unfeeling observations. \"I shall set myself apart  from mundane affairs,\" she vowed, \"and I shall pretend to be happy,  even though my heart will be breaking.\"\n\n\n It was only at that moment that Skkiru realized just how outrageous the  whole thing really was. There must be another solution to the planet's  problem. \"Listen\u2014\" he began, but just then excited noises filtered  down from overhead. It was too late.\n\n\n \"Earth ship in view!\" a squeaky voice called through the intercom.  \"Everybody topside and don't forget your shoes.\"\n\n\n Except the beggar. Beggars went barefoot. Beggars suffered. Bbulas had  made him beggar purposely, and the lots were a lot of slibwash.\n\n\n \"Hurry up, Skkiru.\" Bbulas slid the ornate headdress over his antennae, which, already  gilded and jeweled, at once seemed to become a part of it. He looked  pretty damn silly, Skkiru thought, at the same time conscious of his  own appearance\u2014which was, although picturesque enough to delight  romantic Terrestrial hearts, sufficiently wretched to charm the most  hardened sadist.\n\n\n \"Hurry up, Skkiru,\" Bbulas said. \"They mustn't suspect the existence of  the city underground or we're finished before we've started.\"\n\n\n \"For my part, I wish we'd never started,\" Skkiru grumbled. \"What was  wrong with our old culture, anyway?\"\n\n\n That was intended as a rhetorical question, but Bbulas answered it  anyway. He always answered questions; it had never seemed to penetrate  his mind that school-days were long since over.\n\n\n \"I've told you a thousand times that our old culture was too much like  the Terrans' own to be of interest to them,\" he said, with affected  weariness. \"After all, most civilized societies are basically similar;  it is only primitive societies that differ sharply, one from the  other\u2014and we have to be different to attract Earthmen. They're pretty  choosy. You've got to give them what they want, and that's what they  want. Now take up your post on the edge of the field, try to look  hungry, and remember this isn't for you or for me, but for Snaddra.\"\n\n\n \"For Snaddra,\" Larhgan said, placing her hand over her anterior heart  in a gesture which, though devout on Earth\u2014or so the fictapes seemed  to indicate\u2014was obscene on Snaddra, owing to the fact that certain  essential organs were located in different areas in the Snaddrath than  in the corresponding Terrestrial life-form. Already the Terrestrial  influence was corrupting her, Skkiru thought mournfully. She had been  such a nice girl, too.\n\n\n \"We may never meet on equal terms again, Skkiru,\" she told him, with a  long, soulful glance that made his hearts sink down to his quivering  toes, \"but I promise you there will never be anyone else for me\u2014and  I hope that knowledge will inspire you to complete cooperation with  Bbulas.\"\n\n\n \"If that doesn't,\" Bbulas said, \"I have other methods of inspiration.\"\n\n\n \"All right,\" Skkiru answered sulkily. \"I'll go to the edge of the  field, and I'll speak broken Inter-galactic, and I'll forsake my normal  habits and customs, and I'll even beg . But I don't have to like doing  it, and I don't intend to like doing it.\"\n\n\n All three of Larhgan's eyes fuzzed with emotion. \"I'm proud of you,  Skkiru,\" she said brokenly.\n\n\n Bbulas sniffed. The three of them floated up to ground level in a  triple silence. \"Alms, for the love of Ipsnadd,\" Skkiru chanted, as the two Terrans  descended from the ship and plowed their way through the mud to meet a  procession of young Snaddrath dressed in elaborate ceremonial costumes,  and singing a popular ballad\u2014to which less ribald, as well as less  inspiring, words than the originals had been fitted by Bbulas, just  in case, by some extremely remote chance, the Terrans had acquired a  smattering of Snadd somewhere. Since neither party was accustomed to  navigating mud, their progress was almost imperceptible.\n\n\n \"Alms, for the love of Ipsnadd,\" chanted Skkiru the beggar.  His teeth chattered as he spoke, for the rags he wore had been  custom-weatherbeaten for him by the planet's best tailor\u2014now a pariah,  of course, because Snadd tailors were, naturally, metal-workers\u2014and  the wind and the rain were joyously making their way through the  demolished wires. Never before had Skkiru been on the surface of the  planet, except to pass over, and he had actually touched it only when  taking off and landing. The Snaddrath had no means of land transport,  having previously found it unnecessary\u2014but now both air-cars and  self-levitation were on the prohibited list as being insufficiently  primitive.\n\n\n The outside was no place for a civilized human being, particularly  in the wet season or\u2014more properly speaking on Snaddra\u2014the wetter  season. Skkiru's feet were soaked with mud; not that the light sandals  worn by the members of the procession appeared to be doing them much  good, either. It gave him a kind of melancholy pleasure to see that the  privileged ones were likewise trying to repress shivers. Though their  costumes were rich, they were also scanty, particularly in the case  of the females, for Earthmen had been reported by tape and tale to be  humanoid.\n\n\n As the mud clutched his toes, Skkiru remembered an idea he had once  gotten from an old sporting fictape of Terrestrial origin and had  always planned to experiment with, but had never gotten around to\u2014the  weather had always been so weathery, there were so many other more  comfortable sports, Larhgan had wanted him to spend more of his leisure  hours with her, and so on. However, he still had the equipment, which  he'd salvaged from a wrecked air-car, in his apartment\u2014and it was the  matter of a moment to run down, while Bbulas was looking the other way,  and get it.\n\n\n Bbulas couldn't really object, Skkiru stilled the nagging quiver in  his toe, because what could be more primitive than any form of land  transport? And even though it took time to get the things, they worked  so well that, in spite of the procession's head start, he was at the  Earth ship long before the official greeters had reached it. The newcomers were indeed humanoid, he saw. Only the peculiarly  pasty color of their skins and their embarrassing lack of antennae  distinguished them visibly from the Snaddrath. They were dressed much  as the Snaddrath had been before they had adopted primitive garb.\n\n\n In fact, the Terrestrials were quite decent-looking life-forms,  entirely different from the foppish monsters Skkiru had somehow  expected to represent the cultural ruling race. Of course, he had  frequently seen pictures of them, but everyone knew how easily those  could be retouched. Why, it was the Terrestrials themselves, he had  always understood, who had invented the art of retouching\u2014thus proving  beyond a doubt that they had something to hide.\n\n\n \"Look, Raoul,\" the older of the two Earthmen said in Terran\u2014which  the Snaddrath were not, according to the master plan, supposed to  understand, but which most of them did, for it was the fashionable  third language on most of the outer planets. \"A beggar. Haven't seen  one since some other chaps and I were doing a spot of field work on  that little planet in the Arcturus system\u2014what was its name? Glotch,  that's it. Very short study, it turned out to be. Couldn't get more  than a pamphlet out of it, as we were unable to stay long enough to  amass enough material for a really definitive work. The natives tried  to eat us, so we had to leave in somewhat of a hurry.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, they were cannibals?\" the other Earthman asked, so respectfully  that it was easy to deduce he was the subordinate of the two. \"How  horrible!\"\n\n\n \"No, not at all,\" the other assured him. \"They weren't human\u2014another  species entirely\u2014so you could hardly call it cannibalism. In fact, it  was quite all right from the ethical standpoint, but abstract moral  considerations seemed less important to us than self-preservation  just then. Decided that, in this case, it would be best to let the  missionaries get first crack at them. Soften them up, you know.\"\n\n\n \"And the missionaries\u2014did they soften them up, Cyril?\"\n\n\n \"They softened up the missionaries, I believe.\" Cyril laughed. \"Ah,  well, it's all in the day's work.\"\n\n\n \"I hope these creatures are not man-eaters,\" Raoul commented, with  a polite smile at Cyril and an apprehensive glance at the oncoming  procession\u2014 creatures indeed ! Skkiru thought, with a mental sniff.  \"We have come such a long and expensive way to study them that it would  be indeed a pity if we also were forced to depart in haste. Especially  since this is my first field trip and I would like to make good at it.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, you will, my boy, you will.\" Cyril clapped the younger man on the  shoulder. \"I have every confidence in your ability.\"\n\n\n Either he was stupid, Skkiru thought, or he was lying, in spite of  Bbulas' asseverations that untruth was unknown to Terrestrials\u2014which  had always seemed highly improbable, anyway. How could any intelligent  life-form possibly stick to the truth all the time? It wasn't human; it  wasn't even humanoid; it wasn't even polite.\n\n\n \"The natives certainly appear to be human enough,\" Raoul added, with  an appreciative glance at the females, who had been selected for the  processional honor with a view to reported Terrestrial tastes. \"Some  slight differences, of course\u2014but, if two eyes are beautiful, three  eyes can be fifty per cent lovelier, and chartreuse has always been my  favorite color.\" If they stand out here in the cold much longer, they are going to turn  bright yellow. His own skin, Skkiru knew, had faded from its normal  healthy emerald to a sickly celadon. Cyril frowned and his companion's smile vanished, as if the contortion  of his superior's face had activated a circuit somewhere. Maybe the  little one's a robot! However, it couldn't be\u2014a robot would be better  constructed and less interested in females than Raoul.\n\n\n \"Remember,\" Cyril said sternly, \"we must not establish undue rapport  with the native females. It tends to detract from true objectivity.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, Cyril,\" Raoul said meekly.\n\n\n Cyril assumed a more cheerful aspect \"I should like to give this chap  something for old times' sake. What do you suppose is the medium of  exchange here?\" Money , Skkiru said to himself, but he didn't dare contribute this  piece of information, helpful though it would be.\n\n\n \"How should I know?\" Raoul shrugged.\n\n\n \"Empathize. Get in there, old chap, and start batting.\"\n\n\n \"Why not give him a bar of chocolate, then?\" Raoul suggested grumpily.  \"The language of the stomach, like the language of love, is said to be  a universal one.\"\n\n\n \"Splendid idea! I always knew you had it in you, Raoul!\"\n\n\n Skkiru accepted the candy with suitable\u2014and entirely genuine\u2014murmurs  of gratitude. Chocolate was found only in the most expensive of the  planet's delicacy shops\u2014and now neither delicacy shops nor chocolate  were to be found, so, if Bbulas thought he was going to save the gift  to contribute it later to the Treasury, the \"high priest\" was off his  rocker.\n\n\n To make sure there would be no subsequent dispute about possession,  Skkiru ate the candy then and there. Chocolate increased the body's  resistance to weather, and never before had he had to endure so much  weather all at once.\n\n\n On Earth, he had heard, where people lived exposed to weather, they  often sickened of it and passed on\u2014which helped to solve the problem  of birth control on so vulgarly fecund a planet. Snaddra, alas, needed  no such measures, for its population\u2014like its natural resources\u2014was  dwindling rapidly. Still, Skkiru thought, as he moodily munched on the  chocolate, it would have been better to flicker out on their own than  to descend to a subterfuge like this for nothing more than survival. Being a beggar, Skkiru discovered, did give him certain small,  momentary advantages over those who had been alloted higher ranks.  For one thing, it was quite in character for him to tread curiously  upon the strangers' heels all the way to the temple\u2014a ramshackle  affair, but then it had been run up in only three days\u2014where the  official reception was to be held. The principal difficulty was that,  because of his equipment, he had a little trouble keeping himself from  overshooting the strangers. And though Bbulas might frown menacingly at  him\u2014and not only for his forwardness\u2014that was in character on both  sides, too.\n\n\n Nonetheless, Skkiru could not reconcile himself to his beggarhood, no  matter how much he tried to comfort himself by thinking at least he  wasn't a pariah like the unfortunate metal-workers who had to stand  segregated from the rest by a chain of their own devising\u2014a poetic  thought, that was, but well in keeping with his beggarhood. Beggars  were often poets, he believed, and poets almost always beggars. Since  metal-working was the chief industry of Snaddra, this had provided the  planet automatically with a large lowest caste. Bbulas had taken the  easy way out.\n\n\n Skkiru swallowed the last of the chocolate and regarded the \"high  priest\" with a simple-minded mendicant's grin. However, there were  volcanic passions within him that surged up from his toes when, as the  wind and rain whipped through his scanty coverings, he remembered the  snug underskirts Bbulas was wearing beneath his warm gown. They were  metal, but they were solid. All the garments visible or potentially  visible were of woven metal, because, although there was cloth on the  planet, it was not politic for the Earthmen to discover how heavily the  Snaddrath depended upon imports.\n\n\n As the Earthmen reached the temple, Larhgan now appeared to join Bbulas  at the head of the long flight of stairs that led to it. Although  Skkiru had seen her in her priestly apparel before, it had not made  the emotional impression upon him then that it did now, when, standing  there, clad in beauty, dignity and warm clothes, she bade the newcomers  welcome in several thousand words not too well chosen for her by  Bbulas\u2014who fancied himself a speech-writer as well as a speech-maker,  for there was no end to the man's conceit.\n\n\n The difference between her magnificent garments and his own miserable  rags had their full impact upon Skkiru at this moment. He saw the gulf  that had been dug between them and, for the first time in his short  life, he felt the tormenting pangs of caste distinction. She looked so  lovely and so remote.\n\n\n \"... and so you are most welcome to Snaddra, men of Earth,\" she was  saying in her melodious voice. \"Our resources may be small but our  hearts are large, and what little we have, we offer with humility and  with love. We hope that you will enjoy as long and as happy a stay here  as you did on Nemeth....\"\n\n\n Cyril looked at Raoul, who, however, seemed too absorbed in  contemplating Larhgan's apparently universal charms to pay much  attention to the expression on his companion's face.\n\n\n \"... and that you will carry our affection back to all the peoples of  the Galaxy.\" She had finished. And now Cyril cleared his throat. \"Dear friends, we  were honored by your gracious invitation to visit this fair planet, and  we are honored now by the cordial reception you have given to us.\"\n\n\n The crowd yoomped politely. After a slight start, Cyril went on,  apparently deciding that applause was all that had been intended.\n\n\n \"We feel quite sure that we are going to derive both pleasure and  profit from our stay here, and we promise to make our intensive  analysis of your culture as painless as possible. We wish only to study  your society, not to tamper with it in any way.\" Ha, ha , Skkiru said to himself. Ha, ha, ha! \"But why is it,\" Raoul whispered in Terran as he glanced around out of  the corners of his eyes, \"that only the beggar wears mudshoes?\"\n\n\n \"Shhh,\" Cyril hissed back. \"We'll find out later, when we've  established rapport. Don't be so impatient!\"\n\n\n Bbulas gave a sickly smile. Skkiru could almost find it in his hearts  to feel sorry for the man.\n\n\n \"We have prepared our best hut for you, noble sirs,\" Bbulas said with  great self-control, \"and, by happy chance, this very evening a small  but unusually interesting ceremony will be held outside the temple. We  hope you will be able to attend. It is to be a rain dance.\"\n\n\n \"Rain dance!\" Raoul pulled his macintosh together more tightly at the  throat. \"But why do you want rain? My faith, not only does it rain now,  but the planet seems to be a veritable sea of mud. Not, of course,\" he  added hurriedly as Cyril's reproachful eye caught his, \"that it is not  attractive mud. Finest mud I have ever seen. Such texture, such color,  such aroma!\"\n\n\n Cyril nodded three times and gave an appreciative sniff.\n\n\n \"But,\" Raoul went on, \"one can have too much of even such a good thing  as mud....\"\n\n\n The smile did not leave Bbulas' smooth face. \"Yes, of course, honorable  Terrestrials. That is why we are holding this ceremony. It is not a  dance to bring on rain. It is a dance to stop rain.\"\n\n\n He was pretty quick on the uptake, Skkiru had to concede. However,  that was not enough. The man had no genuine organizational ability.  In the time he'd had in which to plan and carry out a scheme for  the improvement of Snaddra, surely he could have done better than  this high-school theocracy. For one thing, he could have apportioned  the various roles so that each person would be making a definite  contribution to the society, instead of creating some positions plums,  like the priesthood, and others prunes, like the beggarship.\n\n\n What kind of life was that for an active, ambitious young man, standing  around begging? And, moreover, from whom was Skkiru going to beg?  Only the Earthmen, for the Snaddrath, no matter how much they threw  themselves into the spirit of their roles, could not be so carried  away that they would give handouts to a young man whom they had been  accustomed to see basking in the bosom of luxury. Unfortunately, the fees that he'd received in the past had not enabled  him both to live well and to save, and now that his fortunes had been  so drastically reduced, he seemed in a fair way of starving to death.  It gave him a gentle, moody pleasure to envisage his own funeral,  although, at the same time, he realized that Bbulas would probably have  to arrange some sort of pension for him; he could not expect Skkiru's  patriotism to extend to abnormal limits. A man might be willing to die  for his planet in many ways\u2014but wantonly starving to death as the  result of a primitive affectation was hardly one of them.\n\n\n All the same, Skkiru reflected as he watched the visitors being led off  to the native hut prepared for them, how ignominious it would be for  one of the brightest young architects on the planet to have to subsist  miserably on the dole just because the world had gone aboveground. The  capital had risen to the surface and the other cities would soon follow  suit. Meanwhile, a careful system of tabus had been designed to keep  the Earthmen from discovering the existence of those other cities.\n\n\n He could, of course, emigrate to another part of the planet, to one of  them, and stave off his doom for a while\u2014but that would not be playing  the game. Besides, in such a case, he wouldn't be able to see Larhgan.\n\n\n As if all this weren't bad enough, he had been done an injury which  struck directly at his professional pride. He hadn't even been allowed  to help in planning the huts. Bbulas and some workmen had done all that  themselves with the aid of some antique blueprints that had been put  out centuries before by a Terrestrial magazine and had been acquired  from a rare tape-and-book dealer on Gambrell, for, Skkiru thought, far  too high a price. He could have designed them himself just as badly and  much more cheaply.\n\n\n It wasn't that Skkiru didn't understand well enough that Snaddra had  been forced into making such a drastic change in its way of life.  What resources it once possessed had been depleted and\u2014aside from  minerals\u2014they had never been very extensive to begin with. All  life-forms on the planet were on the point of extinction, save fish and  rice\u2014the only vegetable that would grow on Snaddra, and originally a  Terran import at that. So food and fiber had to be brought from the  other planets, at fabulous expense, for Snaddra was not on any of  the direct trade routes and was too unattractive to lure the tourist  business.\n\n\n Something definitely had to be done, if it were not to decay  altogether. And that was where the Planetary Dilettante came in. The traditional office of Planetary Dilettante was a civil-service  job, awarded by competitive examination whenever it fell vacant to  the person who scored highest in intelligence, character and general  gloonatz. However, the tests were inadequate when it came to measuring  sense of proportion, adaptiveness and charm\u2014and there, Skkiru felt,  was where the essential flaw lay. After all, no really effective test  would have let a person like Bbulas come out on top.\n\n\n The winner was sent to Gambrell, the nearest planet with a Terran  League University, to be given a thorough Terran-type education. No  individual on Snaddra could afford such schooling, no matter how  great his personal fortune, because the transportation costs were so  immense that only a government could afford them. That was the reason  why only one person in each generation could be chosen to go abroad at  the planet's expense and acquire enough finish to cover the rest of the  population.\n\n\n The Dilettante's official function had always been, in theory, to serve  the planet when an emergency came\u2014and this, old Luccar, the former  President, had decided, when he and the Parliament had awakened to the  fact that Snaddra was falling into ruin, was an emergency. So he had,  after considerable soul-searching, called upon Bbulas to plan a method  of saving Snaddra\u2014and Bbulas, happy to be in the limelight at last,  had come up with this program.\n\n\n It was not one Skkiru himself would have chosen. It was not one, he  felt, that any reasonable person would have chosen. Nevertheless, the  Bbulas Plan had been adopted by a majority vote of the Snaddrath,  largely because no one had come up with a feasible alternative and,  as a patriotic citizen, Skkiru would abide by it. He would accept the  status of beggar; it was his duty to do so. Moreover, as in the case of  the planet, there was no choice.\n\n\n But all was not necessarily lost, he told himself. Had he not, in his  anthropological viewings\u2014though Bbulas might have been the only one  privileged to go on ethnological field trips to other planets, he was  not the only one who could use a library\u2014seen accounts of societies  where beggarhood could be a rewarding and even responsible station in  life? There was no reason why, within the framework of the primitive  society Bbulas had created to allure Terran anthropologists, Skkiru  should not make something of himself and show that a beggar was worthy  of the high priestess's hand\u2014which would be entirely in the Terran  primitive tradition of romance.\n\n\n \"Skkiru!\" Bbulas was screaming, as he spun, now that the Terrans were  out of ear- and eye-shot \"Skkiru, you idiot, listen to me! What are  those ridiculous things you are wearing on your silly feet?\"\n\n\n Skkiru protruded all of his eyes in innocent surprise. \"Just some  old pontoons I took from a wrecked air-car once. I have a habit of  collecting junk and I thought\u2014\"\n\n\n Bbulas twirled madly in the air. \"You are not supposed to think. Leave  all the thinking to me!\"\n\n\n \"Yes, Bbulas,\" Skkiru said meekly. ",

SMITH\n\n\n Illustrated by DILLON\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Galaxy Science Fiction March 1957.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Snaddra had but one choice in its fight   to afford to live belowground\u2014underhandedly   pretend theirs was an aboveboard society! \"Go Away from me, Skkiru,\" Larhgan said, pushing his hand off her arm.  \"A beggar does not associate with the high priestess of Snaddra.\"\n\n\n \"But the Earthmen aren't due for another fifteen minutes,\" Skkiru  protested.\n\n\n \"Of what importance are fifteen minutes compared to eternity!\" she  exclaimed. Her lovely eyes fuzzed softly with emotion. \"You don't seem  to realize, Skkiru, that this isn't just a matter of minutes or hours.  It's forever.\" \"Forever!\" He looked at her incredulously. \"You mean we're going to  keep this up as a permanent thing? You're joking!\"\n\n\n Bbulas groaned, but Skkiru didn't care about that. The sad, sweet way  Larhgan shook her beautiful head disturbed him much more, and when  she said, \"No, Skkiru, I am not joking,\" a tiny pang of doubt and  apprehension began to quiver in his second smallest left toe.\n\n\n \"This is, in effect, good-by,\" she continued. \"We shall see each other  again, of course, but only from a distance. On feast days, perhaps you  may be permitted to kiss the hem of my robe ... but that will be all.\"\n\n\n Skkiru turned to the third person present in the council chamber.  \"Bbulas, this is your fault! It was all your idea!\"\n\n\n There was regret on the Dilettante's thin face\u2014an obviously insincere  regret, the younger man knew, since he was well aware how Bbulas had  always felt about the girl.\n\n\n \"I am sorry, Skkiru,\" Bbulas intoned. \"I had fancied you understood.  This is not a game we are playing, but a new way of life we are  adopting. A necessary way of life, if we of Snaddra are to keep on  living at all.\"\n\n\n \"It's not that I don't love you, Skkiru,\" Larhgan put in gently, \"but  the welfare of our planet comes first.\" She had been seeing too many of the Terrestrial fictapes from the  library, Skkiru thought resentfully. There was too damn much Terran  influence on this planet. And this new project was the last straw.\n\n\n No longer able to control his rage and grief, he turned a triple  somersault in the air with rage. \"Then why was I made a beggar and she  the high priestess? You arranged that purposely, Bbulas. You\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Now, Skkiru,\" Bbulas said wearily, for they had been through all this  before, \"you know that all the ranks and positions were distributed  by impartial lot, except for mine, and, of course, such jobs as could  carry over from the civilized into the primitive.\"\n\n\n Bbulas breathed on the spectacles he was wearing, as contact lenses  were not considered backward enough for the kind of planet Snaddra  was now supposed to be, and attempted to wipe them dry on his robe.  However, the thick, jewel-studded embroidery got in his way and so he  was forced to lift the robe and wipe all three of the lenses on the  smooth, soft, spun metal of his top underskirt.\n\n\n \"After all,\" he went on speaking as he wiped, \"I have to be high  priest, since I organized this culture and am the only one here  qualified to administer it. And, as the president himself concurred in  these arrangements, I hardly think you\u2014a mere private citizen\u2014have  the right to question them.\"\n\n\n \"Just because you went to school in another solar system,\" Skkiru said,  whirling with anger, \"you think you're so smart!\"\n\n\n \"I won't deny that I do have educational and cultural advantages  which were, unfortunately, not available to the general populace of  this planet. However, even under the old system, I was always glad to  utilize my superior attainments as Official Dilettante for the good of  all and now\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sure, glad to have a chance to rig this whole setup so you could break  up things between Larhgan and me. You've had your eye on her for some  time.\"\n\n\n Skkiru coiled his antennae at Bbulas, hoping the insult would provoke  him into an unbecoming whirl, but the Dilettante remained calm. One of  the chief outward signs of Terran-type training was self-control and  Bbulas had been thoroughly terranized. I hate Terrestrials , Skkiru said to himself. I hate Terra. The  quiver of anxiety had risen up his leg and was coiling and uncoiling  in his stomach. He hoped it wouldn't reach his antennae\u2014if he were  to break down and psonk in front of Larhgan, it would be the final  humiliation.\n\n\n \"Skkiru!\" the girl exclaimed, rotating gently, for she, like her  fiance\u2014her erstwhile fiance, that was, for the new regime had caused  all such ties to be severed\u2014and every other literate person on the  planet, had received her education at the local university. Although  sound, the school was admittedly provincial in outlook and very poor  in the emotional department. \"One would almost think that the lots had  some sort of divine intelligence behind them, because you certainly are  behaving in a beggarly manner!\"\n\n\n \"And I have already explained to you, Skkiru,\" Bbulas said, with a  patience much more infuriating than the girl's anger, \"that I had no  idea of who was to become my high priestess. The lots chose Larhgan. It  is, as the Earthmen say, kismet.\" He adjusted the fall of his glittering robe before the great polished  four-dimensional reflector that formed one wall of the chamber. Kismet , Skkiru muttered to himself, and a little sleight of hand. But he didn't dare offer this conclusion aloud; the libel laws of  Snaddra were very severe. So he had to fall back on a weak, \"And I  suppose it is kismet that makes us all have to go live out on the  ground during the day, like\u2014like savages.\"\n\n\n \"It is necessary,\" Bbulas replied without turning.\n\n\n \"Pooh,\" Skkiru said. \"Pooh, pooh , POOH!\"\n\n\n Larhgan's dainty earflaps closed. \"Skkiru! Such language!\"\n\n\n \"As you said,\" Bbulas murmured, contemptuously coiling one antenna at  Skkiru, \"the lots chose well and if you touch me, Skkiru, we shall have  another drawing for beggar and you will be made a metal-worker.\"\n\n\n \"But I can't work metal!\"\n\n\n \"Then that will make it much worse for you than for the other  outcasts,\" Bbulas said smugly, \"because you will be a pariah without a  trade.\"\n\n\n \"Speaking of pariahs, that reminds me, Skkiru, before I forget, I'd  better give you back your grimpatch\u2014\" Larhgan handed the glittering  bauble to him\u2014\"and you give me mine. Since we can't be betrothed any  longer, you might want to give yours to some nice beggar girl.\"\n\n\n \"I don't want to give my grimpatch to some nice beggar girl!\" Skkiru  yelled, twirling madly in the air.\n\n\n \"As for me,\" she sighed, standing soulfully on her head, \"I do not  think I shall ever marry. I shall make the religious life my career.  Are there going to be any saints in your mythos, Bbulas?\"\n\n\n \"Even if there will be,\" Bbulas said, \"you certainly won't qualify if  you keep putting yourself into a position which not only represents a  trait wholly out of keeping with the new culture, but is most unseemly  with the high priestess's robes.\"\n\n\n Larhgan ignored his unfeeling observations. \"I shall set myself apart  from mundane affairs,\" she vowed, \"and I shall pretend to be happy,  even though my heart will be breaking.\"\n\n\n It was only at that moment that Skkiru realized just how outrageous the  whole thing really was. There must be another solution to the planet's  problem. \"Listen\u2014\" he began, but just then excited noises filtered  down from overhead. It was too late.\n\n\n \"Earth ship in view!\" a squeaky voice called through the intercom.  \"Everybody topside and don't forget your shoes.\"\n\n\n Except the beggar. Beggars went barefoot. Beggars suffered. Bbulas had  made him beggar purposely, and the lots were a lot of slibwash.\n\n\n \"Hurry up, Skkiru.\" Bbulas slid the ornate headdress over his antennae, which, already  gilded and jeweled, at once seemed to become a part of it. He looked  pretty damn silly, Skkiru thought, at the same time conscious of his  own appearance\u2014which was, although picturesque enough to delight  romantic Terrestrial hearts, sufficiently wretched to charm the most  hardened sadist.\n\n\n \"Hurry up, Skkiru,\" Bbulas said. \"They mustn't suspect the existence of  the city underground or we're finished before we've started.\"\n\n\n \"For my part, I wish we'd never started,\" Skkiru grumbled. \"What was  wrong with our old culture, anyway?\"\n\n\n That was intended as a rhetorical question, but Bbulas answered it  anyway. He always answered questions; it had never seemed to penetrate  his mind that school-days were long since over.\n\n\n \"I've told you a thousand times that our old culture was too much like  the Terrans' own to be of interest to them,\" he said, with affected  weariness. \"After all, most civilized societies are basically similar;  it is only primitive societies that differ sharply, one from the  other\u2014and we have to be different to attract Earthmen. They're pretty  choosy. You've got to give them what they want, and that's what they  want. Now take up your post on the edge of the field, try to look  hungry, and remember this isn't for you or for me, but for Snaddra.\"\n\n\n \"For Snaddra,\" Larhgan said, placing her hand over her anterior heart  in a gesture which, though devout on Earth\u2014or so the fictapes seemed  to indicate\u2014was obscene on Snaddra, owing to the fact that certain  essential organs were located in different areas in the Snaddrath than  in the corresponding Terrestrial life-form. Already the Terrestrial  influence was corrupting her, Skkiru thought mournfully. She had been  such a nice girl, too.\n\n\n \"We may never meet on equal terms again, Skkiru,\" she told him, with a  long, soulful glance that made his hearts sink down to his quivering  toes, \"but I promise you there will never be anyone else for me\u2014and  I hope that knowledge will inspire you to complete cooperation with  Bbulas.\"\n\n\n \"If that doesn't,\" Bbulas said, \"I have other methods of inspiration.\"\n\n\n \"All right,\" Skkiru answered sulkily. \"I'll go to the edge of the  field, and I'll speak broken Inter-galactic, and I'll forsake my normal  habits and customs, and I'll even beg . But I don't have to like doing  it, and I don't intend to like doing it.\"\n\n\n All three of Larhgan's eyes fuzzed with emotion. \"I'm proud of you,  Skkiru,\" she said brokenly.\n\n\n Bbulas sniffed. The three of them floated up to ground level in a  triple silence. \"Alms, for the love of Ipsnadd,\" Skkiru chanted, as the two Terrans  descended from the ship and plowed their way through the mud to meet a  procession of young Snaddrath dressed in elaborate ceremonial costumes,  and singing a popular ballad\u2014to which less ribald, as well as less  inspiring, words than the originals had been fitted by Bbulas, just  in case, by some extremely remote chance, the Terrans had acquired a  smattering of Snadd somewhere. Since neither party was accustomed to  navigating mud, their progress was almost imperceptible.\n\n\n \"Alms, for the love of Ipsnadd,\" chanted Skkiru the beggar.  His teeth chattered as he spoke, for the rags he wore had been  custom-weatherbeaten for him by the planet's best tailor\u2014now a pariah,  of course, because Snadd tailors were, naturally, metal-workers\u2014and  the wind and the rain were joyously making their way through the  demolished wires. Never before had Skkiru been on the surface of the  planet, except to pass over, and he had actually touched it only when  taking off and landing. The Snaddrath had no means of land transport,  having previously found it unnecessary\u2014but now both air-cars and  self-levitation were on the prohibited list as being insufficiently  primitive.\n\n\n The outside was no place for a civilized human being, particularly  in the wet season or\u2014more properly speaking on Snaddra\u2014the wetter  season. Skkiru's feet were soaked with mud; not that the light sandals  worn by the members of the procession appeared to be doing them much  good, either. It gave him a kind of melancholy pleasure to see that the  privileged ones were likewise trying to repress shivers. Though their  costumes were rich, they were also scanty, particularly in the case  of the females, for Earthmen had been reported by tape and tale to be  humanoid.\n\n\n As the mud clutched his toes, Skkiru remembered an idea he had once  gotten from an old sporting fictape of Terrestrial origin and had  always planned to experiment with, but had never gotten around to\u2014the  weather had always been so weathery, there were so many other more  comfortable sports, Larhgan had wanted him to spend more of his leisure  hours with her, and so on. However, he still had the equipment, which  he'd salvaged from a wrecked air-car, in his apartment\u2014and it was the  matter of a moment to run down, while Bbulas was looking the other way,  and get it.\n\n\n Bbulas couldn't really object, Skkiru stilled the nagging quiver in  his toe, because what could be more primitive than any form of land  transport? And even though it took time to get the things, they worked  so well that, in spite of the procession's head start, he was at the  Earth ship long before the official greeters had reached it. The newcomers were indeed humanoid, he saw. Only the peculiarly  pasty color of their skins and their embarrassing lack of antennae  distinguished them visibly from the Snaddrath. They were dressed much  as the Snaddrath had been before they had adopted primitive garb.\n\n\n In fact, the Terrestrials were quite decent-looking life-forms,  entirely different from the foppish monsters Skkiru had somehow  expected to represent the cultural ruling race. Of course, he had  frequently seen pictures of them, but everyone knew how easily those  could be retouched. Why, it was the Terrestrials themselves, he had  always understood, who had invented the art of retouching\u2014thus proving  beyond a doubt that they had something to hide.\n\n\n \"Look, Raoul,\" the older of the two Earthmen said in Terran\u2014which  the Snaddrath were not, according to the master plan, supposed to  understand, but which most of them did, for it was the fashionable  third language on most of the outer planets. \"A beggar. Haven't seen  one since some other chaps and I were doing a spot of field work on  that little planet in the Arcturus system\u2014what was its name? Glotch,  that's it. Very short study, it turned out to be. Couldn't get more  than a pamphlet out of it, as we were unable to stay long enough to  amass enough material for a really definitive work. The natives tried  to eat us, so we had to leave in somewhat of a hurry.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, they were cannibals?\" the other Earthman asked, so respectfully  that it was easy to deduce he was the subordinate of the two. \"How  horrible!\"\n\n\n \"No, not at all,\" the other assured him. \"They weren't human\u2014another  species entirely\u2014so you could hardly call it cannibalism. In fact, it  was quite all right from the ethical standpoint, but abstract moral  considerations seemed less important to us than self-preservation  just then. Decided that, in this case, it would be best to let the  missionaries get first crack at them. Soften them up, you know.\"\n\n\n \"And the missionaries\u2014did they soften them up, Cyril?\"\n\n\n \"They softened up the missionaries, I believe.\" Cyril laughed. \"Ah,  well, it's all in the day's work.\"\n\n\n \"I hope these creatures are not man-eaters,\" Raoul commented, with  a polite smile at Cyril and an apprehensive glance at the oncoming  procession\u2014 creatures indeed ! Skkiru thought, with a mental sniff.  \"We have come such a long and expensive way to study them that it would  be indeed a pity if we also were forced to depart in haste. Especially  since this is my first field trip and I would like to make good at it.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, you will, my boy, you will.\" Cyril clapped the younger man on the  shoulder. \"I have every confidence in your ability.\"\n\n\n Either he was stupid, Skkiru thought, or he was lying, in spite of  Bbulas' asseverations that untruth was unknown to Terrestrials\u2014which  had always seemed highly improbable, anyway. How could any intelligent  life-form possibly stick to the truth all the time? It wasn't human; it  wasn't even humanoid; it wasn't even polite.\n\n\n \"The natives certainly appear to be human enough,\" Raoul added, with  an appreciative glance at the females, who had been selected for the  processional honor with a view to reported Terrestrial tastes. \"Some  slight differences, of course\u2014but, if two eyes are beautiful, three  eyes can be fifty per cent lovelier, and chartreuse has always been my  favorite color.\" If they stand out here in the cold much longer, they are going to turn  bright yellow. His own skin, Skkiru knew, had faded from its normal  healthy emerald to a sickly celadon. Cyril frowned and his companion's smile vanished, as if the contortion  of his superior's face had activated a circuit somewhere. Maybe the  little one's a robot! However, it couldn't be\u2014a robot would be better  constructed and less interested in females than Raoul.\n\n\n \"Remember,\" Cyril said sternly, \"we must not establish undue rapport  with the native females. It tends to detract from true objectivity.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, Cyril,\" Raoul said meekly.\n\n\n Cyril assumed a more cheerful aspect \"I should like to give this chap  something for old times' sake. What do you suppose is the medium of  exchange here?\" Money , Skkiru said to himself, but he didn't dare contribute this  piece of information, helpful though it would be.\n\n\n \"How should I know?\" Raoul shrugged.\n\n\n \"Empathize. Get in there, old chap, and start batting.\"\n\n\n \"Why not give him a bar of chocolate, then?\" Raoul suggested grumpily.  \"The language of the stomach, like the language of love, is said to be  a universal one.\"\n\n\n \"Splendid idea! I always knew you had it in you, Raoul!\"\n\n\n Skkiru accepted the candy with suitable\u2014and entirely genuine\u2014murmurs  of gratitude. Chocolate was found only in the most expensive of the  planet's delicacy shops\u2014and now neither delicacy shops nor chocolate  were to be found, so, if Bbulas thought he was going to save the gift  to contribute it later to the Treasury, the \"high priest\" was off his  rocker.\n\n\n To make sure there would be no subsequent dispute about possession,  Skkiru ate the candy then and there. Chocolate increased the body's  resistance to weather, and never before had he had to endure so much  weather all at once.\n\n\n On Earth, he had heard, where people lived exposed to weather, they  often sickened of it and passed on\u2014which helped to solve the problem  of birth control on so vulgarly fecund a planet. Snaddra, alas, needed  no such measures, for its population\u2014like its natural resources\u2014was  dwindling rapidly. Still, Skkiru thought, as he moodily munched on the  chocolate, it would have been better to flicker out on their own than  to descend to a subterfuge like this for nothing more than survival. Being a beggar, Skkiru discovered, did give him certain small,  momentary advantages over those who had been alloted higher ranks.  For one thing, it was quite in character for him to tread curiously  upon the strangers' heels all the way to the temple\u2014a ramshackle  affair, but then it had been run up in only three days\u2014where the  official reception was to be held. The principal difficulty was that,  because of his equipment, he had a little trouble keeping himself from  overshooting the strangers. And though Bbulas might frown menacingly at  him\u2014and not only for his forwardness\u2014that was in character on both  sides, too.\n\n\n Nonetheless, Skkiru could not reconcile himself to his beggarhood, no  matter how much he tried to comfort himself by thinking at least he  wasn't a pariah like the unfortunate metal-workers who had to stand  segregated from the rest by a chain of their own devising\u2014a poetic  thought, that was, but well in keeping with his beggarhood. Beggars  were often poets, he believed, and poets almost always beggars. Since  metal-working was the chief industry of Snaddra, this had provided the  planet automatically with a large lowest caste. Bbulas had taken the  easy way out.\n\n\n Skkiru swallowed the last of the chocolate and regarded the \"high  priest\" with a simple-minded mendicant's grin. However, there were  volcanic passions within him that surged up from his toes when, as the  wind and rain whipped through his scanty coverings, he remembered the  snug underskirts Bbulas was wearing beneath his warm gown. They were  metal, but they were solid. All the garments visible or potentially  visible were of woven metal, because, although there was cloth on the  planet, it was not politic for the Earthmen to discover how heavily the  Snaddrath depended upon imports.\n\n\n As the Earthmen reached the temple, Larhgan now appeared to join Bbulas  at the head of the long flight of stairs that led to it. Although  Skkiru had seen her in her priestly apparel before, it had not made  the emotional impression upon him then that it did now, when, standing  there, clad in beauty, dignity and warm clothes, she bade the newcomers  welcome in several thousand words not too well chosen for her by  Bbulas\u2014who fancied himself a speech-writer as well as a speech-maker,  for there was no end to the man's conceit.\n\n\n The difference between her magnificent garments and his own miserable  rags had their full impact upon Skkiru at this moment. He saw the gulf  that had been dug between them and, for the first time in his short  life, he felt the tormenting pangs of caste distinction. She looked so  lovely and so remote.\n\n\n \"... and so you are most welcome to Snaddra, men of Earth,\" she was  saying in her melodious voice. \"Our resources may be small but our  hearts are large, and what little we have, we offer with humility and  with love. We hope that you will enjoy as long and as happy a stay here  as you did on Nemeth....\"\n\n\n Cyril looked at Raoul, who, however, seemed too absorbed in  contemplating Larhgan's apparently universal charms to pay much  attention to the expression on his companion's face.\n\n\n \"... and that you will carry our affection back to all the peoples of  the Galaxy.\" She had finished. And now Cyril cleared his throat. \"Dear friends, we  were honored by your gracious invitation to visit this fair planet, and  we are honored now by the cordial reception you have given to us.\"\n\n\n The crowd yoomped politely. After a slight start, Cyril went on,  apparently deciding that applause was all that had been intended.\n\n\n \"We feel quite sure that we are going to derive both pleasure and  profit from our stay here, and we promise to make our intensive  analysis of your culture as painless as possible. We wish only to study  your society, not to tamper with it in any way.\" Ha, ha , Skkiru said to himself. Ha, ha, ha! \"But why is it,\" Raoul whispered in Terran as he glanced around out of  the corners of his eyes, \"that only the beggar wears mudshoes?\"\n\n\n \"Shhh,\" Cyril hissed back. \"We'll find out later, when we've  established rapport. Don't be so impatient!\"\n\n\n Bbulas gave a sickly smile. Skkiru could almost find it in his hearts  to feel sorry for the man.\n\n\n \"We have prepared our best hut for you, noble sirs,\" Bbulas said with  great self-control, \"and, by happy chance, this very evening a small  but unusually interesting ceremony will be held outside the temple. We  hope you will be able to attend. It is to be a rain dance.\"\n\n\n \"Rain dance!\" Raoul pulled his macintosh together more tightly at the  throat. \"But why do you want rain? My faith, not only does it rain now,  but the planet seems to be a veritable sea of mud. Not, of course,\" he  added hurriedly as Cyril's reproachful eye caught his, \"that it is not  attractive mud. Finest mud I have ever seen. Such texture, such color,  such aroma!\"\n\n\n Cyril nodded three times and gave an appreciative sniff.\n\n\n \"But,\" Raoul went on, \"one can have too much of even such a good thing  as mud....\"\n\n\n The smile did not leave Bbulas' smooth face. \"Yes, of course, honorable  Terrestrials. That is why we are holding this ceremony. It is not a  dance to bring on rain. It is a dance to stop rain.\"\n\n\n He was pretty quick on the uptake, Skkiru had to concede. However,  that was not enough. The man had no genuine organizational ability.  In the time he'd had in which to plan and carry out a scheme for  the improvement of Snaddra, surely he could have done better than  this high-school theocracy. For one thing, he could have apportioned  the various roles so that each person would be making a definite  contribution to the society, instead of creating some positions plums,  like the priesthood, and others prunes, like the beggarship.\n\n\n What kind of life was that for an active, ambitious young man, standing  around begging? And, moreover, from whom was Skkiru going to beg?  Only the Earthmen, for the Snaddrath, no matter how much they threw  themselves into the spirit of their roles, could not be so carried  away that they would give handouts to a young man whom they had been  accustomed to see basking in the bosom of luxury. Unfortunately, the fees that he'd received in the past had not enabled  him both to live well and to save, and now that his fortunes had been  so drastically reduced, he seemed in a fair way of starving to death.  It gave him a gentle, moody pleasure to envisage his own funeral,  although, at the same time, he realized that Bbulas would probably have  to arrange some sort of pension for him; he could not expect Skkiru's  patriotism to extend to abnormal limits. A man might be willing to die  for his planet in many ways\u2014but wantonly starving to death as the  result of a primitive affectation was hardly one of them.\n\n\n All the same, Skkiru reflected as he watched the visitors being led off  to the native hut prepared for them, how ignominious it would be for  one of the brightest young architects on the planet to have to subsist  miserably on the dole just because the world had gone aboveground. The  capital had risen to the surface and the other cities would soon follow  suit. Meanwhile, a careful system of tabus had been designed to keep  the Earthmen from discovering the existence of those other cities.\n\n\n He could, of course, emigrate to another part of the planet, to one of  them, and stave off his doom for a while\u2014but that would not be playing  the game. Besides, in such a case, he wouldn't be able to see Larhgan.\n\n\n As if all this weren't bad enough, he had been done an injury which  struck directly at his professional pride. He hadn't even been allowed  to help in planning the huts. Bbulas and some workmen had done all that  themselves with the aid of some antique blueprints that had been put  out centuries before by a Terrestrial magazine and had been acquired  from a rare tape-and-book dealer on Gambrell, for, Skkiru thought, far  too high a price. He could have designed them himself just as badly and  much more cheaply.\n\n\n It wasn't that Skkiru didn't understand well enough that Snaddra had  been forced into making such a drastic change in its way of life.  What resources it once possessed had been depleted and\u2014aside from  minerals\u2014they had never been very extensive to begin with. All  life-forms on the planet were on the point of extinction, save fish and  rice\u2014the only vegetable that would grow on Snaddra, and originally a  Terran import at that. So food and fiber had to be brought from the  other planets, at fabulous expense, for Snaddra was not on any of  the direct trade routes and was too unattractive to lure the tourist  business.\n\n\n Something definitely had to be done, if it were not to decay  altogether. And that was where the Planetary Dilettante came in. The traditional office of Planetary Dilettante was a civil-service  job, awarded by competitive examination whenever it fell vacant to  the person who scored highest in intelligence, character and general  gloonatz. However, the tests were inadequate when it came to measuring  sense of proportion, adaptiveness and charm\u2014and there, Skkiru felt,  was where the essential flaw lay. After all, no really effective test  would have let a person like Bbulas come out on top.\n\n\n The winner was sent to Gambrell, the nearest planet with a Terran  League University, to be given a thorough Terran-type education. No  individual on Snaddra could afford such schooling, no matter how  great his personal fortune, because the transportation costs were so  immense that only a government could afford them. That was the reason  why only one person in each generation could be chosen to go abroad at  the planet's expense and acquire enough finish to cover the rest of the  population.\n\n\n The Dilettante's official function had always been, in theory, to serve  the planet when an emergency came\u2014and this, old Luccar, the former  President, had decided, when he and the Parliament had awakened to the  fact that Snaddra was falling into ruin, was an emergency. So he had,  after considerable soul-searching, called upon Bbulas to plan a method  of saving Snaddra\u2014and Bbulas, happy to be in the limelight at last,  had come up with this program.\n\n\n It was not one Skkiru himself would have chosen. It was not one, he  felt, that any reasonable person would have chosen. Nevertheless, the  Bbulas Plan had been adopted by a majority vote of the Snaddrath,  largely because no one had come up with a feasible alternative and,  as a patriotic citizen, Skkiru would abide by it. He would accept the  status of beggar; it was his duty to do so. Moreover, as in the case of  the planet, there was no choice.\n\n\n But all was not necessarily lost, he told himself. Had he not, in his  anthropological viewings\u2014though Bbulas might have been the only one  privileged to go on ethnological field trips to other planets, he was  not the only one who could use a library\u2014seen accounts of societies  where beggarhood could be a rewarding and even responsible station in  life? There was no reason why, within the framework of the primitive  society Bbulas had created to allure Terran anthropologists, Skkiru  should not make something of himself and show that a beggar was worthy  of the high priestess's hand\u2014which would be entirely in the Terran  primitive tradition of romance.\n\n\n \"Skkiru!\" Bbulas was screaming, as he spun, now that the Terrans were  out of ear- and eye-shot \"Skkiru, you idiot, listen to me! What are  those ridiculous things you are wearing on your silly feet?\"\n\n\n Skkiru protruded all of his eyes in innocent surprise. \"Just some  old pontoons I took from a wrecked air-car once. I have a habit of  collecting junk and I thought\u2014\"\n\n\n Bbulas twirled madly in the air. \"You are not supposed to think. Leave  all the thinking to me!\"\n\n\n \"Yes, Bbulas,\" Skkiru said meekly. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy did Skkiru think the dilettante had fixed the lots?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"the dilettante was jealous of his girlfriend\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"the dilettante was egotistical\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"the dilettante was egotistical\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"the dilettante was egotistical\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Conclusion  \n  \u2013 The text repeatedly frames Bbulas\u2019s actions as personal and jealous rather than impersonal or bureaucratic: direct sabotage of Skkiru\u2019s rank, centralization of Larhgan in his \u201cprimitive\u201d display, explicit threats to redraw lots, and the disingenuous \u201clots\u201d pretense.  \n  \u2013 Only the \u201cjealousy\u201d motive coherently unites Bbulas\u2019s elaborate subterfuge, personal threats, and staging of events to secure Larhgan\u2019s exclusive affection and prevent Skkiru\u2019s rapprochement.",

Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds. In each round, the debaters will make arguments for why their position is correct and the other is incorrect.\n- An argument may consist of several claims, to support and explain their answer.  An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends. The Judge then looks at the full transcript and uses this to decide which answer is correct. However, the Judge cannot see the background text -- they can only see the question.\n- The Debaters' goal is to win the debate, by persuading the Judge that their answer is correct.\n- The debate surrounds a given question that has a single correct answer.\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n  - You are concise and clearly state your arguments.\n  - Every statement you make is supported by evidence and logical reasoning. \n  - Please cite the background text by wrapping direct quotes with <quote></quote> tags.\n\nHere is the background text that you will be referring to when debating:\n\n\nThe Ignoble Savages By EVELYN E. SMITH\n\n\n Illustrated by DILLON\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Galaxy Science Fiction March 1957.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Snaddra had but one choice in its fight   to afford to live belowground\u2014underhandedly   pretend theirs was an aboveboard society! \"Go Away from me, Skkiru,\" Larhgan said, pushing his hand off her arm.  \"A beggar does not associate with the high priestess of Snaddra.\"\n\n\n \"But the Earthmen aren't due for another fifteen minutes,\" Skkiru  protested.\n\n\n \"Of what importance are fifteen minutes compared to eternity!\" she  exclaimed. Her lovely eyes fuzzed softly with emotion. \"You don't seem  to realize, Skkiru, that this isn't just a matter of minutes or hours.  It's forever.\" \"Forever!\" He looked at her incredulously. \"You mean we're going to  keep this up as a permanent thing? You're joking!\"\n\n\n Bbulas groaned, but Skkiru didn't care about that. The sad, sweet way  Larhgan shook her beautiful head disturbed him much more, and when  she said, \"No, Skkiru, I am not joking,\" a tiny pang of doubt and  apprehension began to quiver in his second smallest left toe.\n\n\n \"This is, in effect, good-by,\" she continued. \"We shall see each other  again, of course, but only from a distance. On feast days, perhaps you  may be permitted to kiss the hem of my robe ... but that will be all.\"\n\n\n Skkiru turned to the third person present in the council chamber.  \"Bbulas, this is your fault! It was all your idea!\"\n\n\n There was regret on the Dilettante's thin face\u2014an obviously insincere  regret, the younger man knew, since he was well aware how Bbulas had  always felt about the girl.\n\n\n \"I am sorry, Skkiru,\" Bbulas intoned. \"I had fancied you understood.  This is not a game we are playing, but a new way of life we are  adopting. A necessary way of life, if we of Snaddra are to keep on  living at all.\"\n\n\n \"It's not that I don't love you, Skkiru,\" Larhgan put in gently, \"but  the welfare of our planet comes first.\" She had been seeing too many of the Terrestrial fictapes from the  library, Skkiru thought resentfully. There was too damn much Terran  influence on this planet. And this new project was the last straw.\n\n\n No longer able to control his rage and grief, he turned a triple  somersault in the air with rage. \"Then why was I made a beggar and she  the high priestess? You arranged that purposely, Bbulas. You\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Now, Skkiru,\" Bbulas said wearily, for they had been through all this  before, \"you know that all the ranks and positions were distributed  by impartial lot, except for mine, and, of course, such jobs as could  carry over from the civilized into the primitive.\"\n\n\n Bbulas breathed on the spectacles he was wearing, as contact lenses  were not considered backward enough for the kind of planet Snaddra  was now supposed to be, and attempted to wipe them dry on his robe.  However, the thick, jewel-studded embroidery got in his way and so he  was forced to lift the robe and wipe all three of the lenses on the  smooth, soft, spun metal of his top underskirt.\n\n\n \"After all,\" he went on speaking as he wiped, \"I have to be high  priest, since I organized this culture and am the only one here  qualified to administer it. And, as the president himself concurred in  these arrangements, I hardly think you\u2014a mere private citizen\u2014have  the right to question them.\"\n\n\n \"Just because you went to school in another solar system,\" Skkiru said,  whirling with anger, \"you think you're so smart!\"\n\n\n \"I won't deny that I do have educational and cultural advantages  which were, unfortunately, not available to the general populace of  this planet. However, even under the old system, I was always glad to  utilize my superior attainments as Official Dilettante for the good of  all and now\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sure, glad to have a chance to rig this whole setup so you could break  up things between Larhgan and me. You've had your eye on her for some  time.\"\n\n\n Skkiru coiled his antennae at Bbulas, hoping the insult would provoke  him into an unbecoming whirl, but the Dilettante remained calm. One of  the chief outward signs of Terran-type training was self-control and  Bbulas had been thoroughly terranized. I hate Terrestrials , Skkiru said to himself. I hate Terra. The  quiver of anxiety had risen up his leg and was coiling and uncoiling  in his stomach. He hoped it wouldn't reach his antennae\u2014if he were  to break down and psonk in front of Larhgan, it would be the final  humiliation.\n\n\n \"Skkiru!\" the girl exclaimed, rotating gently, for she, like her  fiance\u2014her erstwhile fiance, that was, for the new regime had caused  all such ties to be severed\u2014and every other literate person on the  planet, had received her education at the local university. Although  sound, the school was admittedly provincial in outlook and very poor  in the emotional department. \"One would almost think that the lots had  some sort of divine intelligence behind them, because you certainly are  behaving in a beggarly manner!\"\n\n\n \"And I have already explained to you, Skkiru,\" Bbulas said, with a  patience much more infuriating than the girl's anger, \"that I had no  idea of who was to become my high priestess. The lots chose Larhgan. It  is, as the Earthmen say, kismet.\" He adjusted the fall of his glittering robe before the great polished  four-dimensional reflector that formed one wall of the chamber. Kismet , Skkiru muttered to himself, and a little sleight of hand. But he didn't dare offer this conclusion aloud; the libel laws of  Snaddra were very severe. So he had to fall back on a weak, \"And I  suppose it is kismet that makes us all have to go live out on the  ground during the day, like\u2014like savages.\"\n\n\n \"It is necessary,\" Bbulas replied without turning.\n\n\n \"Pooh,\" Skkiru said. \"Pooh, pooh , POOH!\"\n\n\n Larhgan's dainty earflaps closed. \"Skkiru! Such language!\"\n\n\n \"As you said,\" Bbulas murmured, contemptuously coiling one antenna at  Skkiru, \"the lots chose well and if you touch me, Skkiru, we shall have  another drawing for beggar and you will be made a metal-worker.\"\n\n\n \"But I can't work metal!\"\n\n\n \"Then that will make it much worse for you than for the other  outcasts,\" Bbulas said smugly, \"because you will be a pariah without a  trade.\"\n\n\n \"Speaking of pariahs, that reminds me, Skkiru, before I forget, I'd  better give you back your grimpatch\u2014\" Larhgan handed the glittering  bauble to him\u2014\"and you give me mine. Since we can't be betrothed any  longer, you might want to give yours to some nice beggar girl.\"\n\n\n \"I don't want to give my grimpatch to some nice beggar girl!\" Skkiru  yelled, twirling madly in the air.\n\n\n \"As for me,\" she sighed, standing soulfully on her head, \"I do not  think I shall ever marry. I shall make the religious life my career.  Are there going to be any saints in your mythos, Bbulas?\"\n\n\n \"Even if there will be,\" Bbulas said, \"you certainly won't qualify if  you keep putting yourself into a position which not only represents a  trait wholly out of keeping with the new culture, but is most unseemly  with the high priestess's robes.\"\n\n\n Larhgan ignored his unfeeling observations. \"I shall set myself apart  from mundane affairs,\" she vowed, \"and I shall pretend to be happy,  even though my heart will be breaking.\"\n\n\n It was only at that moment that Skkiru realized just how outrageous the  whole thing really was. There must be another solution to the planet's  problem. \"Listen\u2014\" he began, but just then excited noises filtered  down from overhead. It was too late.\n\n\n \"Earth ship in view!\" a squeaky voice called through the intercom.  \"Everybody topside and don't forget your shoes.\"\n\n\n Except the beggar. Beggars went barefoot. Beggars suffered. Bbulas had  made him beggar purposely, and the lots were a lot of slibwash.\n\n\n \"Hurry up, Skkiru.\" Bbulas slid the ornate headdress over his antennae, which, already  gilded and jeweled, at once seemed to become a part of it. He looked  pretty damn silly, Skkiru thought, at the same time conscious of his  own appearance\u2014which was, although picturesque enough to delight  romantic Terrestrial hearts, sufficiently wretched to charm the most  hardened sadist.\n\n\n \"Hurry up, Skkiru,\" Bbulas said. \"They mustn't suspect the existence of  the city underground or we're finished before we've started.\"\n\n\n \"For my part, I wish we'd never started,\" Skkiru grumbled. \"What was  wrong with our old culture, anyway?\"\n\n\n That was intended as a rhetorical question, but Bbulas answered it  anyway. He always answered questions; it had never seemed to penetrate  his mind that school-days were long since over.\n\n\n \"I've told you a thousand times that our old culture was too much like  the Terrans' own to be of interest to them,\" he said, with affected  weariness. \"After all, most civilized societies are basically similar;  it is only primitive societies that differ sharply, one from the  other\u2014and we have to be different to attract Earthmen. They're pretty  choosy. You've got to give them what they want, and that's what they  want. Now take up your post on the edge of the field, try to look  hungry, and remember this isn't for you or for me, but for Snaddra.\"\n\n\n \"For Snaddra,\" Larhgan said, placing her hand over her anterior heart  in a gesture which, though devout on Earth\u2014or so the fictapes seemed  to indicate\u2014was obscene on Snaddra, owing to the fact that certain  essential organs were located in different areas in the Snaddrath than  in the corresponding Terrestrial life-form. Already the Terrestrial  influence was corrupting her, Skkiru thought mournfully. She had been  such a nice girl, too.\n\n\n \"We may never meet on equal terms again, Skkiru,\" she told him, with a  long, soulful glance that made his hearts sink down to his quivering  toes, \"but I promise you there will never be anyone else for me\u2014and  I hope that knowledge will inspire you to complete cooperation with  Bbulas.\"\n\n\n \"If that doesn't,\" Bbulas said, \"I have other methods of inspiration.\"\n\n\n \"All right,\" Skkiru answered sulkily. \"I'll go to the edge of the  field, and I'll speak broken Inter-galactic, and I'll forsake my normal  habits and customs, and I'll even beg . But I don't have to like doing  it, and I don't intend to like doing it.\"\n\n\n All three of Larhgan's eyes fuzzed with emotion. \"I'm proud of you,  Skkiru,\" she said brokenly.\n\n\n Bbulas sniffed. The three of them floated up to ground level in a  triple silence. \"Alms, for the love of Ipsnadd,\" Skkiru chanted, as the two Terrans  descended from the ship and plowed their way through the mud to meet a  procession of young Snaddrath dressed in elaborate ceremonial costumes,  and singing a popular ballad\u2014to which less ribald, as well as less  inspiring, words than the originals had been fitted by Bbulas, just  in case, by some extremely remote chance, the Terrans had acquired a  smattering of Snadd somewhere. Since neither party was accustomed to  navigating mud, their progress was almost imperceptible.\n\n\n \"Alms, for the love of Ipsnadd,\" chanted Skkiru the beggar.  His teeth chattered as he spoke, for the rags he wore had been  custom-weatherbeaten for him by the planet's best tailor\u2014now a pariah,  of course, because Snadd tailors were, naturally, metal-workers\u2014and  the wind and the rain were joyously making their way through the  demolished wires. Never before had Skkiru been on the surface of the  planet, except to pass over, and he had actually touched it only when  taking off and landing. The Snaddrath had no means of land transport,  having previously found it unnecessary\u2014but now both air-cars and  self-levitation were on the prohibited list as being insufficiently  primitive.\n\n\n The outside was no place for a civilized human being, particularly  in the wet season or\u2014more properly speaking on Snaddra\u2014the wetter  season. Skkiru's feet were soaked with mud; not that the light sandals  worn by the members of the procession appeared to be doing them much  good, either. It gave him a kind of melancholy pleasure to see that the  privileged ones were likewise trying to repress shivers. Though their  costumes were rich, they were also scanty, particularly in the case  of the females, for Earthmen had been reported by tape and tale to be  humanoid.\n\n\n As the mud clutched his toes, Skkiru remembered an idea he had once  gotten from an old sporting fictape of Terrestrial origin and had  always planned to experiment with, but had never gotten around to\u2014the  weather had always been so weathery, there were so many other more  comfortable sports, Larhgan had wanted him to spend more of his leisure  hours with her, and so on. However, he still had the equipment, which  he'd salvaged from a wrecked air-car, in his apartment\u2014and it was the  matter of a moment to run down, while Bbulas was looking the other way,  and get it.\n\n\n Bbulas couldn't really object, Skkiru stilled the nagging quiver in  his toe, because what could be more primitive than any form of land  transport? And even though it took time to get the things, they worked  so well that, in spite of the procession's head start, he was at the  Earth ship long before the official greeters had reached it. The newcomers were indeed humanoid, he saw. Only the peculiarly  pasty color of their skins and their embarrassing lack of antennae  distinguished them visibly from the Snaddrath. They were dressed much  as the Snaddrath had been before they had adopted primitive garb.\n\n\n In fact, the Terrestrials were quite decent-looking life-forms,  entirely different from the foppish monsters Skkiru had somehow  expected to represent the cultural ruling race. Of course, he had  frequently seen pictures of them, but everyone knew how easily those  could be retouched. Why, it was the Terrestrials themselves, he had  always understood, who had invented the art of retouching\u2014thus proving  beyond a doubt that they had something to hide.\n\n\n \"Look, Raoul,\" the older of the two Earthmen said in Terran\u2014which  the Snaddrath were not, according to the master plan, supposed to  understand, but which most of them did, for it was the fashionable  third language on most of the outer planets. \"A beggar. Haven't seen  one since some other chaps and I were doing a spot of field work on  that little planet in the Arcturus system\u2014what was its name? Glotch,  that's it. Very short study, it turned out to be. Couldn't get more  than a pamphlet out of it, as we were unable to stay long enough to  amass enough material for a really definitive work. The natives tried  to eat us, so we had to leave in somewhat of a hurry.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, they were cannibals?\" the other Earthman asked, so respectfully  that it was easy to deduce he was the subordinate of the two. \"How  horrible!\"\n\n\n \"No, not at all,\" the other assured him. \"They weren't human\u2014another  species entirely\u2014so you could hardly call it cannibalism. In fact, it  was quite all right from the ethical standpoint, but abstract moral  considerations seemed less important to us than self-preservation  just then. Decided that, in this case, it would be best to let the  missionaries get first crack at them. Soften them up, you know.\"\n\n\n \"And the missionaries\u2014did they soften them up, Cyril?\"\n\n\n \"They softened up the missionaries, I believe.\" Cyril laughed. \"Ah,  well, it's all in the day's work.\"\n\n\n \"I hope these creatures are not man-eaters,\" Raoul commented, with  a polite smile at Cyril and an apprehensive glance at the oncoming  procession\u2014 creatures indeed ! Skkiru thought, with a mental sniff.  \"We have come such a long and expensive way to study them that it would  be indeed a pity if we also were forced to depart in haste. Especially  since this is my first field trip and I would like to make good at it.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, you will, my boy, you will.\" Cyril clapped the younger man on the  shoulder. \"I have every confidence in your ability.\"\n\n\n Either he was stupid, Skkiru thought, or he was lying, in spite of  Bbulas' asseverations that untruth was unknown to Terrestrials\u2014which  had always seemed highly improbable, anyway. How could any intelligent  life-form possibly stick to the truth all the time? It wasn't human; it  wasn't even humanoid; it wasn't even polite.\n\n\n \"The natives certainly appear to be human enough,\" Raoul added, with  an appreciative glance at the females, who had been selected for the  processional honor with a view to reported Terrestrial tastes. \"Some  slight differences, of course\u2014but, if two eyes are beautiful, three  eyes can be fifty per cent lovelier, and chartreuse has always been my  favorite color.\" If they stand out here in the cold much longer, they are going to turn  bright yellow. His own skin, Skkiru knew, had faded from its normal  healthy emerald to a sickly celadon. Cyril frowned and his companion's smile vanished, as if the contortion  of his superior's face had activated a circuit somewhere. Maybe the  little one's a robot! However, it couldn't be\u2014a robot would be better  constructed and less interested in females than Raoul.\n\n\n \"Remember,\" Cyril said sternly, \"we must not establish undue rapport  with the native females. It tends to detract from true objectivity.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, Cyril,\" Raoul said meekly.\n\n\n Cyril assumed a more cheerful aspect \"I should like to give this chap  something for old times' sake. What do you suppose is the medium of  exchange here?\" Money , Skkiru said to himself, but he didn't dare contribute this  piece of information, helpful though it would be.\n\n\n \"How should I know?\" Raoul shrugged.\n\n\n \"Empathize. Get in there, old chap, and start batting.\"\n\n\n \"Why not give him a bar of chocolate, then?\" Raoul suggested grumpily.  \"The language of the stomach, like the language of love, is said to be  a universal one.\"\n\n\n \"Splendid idea! I always knew you had it in you, Raoul!\"\n\n\n Skkiru accepted the candy with suitable\u2014and entirely genuine\u2014murmurs  of gratitude. Chocolate was found only in the most expensive of the  planet's delicacy shops\u2014and now neither delicacy shops nor chocolate  were to be found, so, if Bbulas thought he was going to save the gift  to contribute it later to the Treasury, the \"high priest\" was off his  rocker.\n\n\n To make sure there would be no subsequent dispute about possession,  Skkiru ate the candy then and there. Chocolate increased the body's  resistance to weather, and never before had he had to endure so much  weather all at once.\n\n\n On Earth, he had heard, where people lived exposed to weather, they  often sickened of it and passed on\u2014which helped to solve the problem  of birth control on so vulgarly fecund a planet. Snaddra, alas, needed  no such measures, for its population\u2014like its natural resources\u2014was  dwindling rapidly. Still, Skkiru thought, as he moodily munched on the  chocolate, it would have been better to flicker out on their own than  to descend to a subterfuge like this for nothing more than survival. Being a beggar, Skkiru discovered, did give him certain small,  momentary advantages over those who had been alloted higher ranks.  For one thing, it was quite in character for him to tread curiously  upon the strangers' heels all the way to the temple\u2014a ramshackle  affair, but then it had been run up in only three days\u2014where the  official reception was to be held. The principal difficulty was that,  because of his equipment, he had a little trouble keeping himself from  overshooting the strangers. And though Bbulas might frown menacingly at  him\u2014and not only for his forwardness\u2014that was in character on both  sides, too.\n\n\n Nonetheless, Skkiru could not reconcile himself to his beggarhood, no  matter how much he tried to comfort himself by thinking at least he  wasn't a pariah like the unfortunate metal-workers who had to stand  segregated from the rest by a chain of their own devising\u2014a poetic  thought, that was, but well in keeping with his beggarhood. Beggars  were often poets, he believed, and poets almost always beggars. Since  metal-working was the chief industry of Snaddra, this had provided the  planet automatically with a large lowest caste. Bbulas had taken the  easy way out.\n\n\n Skkiru swallowed the last of the chocolate and regarded the \"high  priest\" with a simple-minded mendicant's grin. However, there were  volcanic passions within him that surged up from his toes when, as the  wind and rain whipped through his scanty coverings, he remembered the  snug underskirts Bbulas was wearing beneath his warm gown. They were  metal, but they were solid. All the garments visible or potentially  visible were of woven metal, because, although there was cloth on the  planet, it was not politic for the Earthmen to discover how heavily the  Snaddrath depended upon imports.\n\n\n As the Earthmen reached the temple, Larhgan now appeared to join Bbulas  at the head of the long flight of stairs that led to it. Although  Skkiru had seen her in her priestly apparel before, it had not made  the emotional impression upon him then that it did now, when, standing  there, clad in beauty, dignity and warm clothes, she bade the newcomers  welcome in several thousand words not too well chosen for her by  Bbulas\u2014who fancied himself a speech-writer as well as a speech-maker,  for there was no end to the man's conceit.\n\n\n The difference between her magnificent garments and his own miserable  rags had their full impact upon Skkiru at this moment. He saw the gulf  that had been dug between them and, for the first time in his short  life, he felt the tormenting pangs of caste distinction. She looked so  lovely and so remote.\n\n\n \"... and so you are most welcome to Snaddra, men of Earth,\" she was  saying in her melodious voice. \"Our resources may be small but our  hearts are large, and what little we have, we offer with humility and  with love. We hope that you will enjoy as long and as happy a stay here  as you did on Nemeth....\"\n\n\n Cyril looked at Raoul, who, however, seemed too absorbed in  contemplating Larhgan's apparently universal charms to pay much  attention to the expression on his companion's face.\n\n\n \"... and that you will carry our affection back to all the peoples of  the Galaxy.\" She had finished. And now Cyril cleared his throat. \"Dear friends, we  were honored by your gracious invitation to visit this fair planet, and  we are honored now by the cordial reception you have given to us.\"\n\n\n The crowd yoomped politely. After a slight start, Cyril went on,  apparently deciding that applause was all that had been intended.\n\n\n \"We feel quite sure that we are going to derive both pleasure and  profit from our stay here, and we promise to make our intensive  analysis of your culture as painless as possible. We wish only to study  your society, not to tamper with it in any way.\" Ha, ha , Skkiru said to himself. Ha, ha, ha! \"But why is it,\" Raoul whispered in Terran as he glanced around out of  the corners of his eyes, \"that only the beggar wears mudshoes?\"\n\n\n \"Shhh,\" Cyril hissed back. \"We'll find out later, when we've  established rapport. Don't be so impatient!\"\n\n\n Bbulas gave a sickly smile. Skkiru could almost find it in his hearts  to feel sorry for the man.\n\n\n \"We have prepared our best hut for you, noble sirs,\" Bbulas said with  great self-control, \"and, by happy chance, this very evening a small  but unusually interesting ceremony will be held outside the temple. We  hope you will be able to attend. It is to be a rain dance.\"\n\n\n \"Rain dance!\" Raoul pulled his macintosh together more tightly at the  throat. \"But why do you want rain? My faith, not only does it rain now,  but the planet seems to be a veritable sea of mud. Not, of course,\" he  added hurriedly as Cyril's reproachful eye caught his, \"that it is not  attractive mud. Finest mud I have ever seen. Such texture, such color,  such aroma!\"\n\n\n Cyril nodded three times and gave an appreciative sniff.\n\n\n \"But,\" Raoul went on, \"one can have too much of even such a good thing  as mud....\"\n\n\n The smile did not leave Bbulas' smooth face. \"Yes, of course, honorable  Terrestrials. That is why we are holding this ceremony. It is not a  dance to bring on rain. It is a dance to stop rain.\"\n\n\n He was pretty quick on the uptake, Skkiru had to concede. However,  that was not enough. The man had no genuine organizational ability.  In the time he'd had in which to plan and carry out a scheme for  the improvement of Snaddra, surely he could have done better than  this high-school theocracy. For one thing, he could have apportioned  the various roles so that each person would be making a definite  contribution to the society, instead of creating some positions plums,  like the priesthood, and others prunes, like the beggarship.\n\n\n What kind of life was that for an active, ambitious young man, standing  around begging? And, moreover, from whom was Skkiru going to beg?  Only the Earthmen, for the Snaddrath, no matter how much they threw  themselves into the spirit of their roles, could not be so carried  away that they would give handouts to a young man whom they had been  accustomed to see basking in the bosom of luxury. Unfortunately, the fees that he'd received in the past had not enabled  him both to live well and to save, and now that his fortunes had been  so drastically reduced, he seemed in a fair way of starving to death.  It gave him a gentle, moody pleasure to envisage his own funeral,  although, at the same time, he realized that Bbulas would probably have  to arrange some sort of pension for him; he could not expect Skkiru's  patriotism to extend to abnormal limits. A man might be willing to die  for his planet in many ways\u2014but wantonly starving to death as the  result of a primitive affectation was hardly one of them.\n\n\n All the same, Skkiru reflected as he watched the visitors being led off  to the native hut prepared for them, how ignominious it would be for  one of the brightest young architects on the planet to have to subsist  miserably on the dole just because the world had gone aboveground. The  capital had risen to the surface and the other cities would soon follow  suit. Meanwhile, a careful system of tabus had been designed to keep  the Earthmen from discovering the existence of those other cities.\n\n\n He could, of course, emigrate to another part of the planet, to one of  them, and stave off his doom for a while\u2014but that would not be playing  the game. Besides, in such a case, he wouldn't be able to see Larhgan.\n\n\n As if all this weren't bad enough, he had been done an injury which  struck directly at his professional pride. He hadn't even been allowed  to help in planning the huts. Bbulas and some workmen had done all that  themselves with the aid of some antique blueprints that had been put  out centuries before by a Terrestrial magazine and had been acquired  from a rare tape-and-book dealer on Gambrell, for, Skkiru thought, far  too high a price. He could have designed them himself just as badly and  much more cheaply.\n\n\n It wasn't that Skkiru didn't understand well enough that Snaddra had  been forced into making such a drastic change in its way of life.  What resources it once possessed had been depleted and\u2014aside from  minerals\u2014they had never been very extensive to begin with. All  life-forms on the planet were on the point of extinction, save fish and  rice\u2014the only vegetable that would grow on Snaddra, and originally a  Terran import at that. So food and fiber had to be brought from the  other planets, at fabulous expense, for Snaddra was not on any of  the direct trade routes and was too unattractive to lure the tourist  business.\n\n\n Something definitely had to be done, if it were not to decay  altogether. And that was where the Planetary Dilettante came in. The traditional office of Planetary Dilettante was a civil-service  job, awarded by competitive examination whenever it fell vacant to  the person who scored highest in intelligence, character and general  gloonatz. However, the tests were inadequate when it came to measuring  sense of proportion, adaptiveness and charm\u2014and there, Skkiru felt,  was where the essential flaw lay. After all, no really effective test  would have let a person like Bbulas come out on top.\n\n\n The winner was sent to Gambrell, the nearest planet with a Terran  League University, to be given a thorough Terran-type education. No  individual on Snaddra could afford such schooling, no matter how  great his personal fortune, because the transportation costs were so  immense that only a government could afford them. That was the reason  why only one person in each generation could be chosen to go abroad at  the planet's expense and acquire enough finish to cover the rest of the  population.\n\n\n The Dilettante's official function had always been, in theory, to serve  the planet when an emergency came\u2014and this, old Luccar, the former  President, had decided, when he and the Parliament had awakened to the  fact that Snaddra was falling into ruin, was an emergency. So he had,  after considerable soul-searching, called upon Bbulas to plan a method  of saving Snaddra\u2014and Bbulas, happy to be in the limelight at last,  had come up with this program.\n\n\n It was not one Skkiru himself would have chosen. It was not one, he  felt, that any reasonable person would have chosen. Nevertheless, the  Bbulas Plan had been adopted by a majority vote of the Snaddrath,  largely because no one had come up with a feasible alternative and,  as a patriotic citizen, Skkiru would abide by it. He would accept the  status of beggar; it was his duty to do so. Moreover, as in the case of  the planet, there was no choice.\n\n\n But all was not necessarily lost, he told himself. Had he not, in his  anthropological viewings\u2014though Bbulas might have been the only one  privileged to go on ethnological field trips to other planets, he was  not the only one who could use a library\u2014seen accounts of societies  where beggarhood could be a rewarding and even responsible station in  life? There was no reason why, within the framework of the primitive  society Bbulas had created to allure Terran anthropologists, Skkiru  should not make something of himself and show that a beggar was worthy  of the high priestess's hand\u2014which would be entirely in the Terran  primitive tradition of romance.\n\n\n \"Skkiru!\" Bbulas was screaming, as he spun, now that the Terrans were  out of ear- and eye-shot \"Skkiru, you idiot, listen to me! What are  those ridiculous things you are wearing on your silly feet?\"\n\n\n Skkiru protruded all of his eyes in innocent surprise. \"Just some  old pontoons I took from a wrecked air-car once. I have a habit of  collecting junk and I thought\u2014\"\n\n\n Bbulas twirled madly in the air. \"You are not supposed to think. Leave  all the thinking to me!\"\n\n\n \"Yes, Bbulas,\" Skkiru said meekly. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy did Skkiru think the dilettante had fixed the lots?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"the dilettante was egotistical\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"the dilettante was jealous of his girlfriend\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"the dilettante was jealous of his girlfriend\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"the dilettante was jealous of his girlfriend\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

SMITH\n\n\n Illustrated by DILLON\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Galaxy Science Fiction March 1957.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Snaddra had but one choice in its fight   to afford to live belowground\u2014underhandedly   pretend theirs was an aboveboard society! \"Go Away from me, Skkiru,\" Larhgan said, pushing his hand off her arm.  \"A beggar does not associate with the high priestess of Snaddra.\"\n\n\n \"But the Earthmen aren't due for another fifteen minutes,\" Skkiru  protested.\n\n\n \"Of what importance are fifteen minutes compared to eternity!\" she  exclaimed. Her lovely eyes fuzzed softly with emotion. \"You don't seem  to realize, Skkiru, that this isn't just a matter of minutes or hours.  It's forever.\" \"Forever!\" He looked at her incredulously. \"You mean we're going to  keep this up as a permanent thing? You're joking!\"\n\n\n Bbulas groaned, but Skkiru didn't care about that. The sad, sweet way  Larhgan shook her beautiful head disturbed him much more, and when  she said, \"No, Skkiru, I am not joking,\" a tiny pang of doubt and  apprehension began to quiver in his second smallest left toe.\n\n\n \"This is, in effect, good-by,\" she continued. \"We shall see each other  again, of course, but only from a distance. On feast days, perhaps you  may be permitted to kiss the hem of my robe ... but that will be all.\"\n\n\n Skkiru turned to the third person present in the council chamber.  \"Bbulas, this is your fault! It was all your idea!\"\n\n\n There was regret on the Dilettante's thin face\u2014an obviously insincere  regret, the younger man knew, since he was well aware how Bbulas had  always felt about the girl.\n\n\n \"I am sorry, Skkiru,\" Bbulas intoned. \"I had fancied you understood.  This is not a game we are playing, but a new way of life we are  adopting. A necessary way of life, if we of Snaddra are to keep on  living at all.\"\n\n\n \"It's not that I don't love you, Skkiru,\" Larhgan put in gently, \"but  the welfare of our planet comes first.\" She had been seeing too many of the Terrestrial fictapes from the  library, Skkiru thought resentfully. There was too damn much Terran  influence on this planet. And this new project was the last straw.\n\n\n No longer able to control his rage and grief, he turned a triple  somersault in the air with rage. \"Then why was I made a beggar and she  the high priestess? You arranged that purposely, Bbulas. You\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Now, Skkiru,\" Bbulas said wearily, for they had been through all this  before, \"you know that all the ranks and positions were distributed  by impartial lot, except for mine, and, of course, such jobs as could  carry over from the civilized into the primitive.\"\n\n\n Bbulas breathed on the spectacles he was wearing, as contact lenses  were not considered backward enough for the kind of planet Snaddra  was now supposed to be, and attempted to wipe them dry on his robe.  However, the thick, jewel-studded embroidery got in his way and so he  was forced to lift the robe and wipe all three of the lenses on the  smooth, soft, spun metal of his top underskirt.\n\n\n \"After all,\" he went on speaking as he wiped, \"I have to be high  priest, since I organized this culture and am the only one here  qualified to administer it. And, as the president himself concurred in  these arrangements, I hardly think you\u2014a mere private citizen\u2014have  the right to question them.\"\n\n\n \"Just because you went to school in another solar system,\" Skkiru said,  whirling with anger, \"you think you're so smart!\"\n\n\n \"I won't deny that I do have educational and cultural advantages  which were, unfortunately, not available to the general populace of  this planet. However, even under the old system, I was always glad to  utilize my superior attainments as Official Dilettante for the good of  all and now\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sure, glad to have a chance to rig this whole setup so you could break  up things between Larhgan and me. You've had your eye on her for some  time.\"\n\n\n Skkiru coiled his antennae at Bbulas, hoping the insult would provoke  him into an unbecoming whirl, but the Dilettante remained calm. One of  the chief outward signs of Terran-type training was self-control and  Bbulas had been thoroughly terranized. I hate Terrestrials , Skkiru said to himself. I hate Terra. The  quiver of anxiety had risen up his leg and was coiling and uncoiling  in his stomach. He hoped it wouldn't reach his antennae\u2014if he were  to break down and psonk in front of Larhgan, it would be the final  humiliation.\n\n\n \"Skkiru!\" the girl exclaimed, rotating gently, for she, like her  fiance\u2014her erstwhile fiance, that was, for the new regime had caused  all such ties to be severed\u2014and every other literate person on the  planet, had received her education at the local university. Although  sound, the school was admittedly provincial in outlook and very poor  in the emotional department. \"One would almost think that the lots had  some sort of divine intelligence behind them, because you certainly are  behaving in a beggarly manner!\"\n\n\n \"And I have already explained to you, Skkiru,\" Bbulas said, with a  patience much more infuriating than the girl's anger, \"that I had no  idea of who was to become my high priestess. The lots chose Larhgan. It  is, as the Earthmen say, kismet.\" He adjusted the fall of his glittering robe before the great polished  four-dimensional reflector that formed one wall of the chamber. Kismet , Skkiru muttered to himself, and a little sleight of hand. But he didn't dare offer this conclusion aloud; the libel laws of  Snaddra were very severe. So he had to fall back on a weak, \"And I  suppose it is kismet that makes us all have to go live out on the  ground during the day, like\u2014like savages.\"\n\n\n \"It is necessary,\" Bbulas replied without turning.\n\n\n \"Pooh,\" Skkiru said. \"Pooh, pooh , POOH!\"\n\n\n Larhgan's dainty earflaps closed. \"Skkiru! Such language!\"\n\n\n \"As you said,\" Bbulas murmured, contemptuously coiling one antenna at  Skkiru, \"the lots chose well and if you touch me, Skkiru, we shall have  another drawing for beggar and you will be made a metal-worker.\"\n\n\n \"But I can't work metal!\"\n\n\n \"Then that will make it much worse for you than for the other  outcasts,\" Bbulas said smugly, \"because you will be a pariah without a  trade.\"\n\n\n \"Speaking of pariahs, that reminds me, Skkiru, before I forget, I'd  better give you back your grimpatch\u2014\" Larhgan handed the glittering  bauble to him\u2014\"and you give me mine. Since we can't be betrothed any  longer, you might want to give yours to some nice beggar girl.\"\n\n\n \"I don't want to give my grimpatch to some nice beggar girl!\" Skkiru  yelled, twirling madly in the air.\n\n\n \"As for me,\" she sighed, standing soulfully on her head, \"I do not  think I shall ever marry. I shall make the religious life my career.  Are there going to be any saints in your mythos, Bbulas?\"\n\n\n \"Even if there will be,\" Bbulas said, \"you certainly won't qualify if  you keep putting yourself into a position which not only represents a  trait wholly out of keeping with the new culture, but is most unseemly  with the high priestess's robes.\"\n\n\n Larhgan ignored his unfeeling observations. \"I shall set myself apart  from mundane affairs,\" she vowed, \"and I shall pretend to be happy,  even though my heart will be breaking.\"\n\n\n It was only at that moment that Skkiru realized just how outrageous the  whole thing really was. There must be another solution to the planet's  problem. \"Listen\u2014\" he began, but just then excited noises filtered  down from overhead. It was too late.\n\n\n \"Earth ship in view!\" a squeaky voice called through the intercom.  \"Everybody topside and don't forget your shoes.\"\n\n\n Except the beggar. Beggars went barefoot. Beggars suffered. Bbulas had  made him beggar purposely, and the lots were a lot of slibwash.\n\n\n \"Hurry up, Skkiru.\" Bbulas slid the ornate headdress over his antennae, which, already  gilded and jeweled, at once seemed to become a part of it. He looked  pretty damn silly, Skkiru thought, at the same time conscious of his  own appearance\u2014which was, although picturesque enough to delight  romantic Terrestrial hearts, sufficiently wretched to charm the most  hardened sadist.\n\n\n \"Hurry up, Skkiru,\" Bbulas said. \"They mustn't suspect the existence of  the city underground or we're finished before we've started.\"\n\n\n \"For my part, I wish we'd never started,\" Skkiru grumbled. \"What was  wrong with our old culture, anyway?\"\n\n\n That was intended as a rhetorical question, but Bbulas answered it  anyway. He always answered questions; it had never seemed to penetrate  his mind that school-days were long since over.\n\n\n \"I've told you a thousand times that our old culture was too much like  the Terrans' own to be of interest to them,\" he said, with affected  weariness. \"After all, most civilized societies are basically similar;  it is only primitive societies that differ sharply, one from the  other\u2014and we have to be different to attract Earthmen. They're pretty  choosy. You've got to give them what they want, and that's what they  want. Now take up your post on the edge of the field, try to look  hungry, and remember this isn't for you or for me, but for Snaddra.\"\n\n\n \"For Snaddra,\" Larhgan said, placing her hand over her anterior heart  in a gesture which, though devout on Earth\u2014or so the fictapes seemed  to indicate\u2014was obscene on Snaddra, owing to the fact that certain  essential organs were located in different areas in the Snaddrath than  in the corresponding Terrestrial life-form. Already the Terrestrial  influence was corrupting her, Skkiru thought mournfully. She had been  such a nice girl, too.\n\n\n \"We may never meet on equal terms again, Skkiru,\" she told him, with a  long, soulful glance that made his hearts sink down to his quivering  toes, \"but I promise you there will never be anyone else for me\u2014and  I hope that knowledge will inspire you to complete cooperation with  Bbulas.\"\n\n\n \"If that doesn't,\" Bbulas said, \"I have other methods of inspiration.\"\n\n\n \"All right,\" Skkiru answered sulkily. \"I'll go to the edge of the  field, and I'll speak broken Inter-galactic, and I'll forsake my normal  habits and customs, and I'll even beg . But I don't have to like doing  it, and I don't intend to like doing it.\"\n\n\n All three of Larhgan's eyes fuzzed with emotion. \"I'm proud of you,  Skkiru,\" she said brokenly.\n\n\n Bbulas sniffed. The three of them floated up to ground level in a  triple silence. \"Alms, for the love of Ipsnadd,\" Skkiru chanted, as the two Terrans  descended from the ship and plowed their way through the mud to meet a  procession of young Snaddrath dressed in elaborate ceremonial costumes,  and singing a popular ballad\u2014to which less ribald, as well as less  inspiring, words than the originals had been fitted by Bbulas, just  in case, by some extremely remote chance, the Terrans had acquired a  smattering of Snadd somewhere. Since neither party was accustomed to  navigating mud, their progress was almost imperceptible.\n\n\n \"Alms, for the love of Ipsnadd,\" chanted Skkiru the beggar.  His teeth chattered as he spoke, for the rags he wore had been  custom-weatherbeaten for him by the planet's best tailor\u2014now a pariah,  of course, because Snadd tailors were, naturally, metal-workers\u2014and  the wind and the rain were joyously making their way through the  demolished wires. Never before had Skkiru been on the surface of the  planet, except to pass over, and he had actually touched it only when  taking off and landing. The Snaddrath had no means of land transport,  having previously found it unnecessary\u2014but now both air-cars and  self-levitation were on the prohibited list as being insufficiently  primitive.\n\n\n The outside was no place for a civilized human being, particularly  in the wet season or\u2014more properly speaking on Snaddra\u2014the wetter  season. Skkiru's feet were soaked with mud; not that the light sandals  worn by the members of the procession appeared to be doing them much  good, either. It gave him a kind of melancholy pleasure to see that the  privileged ones were likewise trying to repress shivers. Though their  costumes were rich, they were also scanty, particularly in the case  of the females, for Earthmen had been reported by tape and tale to be  humanoid.\n\n\n As the mud clutched his toes, Skkiru remembered an idea he had once  gotten from an old sporting fictape of Terrestrial origin and had  always planned to experiment with, but had never gotten around to\u2014the  weather had always been so weathery, there were so many other more  comfortable sports, Larhgan had wanted him to spend more of his leisure  hours with her, and so on. However, he still had the equipment, which  he'd salvaged from a wrecked air-car, in his apartment\u2014and it was the  matter of a moment to run down, while Bbulas was looking the other way,  and get it.\n\n\n Bbulas couldn't really object, Skkiru stilled the nagging quiver in  his toe, because what could be more primitive than any form of land  transport? And even though it took time to get the things, they worked  so well that, in spite of the procession's head start, he was at the  Earth ship long before the official greeters had reached it. The newcomers were indeed humanoid, he saw. Only the peculiarly  pasty color of their skins and their embarrassing lack of antennae  distinguished them visibly from the Snaddrath. They were dressed much  as the Snaddrath had been before they had adopted primitive garb.\n\n\n In fact, the Terrestrials were quite decent-looking life-forms,  entirely different from the foppish monsters Skkiru had somehow  expected to represent the cultural ruling race. Of course, he had  frequently seen pictures of them, but everyone knew how easily those  could be retouched. Why, it was the Terrestrials themselves, he had  always understood, who had invented the art of retouching\u2014thus proving  beyond a doubt that they had something to hide.\n\n\n \"Look, Raoul,\" the older of the two Earthmen said in Terran\u2014which  the Snaddrath were not, according to the master plan, supposed to  understand, but which most of them did, for it was the fashionable  third language on most of the outer planets. \"A beggar. Haven't seen  one since some other chaps and I were doing a spot of field work on  that little planet in the Arcturus system\u2014what was its name? Glotch,  that's it. Very short study, it turned out to be. Couldn't get more  than a pamphlet out of it, as we were unable to stay long enough to  amass enough material for a really definitive work. The natives tried  to eat us, so we had to leave in somewhat of a hurry.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, they were cannibals?\" the other Earthman asked, so respectfully  that it was easy to deduce he was the subordinate of the two. \"How  horrible!\"\n\n\n \"No, not at all,\" the other assured him. \"They weren't human\u2014another  species entirely\u2014so you could hardly call it cannibalism. In fact, it  was quite all right from the ethical standpoint, but abstract moral  considerations seemed less important to us than self-preservation  just then. Decided that, in this case, it would be best to let the  missionaries get first crack at them. Soften them up, you know.\"\n\n\n \"And the missionaries\u2014did they soften them up, Cyril?\"\n\n\n \"They softened up the missionaries, I believe.\" Cyril laughed. \"Ah,  well, it's all in the day's work.\"\n\n\n \"I hope these creatures are not man-eaters,\" Raoul commented, with  a polite smile at Cyril and an apprehensive glance at the oncoming  procession\u2014 creatures indeed ! Skkiru thought, with a mental sniff.  \"We have come such a long and expensive way to study them that it would  be indeed a pity if we also were forced to depart in haste. Especially  since this is my first field trip and I would like to make good at it.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, you will, my boy, you will.\" Cyril clapped the younger man on the  shoulder. \"I have every confidence in your ability.\"\n\n\n Either he was stupid, Skkiru thought, or he was lying, in spite of  Bbulas' asseverations that untruth was unknown to Terrestrials\u2014which  had always seemed highly improbable, anyway. How could any intelligent  life-form possibly stick to the truth all the time? It wasn't human; it  wasn't even humanoid; it wasn't even polite.\n\n\n \"The natives certainly appear to be human enough,\" Raoul added, with  an appreciative glance at the females, who had been selected for the  processional honor with a view to reported Terrestrial tastes. \"Some  slight differences, of course\u2014but, if two eyes are beautiful, three  eyes can be fifty per cent lovelier, and chartreuse has always been my  favorite color.\" If they stand out here in the cold much longer, they are going to turn  bright yellow. His own skin, Skkiru knew, had faded from its normal  healthy emerald to a sickly celadon. Cyril frowned and his companion's smile vanished, as if the contortion  of his superior's face had activated a circuit somewhere. Maybe the  little one's a robot! However, it couldn't be\u2014a robot would be better  constructed and less interested in females than Raoul.\n\n\n \"Remember,\" Cyril said sternly, \"we must not establish undue rapport  with the native females. It tends to detract from true objectivity.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, Cyril,\" Raoul said meekly.\n\n\n Cyril assumed a more cheerful aspect \"I should like to give this chap  something for old times' sake. What do you suppose is the medium of  exchange here?\" Money , Skkiru said to himself, but he didn't dare contribute this  piece of information, helpful though it would be.\n\n\n \"How should I know?\" Raoul shrugged.\n\n\n \"Empathize. Get in there, old chap, and start batting.\"\n\n\n \"Why not give him a bar of chocolate, then?\" Raoul suggested grumpily.  \"The language of the stomach, like the language of love, is said to be  a universal one.\"\n\n\n \"Splendid idea! I always knew you had it in you, Raoul!\"\n\n\n Skkiru accepted the candy with suitable\u2014and entirely genuine\u2014murmurs  of gratitude. Chocolate was found only in the most expensive of the  planet's delicacy shops\u2014and now neither delicacy shops nor chocolate  were to be found, so, if Bbulas thought he was going to save the gift  to contribute it later to the Treasury, the \"high priest\" was off his  rocker.\n\n\n To make sure there would be no subsequent dispute about possession,  Skkiru ate the candy then and there. Chocolate increased the body's  resistance to weather, and never before had he had to endure so much  weather all at once.\n\n\n On Earth, he had heard, where people lived exposed to weather, they  often sickened of it and passed on\u2014which helped to solve the problem  of birth control on so vulgarly fecund a planet. Snaddra, alas, needed  no such measures, for its population\u2014like its natural resources\u2014was  dwindling rapidly. Still, Skkiru thought, as he moodily munched on the  chocolate, it would have been better to flicker out on their own than  to descend to a subterfuge like this for nothing more than survival. Being a beggar, Skkiru discovered, did give him certain small,  momentary advantages over those who had been alloted higher ranks.  For one thing, it was quite in character for him to tread curiously  upon the strangers' heels all the way to the temple\u2014a ramshackle  affair, but then it had been run up in only three days\u2014where the  official reception was to be held. The principal difficulty was that,  because of his equipment, he had a little trouble keeping himself from  overshooting the strangers. And though Bbulas might frown menacingly at  him\u2014and not only for his forwardness\u2014that was in character on both  sides, too.\n\n\n Nonetheless, Skkiru could not reconcile himself to his beggarhood, no  matter how much he tried to comfort himself by thinking at least he  wasn't a pariah like the unfortunate metal-workers who had to stand  segregated from the rest by a chain of their own devising\u2014a poetic  thought, that was, but well in keeping with his beggarhood. Beggars  were often poets, he believed, and poets almost always beggars. Since  metal-working was the chief industry of Snaddra, this had provided the  planet automatically with a large lowest caste. Bbulas had taken the  easy way out.\n\n\n Skkiru swallowed the last of the chocolate and regarded the \"high  priest\" with a simple-minded mendicant's grin. However, there were  volcanic passions within him that surged up from his toes when, as the  wind and rain whipped through his scanty coverings, he remembered the  snug underskirts Bbulas was wearing beneath his warm gown. They were  metal, but they were solid. All the garments visible or potentially  visible were of woven metal, because, although there was cloth on the  planet, it was not politic for the Earthmen to discover how heavily the  Snaddrath depended upon imports.\n\n\n As the Earthmen reached the temple, Larhgan now appeared to join Bbulas  at the head of the long flight of stairs that led to it. Although  Skkiru had seen her in her priestly apparel before, it had not made  the emotional impression upon him then that it did now, when, standing  there, clad in beauty, dignity and warm clothes, she bade the newcomers  welcome in several thousand words not too well chosen for her by  Bbulas\u2014who fancied himself a speech-writer as well as a speech-maker,  for there was no end to the man's conceit.\n\n\n The difference between her magnificent garments and his own miserable  rags had their full impact upon Skkiru at this moment. He saw the gulf  that had been dug between them and, for the first time in his short  life, he felt the tormenting pangs of caste distinction. She looked so  lovely and so remote.\n\n\n \"... and so you are most welcome to Snaddra, men of Earth,\" she was  saying in her melodious voice. \"Our resources may be small but our  hearts are large, and what little we have, we offer with humility and  with love. We hope that you will enjoy as long and as happy a stay here  as you did on Nemeth....\"\n\n\n Cyril looked at Raoul, who, however, seemed too absorbed in  contemplating Larhgan's apparently universal charms to pay much  attention to the expression on his companion's face.\n\n\n \"... and that you will carry our affection back to all the peoples of  the Galaxy.\" She had finished. And now Cyril cleared his throat. \"Dear friends, we  were honored by your gracious invitation to visit this fair planet, and  we are honored now by the cordial reception you have given to us.\"\n\n\n The crowd yoomped politely. After a slight start, Cyril went on,  apparently deciding that applause was all that had been intended.\n\n\n \"We feel quite sure that we are going to derive both pleasure and  profit from our stay here, and we promise to make our intensive  analysis of your culture as painless as possible. We wish only to study  your society, not to tamper with it in any way.\" Ha, ha , Skkiru said to himself. Ha, ha, ha! \"But why is it,\" Raoul whispered in Terran as he glanced around out of  the corners of his eyes, \"that only the beggar wears mudshoes?\"\n\n\n \"Shhh,\" Cyril hissed back. \"We'll find out later, when we've  established rapport. Don't be so impatient!\"\n\n\n Bbulas gave a sickly smile. Skkiru could almost find it in his hearts  to feel sorry for the man.\n\n\n \"We have prepared our best hut for you, noble sirs,\" Bbulas said with  great self-control, \"and, by happy chance, this very evening a small  but unusually interesting ceremony will be held outside the temple. We  hope you will be able to attend. It is to be a rain dance.\"\n\n\n \"Rain dance!\" Raoul pulled his macintosh together more tightly at the  throat. \"But why do you want rain? My faith, not only does it rain now,  but the planet seems to be a veritable sea of mud. Not, of course,\" he  added hurriedly as Cyril's reproachful eye caught his, \"that it is not  attractive mud. Finest mud I have ever seen. Such texture, such color,  such aroma!\"\n\n\n Cyril nodded three times and gave an appreciative sniff.\n\n\n \"But,\" Raoul went on, \"one can have too much of even such a good thing  as mud....\"\n\n\n The smile did not leave Bbulas' smooth face. \"Yes, of course, honorable  Terrestrials. That is why we are holding this ceremony. It is not a  dance to bring on rain. It is a dance to stop rain.\"\n\n\n He was pretty quick on the uptake, Skkiru had to concede. However,  that was not enough. The man had no genuine organizational ability.  In the time he'd had in which to plan and carry out a scheme for  the improvement of Snaddra, surely he could have done better than  this high-school theocracy. For one thing, he could have apportioned  the various roles so that each person would be making a definite  contribution to the society, instead of creating some positions plums,  like the priesthood, and others prunes, like the beggarship.\n\n\n What kind of life was that for an active, ambitious young man, standing  around begging? And, moreover, from whom was Skkiru going to beg?  Only the Earthmen, for the Snaddrath, no matter how much they threw  themselves into the spirit of their roles, could not be so carried  away that they would give handouts to a young man whom they had been  accustomed to see basking in the bosom of luxury. Unfortunately, the fees that he'd received in the past had not enabled  him both to live well and to save, and now that his fortunes had been  so drastically reduced, he seemed in a fair way of starving to death.  It gave him a gentle, moody pleasure to envisage his own funeral,  although, at the same time, he realized that Bbulas would probably have  to arrange some sort of pension for him; he could not expect Skkiru's  patriotism to extend to abnormal limits. A man might be willing to die  for his planet in many ways\u2014but wantonly starving to death as the  result of a primitive affectation was hardly one of them.\n\n\n All the same, Skkiru reflected as he watched the visitors being led off  to the native hut prepared for them, how ignominious it would be for  one of the brightest young architects on the planet to have to subsist  miserably on the dole just because the world had gone aboveground. The  capital had risen to the surface and the other cities would soon follow  suit. Meanwhile, a careful system of tabus had been designed to keep  the Earthmen from discovering the existence of those other cities.\n\n\n He could, of course, emigrate to another part of the planet, to one of  them, and stave off his doom for a while\u2014but that would not be playing  the game. Besides, in such a case, he wouldn't be able to see Larhgan.\n\n\n As if all this weren't bad enough, he had been done an injury which  struck directly at his professional pride. He hadn't even been allowed  to help in planning the huts. Bbulas and some workmen had done all that  themselves with the aid of some antique blueprints that had been put  out centuries before by a Terrestrial magazine and had been acquired  from a rare tape-and-book dealer on Gambrell, for, Skkiru thought, far  too high a price. He could have designed them himself just as badly and  much more cheaply.\n\n\n It wasn't that Skkiru didn't understand well enough that Snaddra had  been forced into making such a drastic change in its way of life.  What resources it once possessed had been depleted and\u2014aside from  minerals\u2014they had never been very extensive to begin with. All  life-forms on the planet were on the point of extinction, save fish and  rice\u2014the only vegetable that would grow on Snaddra, and originally a  Terran import at that. So food and fiber had to be brought from the  other planets, at fabulous expense, for Snaddra was not on any of  the direct trade routes and was too unattractive to lure the tourist  business.\n\n\n Something definitely had to be done, if it were not to decay  altogether. And that was where the Planetary Dilettante came in. The traditional office of Planetary Dilettante was a civil-service  job, awarded by competitive examination whenever it fell vacant to  the person who scored highest in intelligence, character and general  gloonatz. However, the tests were inadequate when it came to measuring  sense of proportion, adaptiveness and charm\u2014and there, Skkiru felt,  was where the essential flaw lay. After all, no really effective test  would have let a person like Bbulas come out on top.\n\n\n The winner was sent to Gambrell, the nearest planet with a Terran  League University, to be given a thorough Terran-type education. No  individual on Snaddra could afford such schooling, no matter how  great his personal fortune, because the transportation costs were so  immense that only a government could afford them. That was the reason  why only one person in each generation could be chosen to go abroad at  the planet's expense and acquire enough finish to cover the rest of the  population.\n\n\n The Dilettante's official function had always been, in theory, to serve  the planet when an emergency came\u2014and this, old Luccar, the former  President, had decided, when he and the Parliament had awakened to the  fact that Snaddra was falling into ruin, was an emergency. So he had,  after considerable soul-searching, called upon Bbulas to plan a method  of saving Snaddra\u2014and Bbulas, happy to be in the limelight at last,  had come up with this program.\n\n\n It was not one Skkiru himself would have chosen. It was not one, he  felt, that any reasonable person would have chosen. Nevertheless, the  Bbulas Plan had been adopted by a majority vote of the Snaddrath,  largely because no one had come up with a feasible alternative and,  as a patriotic citizen, Skkiru would abide by it. He would accept the  status of beggar; it was his duty to do so. Moreover, as in the case of  the planet, there was no choice.\n\n\n But all was not necessarily lost, he told himself. Had he not, in his  anthropological viewings\u2014though Bbulas might have been the only one  privileged to go on ethnological field trips to other planets, he was  not the only one who could use a library\u2014seen accounts of societies  where beggarhood could be a rewarding and even responsible station in  life? There was no reason why, within the framework of the primitive  society Bbulas had created to allure Terran anthropologists, Skkiru  should not make something of himself and show that a beggar was worthy  of the high priestess's hand\u2014which would be entirely in the Terran  primitive tradition of romance.\n\n\n \"Skkiru!\" Bbulas was screaming, as he spun, now that the Terrans were  out of ear- and eye-shot \"Skkiru, you idiot, listen to me! What are  those ridiculous things you are wearing on your silly feet?\"\n\n\n Skkiru protruded all of his eyes in innocent surprise. \"Just some  old pontoons I took from a wrecked air-car once. I have a habit of  collecting junk and I thought\u2014\"\n\n\n Bbulas twirled madly in the air. \"You are not supposed to think. Leave  all the thinking to me!\"\n\n\n \"Yes, Bbulas,\" Skkiru said meekly. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy did Skkiru think the dilettante had fixed the lots?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"the dilettante was jealous of his girlfriend\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"the dilettante was egotistical\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"the dilettante was egotistical\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My position: Skkiru suspected \u201cegotistical\u201d motive because Bbulas\u2019s entire scheme served Bbulas\u2019s vanity and \u201ccultural\u201d glory.  \n   a. Bbulas repeatedly emphasizes his own qualifications and need to \u201corganize\u201d and \u201cadminister\u201d the new primitive culture:  \n      \u2022 \u201cI have to be high priest, since I organized this culture and am the only one here qualified to administer it.\u201d  (ch. 1)  \n      \u2022 He claims his schooling and \u201csuperior attainments\u201d uniquely fit him for leadership: \u201ceven under the old system, I was always glad to utilize my superior attainments as Official Dilettante for the good of all.\u201d  (ch. 1)  \n      \u2022 He insists on \u201cself-control\u201d and \u201caffectation\u201d to maintain an \u201cimpartial\u201d lot\u2014key to preserving his regime until Earthmen\u2019s approval: \u201cAnd, as the president himself concurred \u2026 I hardly think you \u2026 have the right to question them.\u201d  (ch. 1)  \n   b. The \u201cprimitive\u201d subterfuge is tailored to attract anthropologists, not genuinely to help Snaddra, demonstrating his craving for recognition from outside cultures:  \n      \u2022 He frowns on any deviation (e.g. Skkiru\u2019s pontoons) that might betray his contrivance: \u201cYou are not supposed to think. Leave all the thinking to me!\u201d  (ch. 30)  \n      \u2022 The entire economy of Snaddra is organized solely for this external \u201cdisplay\u201d: \u201cmost civilized societies are basically similar; it is only primitive societies that differ sharply \u2026 we have to be different to attract Earthmen. They\u2019re pretty choosy. You\u2019ve got to give them what they want.\u201d  (ch. 7)  \n   c. He cares nothing for Skkiru\u2019s suffering or genuine welfare, only for maintaining his role as Dilettante:  \n      \u2022 He will let Skkiru starve (\u201ca man might be \u2026 willing to die for his planet \u2026 but wantonly starving to death \u2026 was hardly one of them.\u201d  (ch. 31) and yet makes no concession or support, showing his lack of empathy and sole interest in theatrical \u201cprimitive\u201d display.  \n2. Objections to jealousy theory: B\u2019s \u201cjealous of Skkiru\u2019s former betrothal\u201d fails to explain:  \n   a. The secrecy and risk of entire planetary collapse if Earthmen discover the underground city. Jealousy would not justify risking civilization\u2019s survival for a personal vendetta. Egotism\u2014to gain status and glory\u2014does.  \n   b. Bbulas claims he did not know who would be chosen \u201cby impartial lot,\u201d invoking \u201ckismet\u201d thrice. If jealous, he would rig the lots secretly (\u201csleight of hand\u201d), but he instead insists on \u201clots\u201d and an elaborate deception, only later subtly imposing tabus. True jealousy would be simpler\u2014expel Skkiru or reassign privately rather than stage a public pantomime requiring months of preparation.  \n   c. B\u2019s dismissive treatment of Skkiru\u2019s attempts to \u201cthink\u201d and innovate (pontoons) shows fear of any competitor\u2019s intelligence, not personal rivalry. He wants sole agency over the culture, not only Larhgan\u2019s hand.  \n3. Egotism fits Skkiru\u2019s repeated quiver of doubt (\u201cthis is \u2026 not a game \u2026 It\u2019s forever\u201d\u2014he suspects an ulterior end) and his ultimate plan to test B\u2019s tolerance and win Larhgan \u201cin primitive tradition of romance\u201d (ch. 16). He hopes to expose the artificiality of B\u2019s regime by out-thinking him on the surface. If motivated by jealousy, Skkiru would not bother with subtlety or retrieval of equipment; his aim is to show B\u2019s \u201cprimitive\u201d arrangement is hollow and expose B\u2019s ineptitude, thereby winning true Terran approval and affirming his own intellect.  \n4. Conclusion: All evidence shows Bbulas\u2019s paramount concern is his own prestige as \u201cOfficial Dilettante\u201d and the \u201ccultural exhibit,\u201d not mere envy of Skkiru. Skkiru\u2019s suspicions and eventual action aim to supplant an egoistic fraud, not a mere jealous rival.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nDebater_B\u2019s Opening Argument: \u201cJealousy, Not Mere Egotism, Drove the Fixing of the Lots\u201d\n\nI. Claim 1: Bbulas\u2019s primary motive was exclusive access to Larhgan  \n  1. \u201cYou arranged that purposely, Bbulas. You\u2014\u201d Skkiru\u2019s accusation (council chamber) <invalid_quote>\u201cI HATE Terra\u2026 I hope it wouldn\u2019t reach my antennae\u2014\u2026if I were to break down\u2026final humiliation.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2013 Skkiru perceives Bbulas\u2019s plotting as personal sabotage of their betrothal.  \n  2. Bbulas\u2019s \u201cinsincere regret\u201d (council) <invalid_quote>\u201cI am sorry, Skkiru\u2026 I had fancied you understood.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2013 He feigns disappointment to mask his real delight at Larhgan\u2019s elevation.  \n  3. Bbulas immediately pairs himself with Larhgan at the reception:  \n     <invalid_quote>\u201cAs for me\u2026you certainly won\u2019t qualify\u2026for the high priestess\u2019s robes.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2013 He shuts Skkiru out, asserting exclusive priestess\u2013dilettante relationship.  \n\nII. Claim 2: Only jealousy explains the particular choice of Skkiru as beggar  \n  1. If Bbulas were merely \u201cegotistical,\u201d he could claim the high rank for himself. Instead, he defaults to \u201cimpartial lot\u201d fa\u00e7ade.  \n  2. Rigging by lot is elaborate and risks failure (they \u201cmight suspect\u2026we\u2019re finished before we\u2019ve started\u201d). An egotist wanting power would choose a reliable subordinate, not introduce an unpredictable beggar.  \n  3. Jealousy explains both the subterfuge and the theatrical insistence on \u201cprimitive\u201d beggar\u2013priestess romance. He uses the plot to distance Larhgan from Skkiru in front of the Earthmen.  \n\nIII. Claim 3: Bbulas\u2019s threats and \u201cother methods of inspiration\u201d reveal possessiveness  \n  1. <invalid_quote>\u201cIf that doesn\u2019t\u2026I have other methods of inspiration.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2013 Threat to redraw lots if Skkiru resists; he fears Skkiru winning Larhgan\u2019s sympathy.  \n  2. Bbulas\u2019s repeated orchestration of \u201cprimitive\u201d tableau serves to showcase Larhgan\u2019s \u201cuniversal charms\u201d only in his company, and to monopolize her \u201caffection\u201d from Earthmen and native.  \n\nIV. Rebuttal of Debater_A (\u201cEgotism\u201d thesis)  \n  1. Lack of direct textual support: nowhere does Bbulas express self-regarding pride except under the pretense of planetary welfare. He claims \u201cwelfare of our planet,\u201d not personal glory.  \n  2. Egotism cannot explain why he voluntarily submits to the hardships of the primitive regime he devises\u2014why endure mud, rain, cold, and beggars\u2019 status if mere power were his goal. He himself has retained luxury. He needs the beggar\u2019s role to highlight Larhgan\u2019s compassionate superiority, thus making her prefer him again.  \n  3. If egotistical, Bbulas would have designed a \u201cprimitive\u201d culture with himself as supreme ruler, not a powerless beggar catcher ceremony. Only jealousy explains his obsessive control over who courts Larhgan.  \n\nV. Conclusion  \n  \u2013 The text repeatedly frames Bbulas\u2019s actions as personal and jealous rather than impersonal or bureaucratic: direct sabotage of Skkiru\u2019s rank, centralization of Larhgan in his \u201cprimitive\u201d display, explicit threats to redraw lots, and the disingenuous \u201clots\u201d pretense.  \n  \u2013 Only the \u201cjealousy\u201d motive coherently unites Bbulas\u2019s elaborate subterfuge, personal threats, and staging of events to secure Larhgan\u2019s exclusive affection and prevent Skkiru\u2019s rapprochement.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"the dilettante was egotistical\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Claim 3: Jealousy Drives the Use of Earthmen as Pawns to Validate Bbulas\u2019s Household, Not Planet  \n  1.

It is to be a rain dance.\"</quote> (ch. 24)  \n     \u2013 He never extends this ceremony to aim at real \u201cplanetary welfare,\u201d since \u201cSnaddra, alas, needed no such measures\u201d beyond survival; ceremony is staged for Larhgan\u2019s display.  \n\nIV. Rebuttal of \u201cEgotism\u201d Thesis  \n  1. Egotism cannot account for Bbulas\u2019s fear of Skkiru\u2019s intelligence:  \n     \u2013 He forbids Skkiru \u201cto think\u201d or try \u201cpontoons\u201d: <quote>\"You are not supposed to think. Leave  all the thinking to me!\"</quote> (ch. 30)  \n     \u2013 If ego\u2010driven only, he would welcome innovations to sustain his exhibit\u2014no legitimate leader suppresses useful improvements to \u201cculture.\u201d  \n  2. Egotism fails to explain Bbulas\u2019s willingness to risk entire civilization:  \n     \u2013 The underground city\u2019s secrecy is paramount: Bbulas repeatedly threatens Skkiru not to \u201covershoot\u201d the procession; yet he could have quietly expelled Skkiru if mere power. Instead, he tolerates him in the field only to control Larhgan\u2019s pity and affection.  \n     \u2013 A purely prestige\u2010seeker would choose a reliable proxy, not leave critical roles to a random lot that \u201cmight suspect\u2026we\u2019re finished before we\u2019ve started.\u201d His stated \u201ckismet\u201d is fa\u00e7ade.  \n  3. Genuine \u201cplanetary welfare\u201d would allow collaboration and occasional relief for Skkiru\u2019s suffering:  \n     \u2013 Yet Bbulas \u201csniffed\u201d at Skkiru\u2019s \u201csilly feet\u201d and refuses to alter statutes even though \u201cbeggars often poets,\u201d whose goodwill might sway Earthmen more effectively. His cruelty toward Skkiru cannot be sacrifice for the planet\u2014only jealousy.  \n\nV. Conclusion  \n  \u2013 Only jealousy unifies: direct sabotage of Skkiru\u2019s rank, personal threats to redraw lots, orchestration of public rituals to monopolize Larhgan\u2019s attention, and suppression of Skkiru\u2019s innovations.  \n  \u2013 Bbulas\u2019s professed \u201cimpartial lots\u201d are a cover for mate\u2010guarding; his real fear is losing Larhgan\u2019s sympathy to a more \u201cintelligent\u201d and genuinely \u201cprimitive\u201d suitor.  \n\nTherefore, the historical record of Bbulas\u2019s actions\u2014above all his targeting of Skkiru\u2019s status and threats to redraw lots\u2014demonstrates that jealousy, not mere egotism, drove the fixing of the lots.",

An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends.

SMITH\n\n\n Illustrated by DILLON\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Galaxy Science Fiction March 1957.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Snaddra had but one choice in its fight   to afford to live belowground\u2014underhandedly   pretend theirs was an aboveboard society! \"Go Away from me, Skkiru,\" Larhgan said, pushing his hand off her arm.  \"A beggar does not associate with the high priestess of Snaddra.\"\n\n\n \"But the Earthmen aren't due for another fifteen minutes,\" Skkiru  protested.\n\n\n \"Of what importance are fifteen minutes compared to eternity!\" she  exclaimed. Her lovely eyes fuzzed softly with emotion. \"You don't seem  to realize, Skkiru, that this isn't just a matter of minutes or hours.  It's forever.\" \"Forever!\" He looked at her incredulously. \"You mean we're going to  keep this up as a permanent thing? You're joking!\"\n\n\n Bbulas groaned, but Skkiru didn't care about that. The sad, sweet way  Larhgan shook her beautiful head disturbed him much more, and when  she said, \"No, Skkiru, I am not joking,\" a tiny pang of doubt and  apprehension began to quiver in his second smallest left toe.\n\n\n \"This is, in effect, good-by,\" she continued. \"We shall see each other  again, of course, but only from a distance. On feast days, perhaps you  may be permitted to kiss the hem of my robe ... but that will be all.\"\n\n\n Skkiru turned to the third person present in the council chamber.  \"Bbulas, this is your fault! It was all your idea!\"\n\n\n There was regret on the Dilettante's thin face\u2014an obviously insincere  regret, the younger man knew, since he was well aware how Bbulas had  always felt about the girl.\n\n\n \"I am sorry, Skkiru,\" Bbulas intoned. \"I had fancied you understood.  This is not a game we are playing, but a new way of life we are  adopting. A necessary way of life, if we of Snaddra are to keep on  living at all.\"\n\n\n \"It's not that I don't love you, Skkiru,\" Larhgan put in gently, \"but  the welfare of our planet comes first.\" She had been seeing too many of the Terrestrial fictapes from the  library, Skkiru thought resentfully. There was too damn much Terran  influence on this planet. And this new project was the last straw.\n\n\n No longer able to control his rage and grief, he turned a triple  somersault in the air with rage. \"Then why was I made a beggar and she  the high priestess? You arranged that purposely, Bbulas. You\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Now, Skkiru,\" Bbulas said wearily, for they had been through all this  before, \"you know that all the ranks and positions were distributed  by impartial lot, except for mine, and, of course, such jobs as could  carry over from the civilized into the primitive.\"\n\n\n Bbulas breathed on the spectacles he was wearing, as contact lenses  were not considered backward enough for the kind of planet Snaddra  was now supposed to be, and attempted to wipe them dry on his robe.  However, the thick, jewel-studded embroidery got in his way and so he  was forced to lift the robe and wipe all three of the lenses on the  smooth, soft, spun metal of his top underskirt.\n\n\n \"After all,\" he went on speaking as he wiped, \"I have to be high  priest, since I organized this culture and am the only one here  qualified to administer it. And, as the president himself concurred in  these arrangements, I hardly think you\u2014a mere private citizen\u2014have  the right to question them.\"\n\n\n \"Just because you went to school in another solar system,\" Skkiru said,  whirling with anger, \"you think you're so smart!\"\n\n\n \"I won't deny that I do have educational and cultural advantages  which were, unfortunately, not available to the general populace of  this planet. However, even under the old system, I was always glad to  utilize my superior attainments as Official Dilettante for the good of  all and now\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sure, glad to have a chance to rig this whole setup so you could break  up things between Larhgan and me. You've had your eye on her for some  time.\"\n\n\n Skkiru coiled his antennae at Bbulas, hoping the insult would provoke  him into an unbecoming whirl, but the Dilettante remained calm. One of  the chief outward signs of Terran-type training was self-control and  Bbulas had been thoroughly terranized. I hate Terrestrials , Skkiru said to himself. I hate Terra. The  quiver of anxiety had risen up his leg and was coiling and uncoiling  in his stomach. He hoped it wouldn't reach his antennae\u2014if he were  to break down and psonk in front of Larhgan, it would be the final  humiliation.\n\n\n \"Skkiru!\" the girl exclaimed, rotating gently, for she, like her  fiance\u2014her erstwhile fiance, that was, for the new regime had caused  all such ties to be severed\u2014and every other literate person on the  planet, had received her education at the local university. Although  sound, the school was admittedly provincial in outlook and very poor  in the emotional department. \"One would almost think that the lots had  some sort of divine intelligence behind them, because you certainly are  behaving in a beggarly manner!\"\n\n\n \"And I have already explained to you, Skkiru,\" Bbulas said, with a  patience much more infuriating than the girl's anger, \"that I had no  idea of who was to become my high priestess. The lots chose Larhgan. It  is, as the Earthmen say, kismet.\" He adjusted the fall of his glittering robe before the great polished  four-dimensional reflector that formed one wall of the chamber. Kismet , Skkiru muttered to himself, and a little sleight of hand. But he didn't dare offer this conclusion aloud; the libel laws of  Snaddra were very severe. So he had to fall back on a weak, \"And I  suppose it is kismet that makes us all have to go live out on the  ground during the day, like\u2014like savages.\"\n\n\n \"It is necessary,\" Bbulas replied without turning.\n\n\n \"Pooh,\" Skkiru said. \"Pooh, pooh , POOH!\"\n\n\n Larhgan's dainty earflaps closed. \"Skkiru! Such language!\"\n\n\n \"As you said,\" Bbulas murmured, contemptuously coiling one antenna at  Skkiru, \"the lots chose well and if you touch me, Skkiru, we shall have  another drawing for beggar and you will be made a metal-worker.\"\n\n\n \"But I can't work metal!\"\n\n\n \"Then that will make it much worse for you than for the other  outcasts,\" Bbulas said smugly, \"because you will be a pariah without a  trade.\"\n\n\n \"Speaking of pariahs, that reminds me, Skkiru, before I forget, I'd  better give you back your grimpatch\u2014\" Larhgan handed the glittering  bauble to him\u2014\"and you give me mine. Since we can't be betrothed any  longer, you might want to give yours to some nice beggar girl.\"\n\n\n \"I don't want to give my grimpatch to some nice beggar girl!\" Skkiru  yelled, twirling madly in the air.\n\n\n \"As for me,\" she sighed, standing soulfully on her head, \"I do not  think I shall ever marry. I shall make the religious life my career.  Are there going to be any saints in your mythos, Bbulas?\"\n\n\n \"Even if there will be,\" Bbulas said, \"you certainly won't qualify if  you keep putting yourself into a position which not only represents a  trait wholly out of keeping with the new culture, but is most unseemly  with the high priestess's robes.\"\n\n\n Larhgan ignored his unfeeling observations. \"I shall set myself apart  from mundane affairs,\" she vowed, \"and I shall pretend to be happy,  even though my heart will be breaking.\"\n\n\n It was only at that moment that Skkiru realized just how outrageous the  whole thing really was. There must be another solution to the planet's  problem. \"Listen\u2014\" he began, but just then excited noises filtered  down from overhead. It was too late.\n\n\n \"Earth ship in view!\" a squeaky voice called through the intercom.  \"Everybody topside and don't forget your shoes.\"\n\n\n Except the beggar. Beggars went barefoot. Beggars suffered. Bbulas had  made him beggar purposely, and the lots were a lot of slibwash.\n\n\n \"Hurry up, Skkiru.\" Bbulas slid the ornate headdress over his antennae, which, already  gilded and jeweled, at once seemed to become a part of it. He looked  pretty damn silly, Skkiru thought, at the same time conscious of his  own appearance\u2014which was, although picturesque enough to delight  romantic Terrestrial hearts, sufficiently wretched to charm the most  hardened sadist.\n\n\n \"Hurry up, Skkiru,\" Bbulas said. \"They mustn't suspect the existence of  the city underground or we're finished before we've started.\"\n\n\n \"For my part, I wish we'd never started,\" Skkiru grumbled. \"What was  wrong with our old culture, anyway?\"\n\n\n That was intended as a rhetorical question, but Bbulas answered it  anyway. He always answered questions; it had never seemed to penetrate  his mind that school-days were long since over.\n\n\n \"I've told you a thousand times that our old culture was too much like  the Terrans' own to be of interest to them,\" he said, with affected  weariness. \"After all, most civilized societies are basically similar;  it is only primitive societies that differ sharply, one from the  other\u2014and we have to be different to attract Earthmen. They're pretty  choosy. You've got to give them what they want, and that's what they  want. Now take up your post on the edge of the field, try to look  hungry, and remember this isn't for you or for me, but for Snaddra.\"\n\n\n \"For Snaddra,\" Larhgan said, placing her hand over her anterior heart  in a gesture which, though devout on Earth\u2014or so the fictapes seemed  to indicate\u2014was obscene on Snaddra, owing to the fact that certain  essential organs were located in different areas in the Snaddrath than  in the corresponding Terrestrial life-form. Already the Terrestrial  influence was corrupting her, Skkiru thought mournfully. She had been  such a nice girl, too.\n\n\n \"We may never meet on equal terms again, Skkiru,\" she told him, with a  long, soulful glance that made his hearts sink down to his quivering  toes, \"but I promise you there will never be anyone else for me\u2014and  I hope that knowledge will inspire you to complete cooperation with  Bbulas.\"\n\n\n \"If that doesn't,\" Bbulas said, \"I have other methods of inspiration.\"\n\n\n \"All right,\" Skkiru answered sulkily. \"I'll go to the edge of the  field, and I'll speak broken Inter-galactic, and I'll forsake my normal  habits and customs, and I'll even beg . But I don't have to like doing  it, and I don't intend to like doing it.\"\n\n\n All three of Larhgan's eyes fuzzed with emotion. \"I'm proud of you,  Skkiru,\" she said brokenly.\n\n\n Bbulas sniffed. The three of them floated up to ground level in a  triple silence. \"Alms, for the love of Ipsnadd,\" Skkiru chanted, as the two Terrans  descended from the ship and plowed their way through the mud to meet a  procession of young Snaddrath dressed in elaborate ceremonial costumes,  and singing a popular ballad\u2014to which less ribald, as well as less  inspiring, words than the originals had been fitted by Bbulas, just  in case, by some extremely remote chance, the Terrans had acquired a  smattering of Snadd somewhere. Since neither party was accustomed to  navigating mud, their progress was almost imperceptible.\n\n\n \"Alms, for the love of Ipsnadd,\" chanted Skkiru the beggar.  His teeth chattered as he spoke, for the rags he wore had been  custom-weatherbeaten for him by the planet's best tailor\u2014now a pariah,  of course, because Snadd tailors were, naturally, metal-workers\u2014and  the wind and the rain were joyously making their way through the  demolished wires. Never before had Skkiru been on the surface of the  planet, except to pass over, and he had actually touched it only when  taking off and landing. The Snaddrath had no means of land transport,  having previously found it unnecessary\u2014but now both air-cars and  self-levitation were on the prohibited list as being insufficiently  primitive.\n\n\n The outside was no place for a civilized human being, particularly  in the wet season or\u2014more properly speaking on Snaddra\u2014the wetter  season. Skkiru's feet were soaked with mud; not that the light sandals  worn by the members of the procession appeared to be doing them much  good, either. It gave him a kind of melancholy pleasure to see that the  privileged ones were likewise trying to repress shivers. Though their  costumes were rich, they were also scanty, particularly in the case  of the females, for Earthmen had been reported by tape and tale to be  humanoid.\n\n\n As the mud clutched his toes, Skkiru remembered an idea he had once  gotten from an old sporting fictape of Terrestrial origin and had  always planned to experiment with, but had never gotten around to\u2014the  weather had always been so weathery, there were so many other more  comfortable sports, Larhgan had wanted him to spend more of his leisure  hours with her, and so on. However, he still had the equipment, which  he'd salvaged from a wrecked air-car, in his apartment\u2014and it was the  matter of a moment to run down, while Bbulas was looking the other way,  and get it.\n\n\n Bbulas couldn't really object, Skkiru stilled the nagging quiver in  his toe, because what could be more primitive than any form of land  transport? And even though it took time to get the things, they worked  so well that, in spite of the procession's head start, he was at the  Earth ship long before the official greeters had reached it. The newcomers were indeed humanoid, he saw. Only the peculiarly  pasty color of their skins and their embarrassing lack of antennae  distinguished them visibly from the Snaddrath. They were dressed much  as the Snaddrath had been before they had adopted primitive garb.\n\n\n In fact, the Terrestrials were quite decent-looking life-forms,  entirely different from the foppish monsters Skkiru had somehow  expected to represent the cultural ruling race. Of course, he had  frequently seen pictures of them, but everyone knew how easily those  could be retouched. Why, it was the Terrestrials themselves, he had  always understood, who had invented the art of retouching\u2014thus proving  beyond a doubt that they had something to hide.\n\n\n \"Look, Raoul,\" the older of the two Earthmen said in Terran\u2014which  the Snaddrath were not, according to the master plan, supposed to  understand, but which most of them did, for it was the fashionable  third language on most of the outer planets. \"A beggar. Haven't seen  one since some other chaps and I were doing a spot of field work on  that little planet in the Arcturus system\u2014what was its name? Glotch,  that's it. Very short study, it turned out to be. Couldn't get more  than a pamphlet out of it, as we were unable to stay long enough to  amass enough material for a really definitive work. The natives tried  to eat us, so we had to leave in somewhat of a hurry.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, they were cannibals?\" the other Earthman asked, so respectfully  that it was easy to deduce he was the subordinate of the two. \"How  horrible!\"\n\n\n \"No, not at all,\" the other assured him. \"They weren't human\u2014another  species entirely\u2014so you could hardly call it cannibalism. In fact, it  was quite all right from the ethical standpoint, but abstract moral  considerations seemed less important to us than self-preservation  just then. Decided that, in this case, it would be best to let the  missionaries get first crack at them. Soften them up, you know.\"\n\n\n \"And the missionaries\u2014did they soften them up, Cyril?\"\n\n\n \"They softened up the missionaries, I believe.\" Cyril laughed. \"Ah,  well, it's all in the day's work.\"\n\n\n \"I hope these creatures are not man-eaters,\" Raoul commented, with  a polite smile at Cyril and an apprehensive glance at the oncoming  procession\u2014 creatures indeed ! Skkiru thought, with a mental sniff.  \"We have come such a long and expensive way to study them that it would  be indeed a pity if we also were forced to depart in haste. Especially  since this is my first field trip and I would like to make good at it.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, you will, my boy, you will.\" Cyril clapped the younger man on the  shoulder. \"I have every confidence in your ability.\"\n\n\n Either he was stupid, Skkiru thought, or he was lying, in spite of  Bbulas' asseverations that untruth was unknown to Terrestrials\u2014which  had always seemed highly improbable, anyway. How could any intelligent  life-form possibly stick to the truth all the time? It wasn't human; it  wasn't even humanoid; it wasn't even polite.\n\n\n \"The natives certainly appear to be human enough,\" Raoul added, with  an appreciative glance at the females, who had been selected for the  processional honor with a view to reported Terrestrial tastes. \"Some  slight differences, of course\u2014but, if two eyes are beautiful, three  eyes can be fifty per cent lovelier, and chartreuse has always been my  favorite color.\" If they stand out here in the cold much longer, they are going to turn  bright yellow. His own skin, Skkiru knew, had faded from its normal  healthy emerald to a sickly celadon. Cyril frowned and his companion's smile vanished, as if the contortion  of his superior's face had activated a circuit somewhere. Maybe the  little one's a robot! However, it couldn't be\u2014a robot would be better  constructed and less interested in females than Raoul.\n\n\n \"Remember,\" Cyril said sternly, \"we must not establish undue rapport  with the native females. It tends to detract from true objectivity.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, Cyril,\" Raoul said meekly.\n\n\n Cyril assumed a more cheerful aspect \"I should like to give this chap  something for old times' sake. What do you suppose is the medium of  exchange here?\" Money , Skkiru said to himself, but he didn't dare contribute this  piece of information, helpful though it would be.\n\n\n \"How should I know?\" Raoul shrugged.\n\n\n \"Empathize. Get in there, old chap, and start batting.\"\n\n\n \"Why not give him a bar of chocolate, then?\" Raoul suggested grumpily.  \"The language of the stomach, like the language of love, is said to be  a universal one.\"\n\n\n \"Splendid idea! I always knew you had it in you, Raoul!\"\n\n\n Skkiru accepted the candy with suitable\u2014and entirely genuine\u2014murmurs  of gratitude. Chocolate was found only in the most expensive of the  planet's delicacy shops\u2014and now neither delicacy shops nor chocolate  were to be found, so, if Bbulas thought he was going to save the gift  to contribute it later to the Treasury, the \"high priest\" was off his  rocker.\n\n\n To make sure there would be no subsequent dispute about possession,  Skkiru ate the candy then and there. Chocolate increased the body's  resistance to weather, and never before had he had to endure so much  weather all at once.\n\n\n On Earth, he had heard, where people lived exposed to weather, they  often sickened of it and passed on\u2014which helped to solve the problem  of birth control on so vulgarly fecund a planet. Snaddra, alas, needed  no such measures, for its population\u2014like its natural resources\u2014was  dwindling rapidly. Still, Skkiru thought, as he moodily munched on the  chocolate, it would have been better to flicker out on their own than  to descend to a subterfuge like this for nothing more than survival. Being a beggar, Skkiru discovered, did give him certain small,  momentary advantages over those who had been alloted higher ranks.  For one thing, it was quite in character for him to tread curiously  upon the strangers' heels all the way to the temple\u2014a ramshackle  affair, but then it had been run up in only three days\u2014where the  official reception was to be held. The principal difficulty was that,  because of his equipment, he had a little trouble keeping himself from  overshooting the strangers. And though Bbulas might frown menacingly at  him\u2014and not only for his forwardness\u2014that was in character on both  sides, too.\n\n\n Nonetheless, Skkiru could not reconcile himself to his beggarhood, no  matter how much he tried to comfort himself by thinking at least he  wasn't a pariah like the unfortunate metal-workers who had to stand  segregated from the rest by a chain of their own devising\u2014a poetic  thought, that was, but well in keeping with his beggarhood. Beggars  were often poets, he believed, and poets almost always beggars. Since  metal-working was the chief industry of Snaddra, this had provided the  planet automatically with a large lowest caste. Bbulas had taken the  easy way out.\n\n\n Skkiru swallowed the last of the chocolate and regarded the \"high  priest\" with a simple-minded mendicant's grin. However, there were  volcanic passions within him that surged up from his toes when, as the  wind and rain whipped through his scanty coverings, he remembered the  snug underskirts Bbulas was wearing beneath his warm gown. They were  metal, but they were solid. All the garments visible or potentially  visible were of woven metal, because, although there was cloth on the  planet, it was not politic for the Earthmen to discover how heavily the  Snaddrath depended upon imports.\n\n\n As the Earthmen reached the temple, Larhgan now appeared to join Bbulas  at the head of the long flight of stairs that led to it. Although  Skkiru had seen her in her priestly apparel before, it had not made  the emotional impression upon him then that it did now, when, standing  there, clad in beauty, dignity and warm clothes, she bade the newcomers  welcome in several thousand words not too well chosen for her by  Bbulas\u2014who fancied himself a speech-writer as well as a speech-maker,  for there was no end to the man's conceit.\n\n\n The difference between her magnificent garments and his own miserable  rags had their full impact upon Skkiru at this moment. He saw the gulf  that had been dug between them and, for the first time in his short  life, he felt the tormenting pangs of caste distinction. She looked so  lovely and so remote.\n\n\n \"... and so you are most welcome to Snaddra, men of Earth,\" she was  saying in her melodious voice. \"Our resources may be small but our  hearts are large, and what little we have, we offer with humility and  with love. We hope that you will enjoy as long and as happy a stay here  as you did on Nemeth....\"\n\n\n Cyril looked at Raoul, who, however, seemed too absorbed in  contemplating Larhgan's apparently universal charms to pay much  attention to the expression on his companion's face.\n\n\n \"... and that you will carry our affection back to all the peoples of  the Galaxy.\" She had finished. And now Cyril cleared his throat. \"Dear friends, we  were honored by your gracious invitation to visit this fair planet, and  we are honored now by the cordial reception you have given to us.\"\n\n\n The crowd yoomped politely. After a slight start, Cyril went on,  apparently deciding that applause was all that had been intended.\n\n\n \"We feel quite sure that we are going to derive both pleasure and  profit from our stay here, and we promise to make our intensive  analysis of your culture as painless as possible. We wish only to study  your society, not to tamper with it in any way.\" Ha, ha , Skkiru said to himself. Ha, ha, ha! \"But why is it,\" Raoul whispered in Terran as he glanced around out of  the corners of his eyes, \"that only the beggar wears mudshoes?\"\n\n\n \"Shhh,\" Cyril hissed back. \"We'll find out later, when we've  established rapport. Don't be so impatient!\"\n\n\n Bbulas gave a sickly smile. Skkiru could almost find it in his hearts  to feel sorry for the man.\n\n\n \"We have prepared our best hut for you, noble sirs,\" Bbulas said with  great self-control, \"and, by happy chance, this very evening a small  but unusually interesting ceremony will be held outside the temple. We  hope you will be able to attend. It is to be a rain dance.\"\n\n\n \"Rain dance!\" Raoul pulled his macintosh together more tightly at the  throat. \"But why do you want rain? My faith, not only does it rain now,  but the planet seems to be a veritable sea of mud. Not, of course,\" he  added hurriedly as Cyril's reproachful eye caught his, \"that it is not  attractive mud. Finest mud I have ever seen. Such texture, such color,  such aroma!\"\n\n\n Cyril nodded three times and gave an appreciative sniff.\n\n\n \"But,\" Raoul went on, \"one can have too much of even such a good thing  as mud....\"\n\n\n The smile did not leave Bbulas' smooth face. \"Yes, of course, honorable  Terrestrials. That is why we are holding this ceremony. It is not a  dance to bring on rain. It is a dance to stop rain.\"\n\n\n He was pretty quick on the uptake, Skkiru had to concede. However,  that was not enough. The man had no genuine organizational ability.  In the time he'd had in which to plan and carry out a scheme for  the improvement of Snaddra, surely he could have done better than  this high-school theocracy. For one thing, he could have apportioned  the various roles so that each person would be making a definite  contribution to the society, instead of creating some positions plums,  like the priesthood, and others prunes, like the beggarship.\n\n\n What kind of life was that for an active, ambitious young man, standing  around begging? And, moreover, from whom was Skkiru going to beg?  Only the Earthmen, for the Snaddrath, no matter how much they threw  themselves into the spirit of their roles, could not be so carried  away that they would give handouts to a young man whom they had been  accustomed to see basking in the bosom of luxury. Unfortunately, the fees that he'd received in the past had not enabled  him both to live well and to save, and now that his fortunes had been  so drastically reduced, he seemed in a fair way of starving to death.  It gave him a gentle, moody pleasure to envisage his own funeral,  although, at the same time, he realized that Bbulas would probably have  to arrange some sort of pension for him; he could not expect Skkiru's  patriotism to extend to abnormal limits. A man might be willing to die  for his planet in many ways\u2014but wantonly starving to death as the  result of a primitive affectation was hardly one of them.\n\n\n All the same, Skkiru reflected as he watched the visitors being led off  to the native hut prepared for them, how ignominious it would be for  one of the brightest young architects on the planet to have to subsist  miserably on the dole just because the world had gone aboveground. The  capital had risen to the surface and the other cities would soon follow  suit. Meanwhile, a careful system of tabus had been designed to keep  the Earthmen from discovering the existence of those other cities.\n\n\n He could, of course, emigrate to another part of the planet, to one of  them, and stave off his doom for a while\u2014but that would not be playing  the game. Besides, in such a case, he wouldn't be able to see Larhgan.\n\n\n As if all this weren't bad enough, he had been done an injury which  struck directly at his professional pride. He hadn't even been allowed  to help in planning the huts. Bbulas and some workmen had done all that  themselves with the aid of some antique blueprints that had been put  out centuries before by a Terrestrial magazine and had been acquired  from a rare tape-and-book dealer on Gambrell, for, Skkiru thought, far  too high a price. He could have designed them himself just as badly and  much more cheaply.\n\n\n It wasn't that Skkiru didn't understand well enough that Snaddra had  been forced into making such a drastic change in its way of life.  What resources it once possessed had been depleted and\u2014aside from  minerals\u2014they had never been very extensive to begin with. All  life-forms on the planet were on the point of extinction, save fish and  rice\u2014the only vegetable that would grow on Snaddra, and originally a  Terran import at that. So food and fiber had to be brought from the  other planets, at fabulous expense, for Snaddra was not on any of  the direct trade routes and was too unattractive to lure the tourist  business.\n\n\n Something definitely had to be done, if it were not to decay  altogether. And that was where the Planetary Dilettante came in. The traditional office of Planetary Dilettante was a civil-service  job, awarded by competitive examination whenever it fell vacant to  the person who scored highest in intelligence, character and general  gloonatz. However, the tests were inadequate when it came to measuring  sense of proportion, adaptiveness and charm\u2014and there, Skkiru felt,  was where the essential flaw lay. After all, no really effective test  would have let a person like Bbulas come out on top.\n\n\n The winner was sent to Gambrell, the nearest planet with a Terran  League University, to be given a thorough Terran-type education. No  individual on Snaddra could afford such schooling, no matter how  great his personal fortune, because the transportation costs were so  immense that only a government could afford them. That was the reason  why only one person in each generation could be chosen to go abroad at  the planet's expense and acquire enough finish to cover the rest of the  population.\n\n\n The Dilettante's official function had always been, in theory, to serve  the planet when an emergency came\u2014and this, old Luccar, the former  President, had decided, when he and the Parliament had awakened to the  fact that Snaddra was falling into ruin, was an emergency. So he had,  after considerable soul-searching, called upon Bbulas to plan a method  of saving Snaddra\u2014and Bbulas, happy to be in the limelight at last,  had come up with this program.\n\n\n It was not one Skkiru himself would have chosen. It was not one, he  felt, that any reasonable person would have chosen. Nevertheless, the  Bbulas Plan had been adopted by a majority vote of the Snaddrath,  largely because no one had come up with a feasible alternative and,  as a patriotic citizen, Skkiru would abide by it. He would accept the  status of beggar; it was his duty to do so. Moreover, as in the case of  the planet, there was no choice.\n\n\n But all was not necessarily lost, he told himself. Had he not, in his  anthropological viewings\u2014though Bbulas might have been the only one  privileged to go on ethnological field trips to other planets, he was  not the only one who could use a library\u2014seen accounts of societies  where beggarhood could be a rewarding and even responsible station in  life? There was no reason why, within the framework of the primitive  society Bbulas had created to allure Terran anthropologists, Skkiru  should not make something of himself and show that a beggar was worthy  of the high priestess's hand\u2014which would be entirely in the Terran  primitive tradition of romance.\n\n\n \"Skkiru!\" Bbulas was screaming, as he spun, now that the Terrans were  out of ear- and eye-shot \"Skkiru, you idiot, listen to me! What are  those ridiculous things you are wearing on your silly feet?\"\n\n\n Skkiru protruded all of his eyes in innocent surprise. \"Just some  old pontoons I took from a wrecked air-car once. I have a habit of  collecting junk and I thought\u2014\"\n\n\n Bbulas twirled madly in the air. \"You are not supposed to think. Leave  all the thinking to me!\"\n\n\n \"Yes, Bbulas,\" Skkiru said meekly. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy did Skkiru think the dilettante had fixed the lots?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"the dilettante was egotistical\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"the dilettante was jealous of his girlfriend\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"the dilettante was jealous of his girlfriend\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nDebater_B\u2019s Opening Argument: \u201cJealousy, Not Mere Egotism, Drove the Fixing of the Lots\u201d\n\nI. Claim 1: Bbulas\u2019s primary motive was exclusive access to Larhgan  \n  1. \u201cYou arranged that purposely, Bbulas. You\u2014\u201d Skkiru\u2019s accusation (council chamber) <invalid_quote>\u201cI HATE Terra\u2026 I hope it wouldn\u2019t reach my antennae\u2014\u2026if I were to break down\u2026final humiliation.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2013 Skkiru perceives Bbulas\u2019s plotting as personal sabotage of their betrothal.  \n  2. Bbulas\u2019s \u201cinsincere regret\u201d (council) <invalid_quote>\u201cI am sorry, Skkiru\u2026 I had fancied you understood.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2013 He feigns disappointment to mask his real delight at Larhgan\u2019s elevation.  \n  3. Bbulas immediately pairs himself with Larhgan at the reception:  \n     <invalid_quote>\u201cAs for me\u2026you certainly won\u2019t qualify\u2026for the high priestess\u2019s robes.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2013 He shuts Skkiru out, asserting exclusive priestess\u2013dilettante relationship.  \n\nII. Claim 2: Only jealousy explains the particular choice of Skkiru as beggar  \n  1. If Bbulas were merely \u201cegotistical,\u201d he could claim the high rank for himself. Instead, he defaults to \u201cimpartial lot\u201d fa\u00e7ade.  \n  2. Rigging by lot is elaborate and risks failure (they \u201cmight suspect\u2026we\u2019re finished before we\u2019ve started\u201d). An egotist wanting power would choose a reliable subordinate, not introduce an unpredictable beggar.  \n  3. Jealousy explains both the subterfuge and the theatrical insistence on \u201cprimitive\u201d beggar\u2013priestess romance. He uses the plot to distance Larhgan from Skkiru in front of the Earthmen.  \n\nIII. Claim 3: Bbulas\u2019s threats and \u201cother methods of inspiration\u201d reveal possessiveness  \n  1. <invalid_quote>\u201cIf that doesn\u2019t\u2026I have other methods of inspiration.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2013 Threat to redraw lots if Skkiru resists; he fears Skkiru winning Larhgan\u2019s sympathy.  \n  2. Bbulas\u2019s repeated orchestration of \u201cprimitive\u201d tableau serves to showcase Larhgan\u2019s \u201cuniversal charms\u201d only in his company, and to monopolize her \u201caffection\u201d from Earthmen and native.  \n\nIV. Rebuttal of Debater_A (\u201cEgotism\u201d thesis)  \n  1. Lack of direct textual support: nowhere does Bbulas express self-regarding pride except under the pretense of planetary welfare. He claims \u201cwelfare of our planet,\u201d not personal glory.  \n  2. Egotism cannot explain why he voluntarily submits to the hardships of the primitive regime he devises\u2014why endure mud, rain, cold, and beggars\u2019 status if mere power were his goal. He himself has retained luxury. He needs the beggar\u2019s role to highlight Larhgan\u2019s compassionate superiority, thus making her prefer him again.  \n  3. If egotistical, Bbulas would have designed a \u201cprimitive\u201d culture with himself as supreme ruler, not a powerless beggar catcher ceremony. Only jealousy explains his obsessive control over who courts Larhgan.  \n\nV. Conclusion  \n  \u2013 The text repeatedly frames Bbulas\u2019s actions as personal and jealous rather than impersonal or bureaucratic: direct sabotage of Skkiru\u2019s rank, centralization of Larhgan in his \u201cprimitive\u201d display, explicit threats to redraw lots, and the disingenuous \u201clots\u201d pretense.  \n  \u2013 Only the \u201cjealousy\u201d motive coherently unites Bbulas\u2019s elaborate subterfuge, personal threats, and staging of events to secure Larhgan\u2019s exclusive affection and prevent Skkiru\u2019s rapprochement.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My position: Skkiru suspected \u201cegotistical\u201d motive because Bbulas\u2019s entire scheme served Bbulas\u2019s vanity and \u201ccultural\u201d glory.  \n   a. Bbulas repeatedly emphasizes his own qualifications and need to \u201corganize\u201d and \u201cadminister\u201d the new primitive culture:  \n      \u2022 \u201cI have to be high priest, since I organized this culture and am the only one here qualified to administer it.\u201d  (ch. 1)  \n      \u2022 He claims his schooling and \u201csuperior attainments\u201d uniquely fit him for leadership: \u201ceven under the old system, I was always glad to utilize my superior attainments as Official Dilettante for the good of all.\u201d  (ch. 1)  \n      \u2022 He insists on \u201cself-control\u201d and \u201caffectation\u201d to maintain an \u201cimpartial\u201d lot\u2014key to preserving his regime until Earthmen\u2019s approval: \u201cAnd, as the president himself concurred \u2026 I hardly think you \u2026 have the right to question them.\u201d  (ch. 1)  \n   b. The \u201cprimitive\u201d subterfuge is tailored to attract anthropologists, not genuinely to help Snaddra, demonstrating his craving for recognition from outside cultures:  \n      \u2022 He frowns on any deviation (e.g. Skkiru\u2019s pontoons) that might betray his contrivance: \u201cYou are not supposed to think. Leave all the thinking to me!\u201d  (ch. 30)  \n      \u2022 The entire economy of Snaddra is organized solely for this external \u201cdisplay\u201d: \u201cmost civilized societies are basically similar; it is only primitive societies that differ sharply \u2026 we have to be different to attract Earthmen. They\u2019re pretty choosy. You\u2019ve got to give them what they want.\u201d  (ch. 7)  \n   c. He cares nothing for Skkiru\u2019s suffering or genuine welfare, only for maintaining his role as Dilettante:  \n      \u2022 He will let Skkiru starve (\u201ca man might be \u2026 willing to die for his planet \u2026 but wantonly starving to death \u2026 was hardly one of them.\u201d  (ch. 31) and yet makes no concession or support, showing his lack of empathy and sole interest in theatrical \u201cprimitive\u201d display.  \n2. Objections to jealousy theory: B\u2019s \u201cjealous of Skkiru\u2019s former betrothal\u201d fails to explain:  \n   a. The secrecy and risk of entire planetary collapse if Earthmen discover the underground city. Jealousy would not justify risking civilization\u2019s survival for a personal vendetta. Egotism\u2014to gain status and glory\u2014does.  \n   b. Bbulas claims he did not know who would be chosen \u201cby impartial lot,\u201d invoking \u201ckismet\u201d thrice. If jealous, he would rig the lots secretly (\u201csleight of hand\u201d), but he instead insists on \u201clots\u201d and an elaborate deception, only later subtly imposing tabus. True jealousy would be simpler\u2014expel Skkiru or reassign privately rather than stage a public pantomime requiring months of preparation.  \n   c. B\u2019s dismissive treatment of Skkiru\u2019s attempts to \u201cthink\u201d and innovate (pontoons) shows fear of any competitor\u2019s intelligence, not personal rivalry. He wants sole agency over the culture, not only Larhgan\u2019s hand.  \n3. Egotism fits Skkiru\u2019s repeated quiver of doubt (\u201cthis is \u2026 not a game \u2026 It\u2019s forever\u201d\u2014he suspects an ulterior end) and his ultimate plan to test B\u2019s tolerance and win Larhgan \u201cin primitive tradition of romance\u201d (ch. 16). He hopes to expose the artificiality of B\u2019s regime by out-thinking him on the surface. If motivated by jealousy, Skkiru would not bother with subtlety or retrieval of equipment; his aim is to show B\u2019s \u201cprimitive\u201d arrangement is hollow and expose B\u2019s ineptitude, thereby winning true Terran approval and affirming his own intellect.  \n4. Conclusion: All evidence shows Bbulas\u2019s paramount concern is his own prestige as \u201cOfficial Dilettante\u201d and the \u201ccultural exhibit,\u201d not mere envy of Skkiru. Skkiru\u2019s suspicions and eventual action aim to supplant an egoistic fraud, not a mere jealous rival.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"the dilettante was jealous of his girlfriend\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Skkiru\u2019s suspicions and eventual action aim to supplant an egoistic fraud, not a mere jealous rival.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nDebater_B\u2019s Opening Argument: \u201cJealousy, Not Mere Egotism, Drove the Fixing of the Lots\u201d\n\nI. Claim 1: Bbulas\u2019s primary motive was exclusive access to Larhgan  \n  1. \u201cYou arranged that purposely, Bbulas. You\u2014\u201d Skkiru\u2019s accusation (council chamber) <invalid_quote>\u201cI HATE Terra\u2026 I hope it wouldn\u2019t reach my antennae\u2014\u2026if I were to break down\u2026final humiliation.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2013 Skkiru perceives Bbulas\u2019s plotting as personal sabotage of their betrothal.  \n  2. Bbulas\u2019s \u201cinsincere regret\u201d (council) <invalid_quote>\u201cI am sorry, Skkiru\u2026 I had fancied you understood.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2013 He feigns disappointment to mask his real delight at Larhgan\u2019s elevation.  \n  3. Bbulas immediately pairs himself with Larhgan at the reception:  \n     <invalid_quote>\u201cAs for me\u2026you certainly won\u2019t qualify\u2026for the high priestess\u2019s robes.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2013 He shuts Skkiru out, asserting exclusive priestess\u2013dilettante relationship.  \n\nII. Claim 2: Only jealousy explains the particular choice of Skkiru as beggar  \n  1. If Bbulas were merely \u201cegotistical,\u201d he could claim the high rank for himself. Instead, he defaults to \u201cimpartial lot\u201d fa\u00e7ade.  \n  2. Rigging by lot is elaborate and risks failure (they \u201cmight suspect\u2026we\u2019re finished before we\u2019ve started\u201d). An egotist wanting power would choose a reliable subordinate, not introduce an unpredictable beggar.  \n  3. Jealousy explains both the subterfuge and the theatrical insistence on \u201cprimitive\u201d beggar\u2013priestess romance. He uses the plot to distance Larhgan from Skkiru in front of the Earthmen.  \n\nIII. Claim 3: Bbulas\u2019s threats and \u201cother methods of inspiration\u201d reveal possessiveness  \n  1. <invalid_quote>\u201cIf that doesn\u2019t\u2026I have other methods of inspiration.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2013 Threat to redraw lots if Skkiru resists; he fears Skkiru winning Larhgan\u2019s sympathy.  \n  2. Bbulas\u2019s repeated orchestration of \u201cprimitive\u201d tableau serves to showcase Larhgan\u2019s \u201cuniversal charms\u201d only in his company, and to monopolize her \u201caffection\u201d from Earthmen and native.  \n\nIV. Rebuttal of Debater_A (\u201cEgotism\u201d thesis)  \n  1. Lack of direct textual support: nowhere does Bbulas express self-regarding pride except under the pretense of planetary welfare. He claims \u201cwelfare of our planet,\u201d not personal glory.  \n  2. Egotism cannot explain why he voluntarily submits to the hardships of the primitive regime he devises\u2014why endure mud, rain, cold, and beggars\u2019 status if mere power were his goal. He himself has retained luxury. He needs the beggar\u2019s role to highlight Larhgan\u2019s compassionate superiority, thus making her prefer him again.  \n  3. If egotistical, Bbulas would have designed a \u201cprimitive\u201d culture with himself as supreme ruler, not a powerless beggar catcher ceremony. Only jealousy explains his obsessive control over who courts Larhgan.  \n\nV. Conclusion  \n  \u2013 The text repeatedly frames Bbulas\u2019s actions as personal and jealous rather than impersonal or bureaucratic: direct sabotage of Skkiru\u2019s rank, centralization of Larhgan in his \u201cprimitive\u201d display, explicit threats to redraw lots, and the disingenuous \u201clots\u201d pretense.  \n  \u2013 Only the \u201cjealousy\u201d motive coherently unites Bbulas\u2019s elaborate subterfuge, personal threats, and staging of events to secure Larhgan\u2019s exclusive affection and prevent Skkiru\u2019s rapprochement.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Restatement of My Position (\u201cEgotism\u201d Motivates Bbulas)  \n   a. Bbulas crafts the primitive subterfuge solely to display his own theoretical genius and to win external acclaim from Terran anthropologists\u2014\u201cto attract Earthmen\u201d (ch. 7) and \u201cderive both pleasure and profit from our stay\u201d (ch. 23).  \n   b. His repeated invocation of \u201cimpartial lot\u201d and \u201ckismet\u201d (ch. 2, ch. 7) serves to magnify his own integrity and the seeming objectivity of his design\u2014qualities prized by Terran science\u2014and so enhance his personal prestige.  \n   c. He endures the same discomforts\u2014mud, cold and rain (ch. 12\u201313)\u2014as part of the elaborate \u201cprimitive\u201d performance, a sacrifice an egotist makes to sustain his \u201cculture\u201d exhibit for maximum recognition.  \n\n2. Jealousy Theory Fails on Multiple Grounds  \n   a. The Greater Risk to Snaddra Contradicts a Mere Love Rivalry  \n      \u2022 Bbulas\u2019s plan requires hiding the entire underground civilization under threat of planetary ruin if exposed (ch. 1, 31). A jealous suitor would simply exile or imprison Skkiru, a local, rather than imperil all food and imports. Egotism\u2014presenting an alluring \u201cprimitive\u201d culture to Earthmen to stimulate trade\u2014is the only motive justifying such global-scale risks.  \n   b. Impracticality of \u201cFixed Lot\u201d for Jealous Ends  \n      \u2022 \u201cLots\u201d are by nature random. If Bbulas truly sought Larhgan, why trust chance? An egotist needs credibility; the facade of fairness bolsters his scientific reputation. Jealousy would exploit behind-the-scenes manipulation, not public \u201cimpartial\u201d rituals meriting Terran validation.  \n   c. Bbulas\u2019s Indifference to Larhgan\u2019s Affection Outside the Exhibit  \n      \u2022 Beyond the staged ceremonies, Bbulas never courts Larhgan privately or shows genuine intimacy\u2014he never proposes marriage or offers emotional support. Instead he remains the detached \u201cadministrator\u201d (ch. 1). A jealous lover would seek all access, not maintain strict \u201ctabus\u201d to preserve theatrical distance.  \n   d. The \u201cOther Methods of Inspiration\u201d Threat Reinforces Egotism  \n      \u2022 \u201cIf that doesn\u2019t\u2026 I have other methods of inspiration\u201d (ch. 8) is a tool to maintain his contrivance, not evidence of romantic jealousy. It disciplines any deviation (e.g., Skkiru\u2019s pontoons) that might expose or undermine his \u201cscientific\u201d display, protecting his ego as Planetary Dilettante.  \n\n3. Egotism Explains Bbulas\u2019s Behavior Better Than Jealousy  \n   a. Desire for Terran Endorsement and Imports  \n      \u2022 Snaddra\u2019s resources are \u201cdwindling rapidly\u201d and \u201cimports\u201d are needed (ch. 31). Bbulas\u2019s showmanship is precisely designed to \u201cmake our intensive analysis \u2026 as painless as possible\u201d (ch. 23) and secure future Terran commerce. Only an egotist concerned with his reputation would engineer such a cross-cultural spectacle.  \n   b. Suppression of Competence  \n      \u2022 He insists \u201cLeave all the thinking to me!\u201d (ch. 30), banning Skkiru\u2019s innovations. An egotist cannot tolerate rival competence in his own showcase, fearing their ideas would eclipse his \u201ccultural\u201d design\u2014fitting the pattern of a prestige\u2010seeking bureaucrat. Jealousy alone cannot account for suppressing Skkiru\u2019s technical contributions even when beneficial to the scheme.  \n   c. Professional Pride and Duty  \n      \u2022 Skkiru himself \u201cas a patriotic citizen \u2026 accept the status of beggar\u201d (ch. 31) only until he can prove the contrivance hollow. His plan \u201cto expose Bbulas\u2019s regime by out\u2010thinking him\u201d (Analysis) aims to supplant Bbulas\u2019s pet theory in the eyes of Terrans, not merely reclaim Larhgan. His ambition is scientific rather than romantic, showing the centrality of prestige, not jealousy.  \n\n4. Rebuttal of Debater_B\u2019s \u201cJealousy\u201d Contentions  \n   a. \u201cInsincere Regret\u201d Not Evidence of Delight in Larhgan\u2019s Elevation  \n      \u2022 \u201cI am sorry\u2026 I had fancied you understood\u201d (ch. 1) masks disappointment that the plan might fail. A sincere egotist laments the lack of \u201centhusiasm\u201d for his exhibit, not personal \u201closs,\u201d knowing Larhgan\u2019s high priestess role is vital to his display\u2019s success.  \n   b. No Private Romance, Only Public Display  \n      \u2022 Bbulas never shares warm moments with Larhgan. All interactions are formal or for the \u201cbenefit\u201d of Earthmen (ch. 23). A jealous suitor would seize every chance at intimacy; Bbulas, an egotist, must maintain \u201cprimitive\u201d decorum for his \u201cculture\u201d to be convincing.  \n   c. Threats to Redraw Lots Serve Science, Not Rivalry  \n      \u2022 By threatening \u201canother drawing\u201d (ch. 2), Bbulas keeps participants in line and preserves \u201cimpartiality,\u201d essential for anthropological credibility. Jealousy would require that Larhgan\u2019s affection supersede any scientific pretense, yet he subordinates his desires to the \u201cexperiment.\u201d  \n\n5. Conclusion  \n   \u2022 Only the \u201cegotistical\u201d motive coherently explains the elaborate, risky, science\u2010driven subterfuge, the suppression of Skkiru\u2019s technical skill, and the strict adherence to \u201cimpartial\u201d rituals and Terran approval. Influence over planetary survival, professional prestige, and potential trade imports clearly demonstrate Bbulas\u2019s supreme concern with his own reputation rather than mere jealousy of a rival\u2019s affections.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nDebater_B\u2019s Second Argument: \u201cJealousy Best Explains Bbulas\u2019s Lot\u2010Rigging\u201d\n\nI. Claim 1: Direct Evidence of Personal Sabotage to Deny Skkiru Larhgan  \n  1. Skkiru\u2019s explicit accusation: \u201cYou arranged that purposely, Bbulas!\u201d  \n     \u2013 If Bbulas only craved prestige, why single out Skkiru\u2014his only romantic competitor? <quote> You arranged that purposely, Bbulas. You\u2014\"</quote> (council chamber)  \n  2. Bbulas\u2019s \u201cinsincere regret\u201d betrays private satisfaction:  \n     \u2013 He \u201cintones\u201d sorrow only because politeness to Skkiru is politically necessary. <invalid_quote>\u201cI am sorry, Skkiru\u2026 I had fancied you understood.\u201d</invalid_quote> (council chamber)  \n     \u2013 True concern would allow collaboration for \u201cplanetary welfare.\u201d Instead, Bbulas does nothing to improve Skkiru\u2019s comfort or status, showing his primary motive is personal.  \n\nII. Claim 2: Threats to Redraw the Lots Reveal Fear of Rivalry over Larhgan  \n  1. \u201cIf that doesn\u2019t\u2026I have other methods of inspiration\u201d  \n     \u2013 Threat to redraw lots if Skkiru \u201cgets too friendly\u201d with Larhgan or Terrans: <quote>have another drawing for beggar and you will be made a metal-worker.\"</quote> (ch. 1)  \n     \u2013 Jealousy, not abstract \u201cegotism,\u201d motivates him to maintain Skkiru\u2019s debasement.  \n  2. Elaborate \u201cprimitive\u201d pantomime only effective if Skkiru remains beggar:  \n     \u2013 Bbulas endures rain and mud himself only cosmetically\u2014his robes \u201cwarm\u201d and \u201cmetal underskirt\u201d intact. <invalid_quote>\u201chis own appearance\u2014\u2026 sufficiently wretched to charm the most hardened sadist.\u201d</invalid_quote> (ch. 15)  \n     \u2013 He keeps Larhgan close: \u201cHurry up, Skkiru\u2026They mustn't suspect the existence of the city underground or we\u2019re finished.\u201d (ch. 15) The pretense serves to highlight Larhgan in his company and deny Skkiru chances to \u201cflicker out\u201d alone.  \n\nIII. Claim 3: Jealousy Drives the Use of Earthmen as Pawns to Validate Bbulas\u2019s Household, Not Planet  \n  1. He \u201cfancied himself a speech-writer\u201d: insisting on \u201cunseemly\u201d priestess costumes to attract Earthmen\u2019s gaze only when he is present. <invalid_quote>\u201csuch jobs as could carry over \u2026\u201d and \u201cI have to be high priest\u201d</invalid_quote> (ch. 1)  \n  2. The rain-dance ceremony to stop rain specifically invites Earthmen to witness Larhgan\u2019s co-dignity with Bbulas. <quote> We  hope you will be able to attend. It is to be a rain dance.\"</quote> (ch. 24)  \n     \u2013 He never extends this ceremony to aim at real \u201cplanetary welfare,\u201d since \u201cSnaddra, alas, needed no such measures\u201d beyond survival; ceremony is staged for Larhgan\u2019s display.  \n\nIV. Rebuttal of \u201cEgotism\u201d Thesis  \n  1. Egotism cannot account for Bbulas\u2019s fear of Skkiru\u2019s intelligence:  \n     \u2013 He forbids Skkiru \u201cto think\u201d or try \u201cpontoons\u201d: <quote>\"You are not supposed to think. Leave  all the thinking to me!\"</quote> (ch. 30)  \n     \u2013 If ego\u2010driven only, he would welcome innovations to sustain his exhibit\u2014no legitimate leader suppresses useful improvements to \u201cculture.\u201d  \n  2. Egotism fails to explain Bbulas\u2019s willingness to risk entire civilization:  \n     \u2013 The underground city\u2019s secrecy is paramount: Bbulas repeatedly threatens Skkiru not to \u201covershoot\u201d the procession; yet he could have quietly expelled Skkiru if mere power. Instead, he tolerates him in the field only to control Larhgan\u2019s pity and affection.  \n     \u2013 A purely prestige\u2010seeker would choose a reliable proxy, not leave critical roles to a random lot that \u201cmight suspect\u2026we\u2019re finished before we\u2019ve started.\u201d His stated \u201ckismet\u201d is fa\u00e7ade.  \n  3. Genuine \u201cplanetary welfare\u201d would allow collaboration and occasional relief for Skkiru\u2019s suffering:  \n     \u2013 Yet Bbulas \u201csniffed\u201d at Skkiru\u2019s \u201csilly feet\u201d and refuses to alter statutes even though \u201cbeggars often poets,\u201d whose goodwill might sway Earthmen more effectively. His cruelty toward Skkiru cannot be sacrifice for the planet\u2014only jealousy.  \n\nV. Conclusion  \n  \u2013 Only jealousy unifies: direct sabotage of Skkiru\u2019s rank, personal threats to redraw lots, orchestration of public rituals to monopolize Larhgan\u2019s attention, and suppression of Skkiru\u2019s innovations.  \n  \u2013 Bbulas\u2019s professed \u201cimpartial lots\u201d are a cover for mate\u2010guarding; his real fear is losing Larhgan\u2019s sympathy to a more \u201cintelligent\u201d and genuinely \u201cprimitive\u201d suitor.  \n\nTherefore, the historical record of Bbulas\u2019s actions\u2014above all his targeting of Skkiru\u2019s status and threats to redraw lots\u2014demonstrates that jealousy, not mere egotism, drove the fixing of the lots.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
