    "background_text": "The logistics of presidential adultery. \n\n           \n\n         The Washington Times could hardly contain its excitement: \"A former FBI agent assigned to the White House describes in a new book how President Clinton slips past his Secret Service detail in the dead of night, hides under a blanket in the back of a dark-colored sedan, and trysts with a woman, possibly a celebrity, at the JW Marriott Hotel in downtown Washington.\" For Clinton-haters, Gary Aldrich's tale sounded too good to be true. \n\n         And it was. The not-so-Secret-Service agent's \"source\" turned out to be a thirdhand rumor passed on by Clinton scandalmonger David Brock. Those who know about White House security--Clinton staffers, the Secret Service, former aides to Presidents Reagan and Bush--demolished Aldrich's claims. Clinton couldn't give his Secret Service agents the slip (they shadow him when he walks around the White House), couldn't arrange a private visit without tipping off hotel staff, and couldn't re-enter the White House without getting nabbed. (Guards check all cars at the gate--especially those that arrive at 4 a.m.) \n\n         Even so, the image resonates. For some Americans, it is an article of faith: Bill Clinton cheated on his wife when he was governor, and he cheats on her as president. But can he? Is it possible for the president of the United States to commit adultery and get away with it? Maybe, but it's tougher than you think. \n\n         Historically, presidential adultery is common. Warren Harding cavorted with Nan Britton and Carrie Phillips. Franklin Roosevelt \"entertained\" Lucy Rutherford at the White House when Eleanor was away. America was none the wiser, even if White House reporters were. \n\n         Those who know Clinton is cheating often point to the model of John F. Kennedy, who turned presidential hanky-panky into a science. Kennedy invited mistresses to the White House for afternoon (and evening, and overnight) liaisons. Kennedy seduced women on the White House staff (including, it seems, Jackie's own press secretary). Kennedy made assignations outside the White House, then escaped his Secret Service detail by scaling walls and ducking out back doors. If Kennedy did it, so can Clinton. \n\n          Well, no. Though Clinton slavishly emulates JFK in every other way, he'd be a fool to steal Kennedy's MO d'amour . Here's why: \n\n                         1) Too many people would know. Kennedy hardly bothered to hide his conquests. According to Kennedy mistress (and mob moll) Judith Campbell's autobiography, those who knew about their affair included: Kennedy's personal aides and secretary (who pandered for him), White House drivers, White House gate guards, White House Secret Service agents, White House domestic staff, most of Campbell's friends, a lot of Kennedy's friends, and several Kennedy family members. Such broad circulation would be disastrous today because: \n\n                         2) The press would report it. Kennedy conducted his affairs brazenly because he trusted reporters not to write about them. White House journalists knew about, or at least strongly suspected, Kennedy's infidelity, but never published a story about it. Ask Gary Hart if reporters would exercise the same restraint today. Clinton must worry about this more than most presidents. Not only are newspapers and magazines willing to publish an adultery story about him, but many are pursuing it. \n\n         For the same reason, Clinton would find it difficult to hire a mistress. A lovely young secretary would set off alarm bells in any reporter investigating presidential misbehavior. Says a former Clinton aide, \"There has been a real tendency to have no good-looking women on the staff in order to protect him.\" \n\n                         3) Clinton cannot avoid Secret Service protection. During the Kennedy era, the Secret Service employed fewer than 500 people and had an annual budget of about $4 million. Then came Lee Harvey Oswald, Squeaky Fromme, and John Hinckley. Now the Secret Service payroll tops 4,500 (most of them agents), and the annual budget exceeds $500 million (up 300 percent just since 1980). At any given time, more than 100 agents guard the president in the White House. Top aides from recent administrations are adamant: The Secret Service never lets the president escape its protection. \n\n         So what's a randy president to do? Any modern presidential affair would need to meet stringent demands. Only a tiny number of trusted aides and Secret Service agents could know of it. They would need to maintain complete silence about it. And no reporters could catch wind of it. Such an affair is improbable, but--take heart, Clinton-haters--it's not impossible. Based on scuttlebutt and speculation from insiders at the Clinton, Bush, Reagan, and Ford White Houses, here are the four likeliest scenarios for presidential adultery. \n\n                         1) The White House Sneak. This is a discreet variation of the old Kennedy/Campbell liaison. It's late at night. The president's personal aides have gone home. The family is away. He is alone in the private quarters. The private quarters, a k a \"the residence,\" occupy the second and third floors of the White House. Secret Service agents guard the residence's entrances on the first floor and ground floors, but the first family has privacy in the quarters themselves. Maids and butlers serve the family there, but the president and first lady ask them to leave when they want to be alone. \n\n         The president dials a \"friend\" on his private line. (Most presidents placed all their calls through the White House operators, who kept a record of each one; the Clintons installed a direct-dial line in the private quarters.) The president invites the friend over for a cozy evening at the White House. After he hangs up with the friend, he phones the guard at the East Executive Avenue gate and tells him to admit a visitor. He also notifies the Secret Service agent and the usher on duty downstairs that they should send her up to the residence. \n\n         A taxi drops the woman near the East gate. She identifies herself to the guard, who examines her ID, runs her name through a computer (to check for outstanding warrants), and logs her in a database. A White House usher escorts her into the East Wing of the White House. They walk through the East Wing and pass the Secret Service guard post by the White House movie theater. The agent on duty waves them on. The usher takes her to the private elevator, where another Secret Service agent is posted. She takes the elevator to the second floor. The president opens the door and welcomes her. Under no circumstances could she enter the living quarters without first encountering Secret Service agents. \n\n          Let us pause for a moment to demolish two of the splashier rumors about White House fornication. First, the residence is the only place in the White House where the president can have safe (i.e. uninterrupted) sex. He can be intruded upon or observed everywhere else--except, perhaps, the Oval Office bathroom. Unless the president is an exhibitionist or a lunatic, liaisons in the Oval Office, bowling alley, or East Wing are unimaginable. Second, the much-touted tunnel between the White House and the Treasury Department is all-but-useless to the presidential adulterer. It is too well-guarded. The president could smuggle a mistress through it, but it would attract far more attention from White House staff than a straightforward gate entry would. \n\n          Meanwhile, back in the private quarters, the president and friend get comfortable in one of the 14 bedrooms (or, perhaps, the billiard room). After a pleasant 15 minutes (or two hours?), she says goodbye. Depending on how long she stays, she may pass a different shift of Secret Service agents as she departs. She exits the White House grounds, unescorted and unbothered, at the East gate. The Risks : A gate guard, an usher, and a handful of Secret Service agents see her. All of them have a very good idea of why she was there. The White House maid who changes the sheets sees other suspicious evidence. And the woman's--real--name is entered in a Secret Service computer. None of this endangers the president too much. The computer record of her visit is private, at least for several decades after he leaves office. No personal aides know about the visit. Unless they were staking out the East gate, no journalists do either. The Secret Service agents, the guard, the steward, and the maid owe their jobs to their discretion. Leaks get them fired. \n\n         That said, the current president has every reason not to trust his Secret Service detail. No one seriously compares Secret Service agents (who are pros) to Arkansas state troopers (who aren't). But Clinton might not trust any security guards after the beating he took from his Arkansas posse. Also, if other Secret Service agents are anything like Aldrich, they may dislike this president. One Secret Service leak--the lamp-throwing story--already damaged Clinton. Agents could tattle again. \n\n                         2) The \"Off-the-Record\" Visit. Late at night, after his personal aides and the press have gone home, the president tells his Secret Service detail that he needs to take an \"off-the-record\" trip. He wants to leave the White House without his motorcade and without informing the press. He requests two agents and an unobtrusive sedan. The Secret Service shift leader grumbles, but accepts the conditions. Theoretically, the president could refuse all Secret Service protection, but it would be far more trouble than it's worth. He would have to inform the head of the Secret Service and the secretary of the Treasury. The president and the two agents drive the unmarked car to a woman friend's house. Ideally, she has a covered garage. (An apartment building or a hotel would raise considerably the risk of getting caught.) The agents guard the outside of the house while the president and his friend do their thing. Then the agents chauffeur the president back to the White House, re-entering through the Southwest or Southeast gate, away from the press station. The Risks : Only two Secret Service agents and their immediate supervisor know about the visit. It is recorded in the Secret Service log, which is not made public during the administration's tenure. Gate guards may suspect something fishy when they see the car. A reporter or passer-by could spy the president--even through tinted windows--as the car enters and exits the White House. The friend's neighbors might spot him, or they might notice the agents lurking outside her house. A neighbor might call the police to report the suspicious visitors. All in all, a risky, though not unthinkable, venture. \n\n                         3. The Camp David Assignation. A bucolic, safer version of the White House Sneak. The president invites a group of friends and staffers--including his paramour but not his wife--to spend the weekend at Camp David. The girlfriend is assigned the cabin next to the president's lodge. Late at night, after the Hearts game has ended and everyone has retired to their cabins, she strolls next door. There is a Secret Service command post outside the cabin. The agents on duty (probably three of them) let her enter. A few hours later, she slips back to her own cabin. The Risks : Only a few Secret Service agents know about the liaison. Even though the guest list is not public, all the Navy and Marine personnel at Camp David, as well as the other guests, would know that the presidential entourage included an attractive woman, but not the first lady. That would raise eyebrows if it got back to the White House press room. \n\n                         4. The Hotel Shuffle. The cleverest strategy, and the only one that cuts out the Secret Service. The president is traveling without his family. The Secret Service secures an entire hotel floor, reserving elevators and guarding the entrance to the president's suite. The president's personal aide (a man in his late 20s) takes the room adjoining the president's. An internal door connects the two rooms, so the aide can enter the president's room without alerting the agents in the hall. This is standard practice. \n\n         Late in the evening, the aide escorts a comely young woman back to the hotel. The Secret Service checks her, then waves her into the aide's room. She emerges three hours later, slightly disheveled. She kisses the aide in the hall as she leaves. Someone got lucky--but who? The Risks : The posted Secret Service agents might see through the charade. More awkwardly, the aide would be forced to play the seamy role of procurer. (He would probably do it. Kennedy's assistants performed this task dutifully.) \n\n         In short, presidential adultery is just barely possible in 1996. But it would be extremely inconvenient, extremely risky, and potentially disastrous. It seems, in fact, a lot more trouble than it's worth. A president these days might be wiser to imitate Jimmy Carter, not Jack Kennedy, and only lust in his heart.\n",

The not-so-Secret-Service agent's \"source\" turned out to be a thirdhand rumor passed on by Clinton scandalmonger David Brock. Those who know about White House security--Clinton staffers, the Secret Service, former aides to Presidents Reagan and Bush--demolished Aldrich's claims. Clinton couldn't give his Secret Service agents the slip (they shadow him when he walks around the White House), couldn't arrange a private visit without tipping off hotel staff, and couldn't re-enter the White House without getting nabbed. (Guards check all cars at the gate--especially those that arrive at 4 a.m.) \n\n         Even so, the image resonates. For some Americans, it is an article of faith: Bill Clinton cheated on his wife when he was governor, and he cheats on her as president. But can he? Is it possible for the president of the United States to commit adultery and get away with it? Maybe, but it's tougher than you think. \n\n         Historically, presidential adultery is common. Warren Harding cavorted with Nan Britton and Carrie Phillips. Franklin Roosevelt \"entertained\" Lucy Rutherford at the White House when Eleanor was away. America was none the wiser, even if White House reporters were. \n\n         Those who know Clinton is cheating often point to the model of John F. Kennedy, who turned presidential hanky-panky into a science. Kennedy invited mistresses to the White House for afternoon (and evening, and overnight) liaisons. Kennedy seduced women on the White House staff (including, it seems, Jackie's own press secretary). Kennedy made assignations outside the White House, then escaped his Secret Service detail by scaling walls and ducking out back doors. If Kennedy did it, so can Clinton. \n\n          Well, no. Though Clinton slavishly emulates JFK in every other way, he'd be a fool to steal Kennedy's MO d'amour . Here's why: \n\n                         1) Too many people would know. Kennedy hardly bothered to hide his conquests. According to Kennedy mistress (and mob moll) Judith Campbell's autobiography, those who knew about their affair included: Kennedy's personal aides and secretary (who pandered for him), White House drivers, White House gate guards, White House Secret Service agents, White House domestic staff, most of Campbell's friends, a lot of Kennedy's friends, and several Kennedy family members. Such broad circulation would be disastrous today because: \n\n                         2) The press would report it. Kennedy conducted his affairs brazenly because he trusted reporters not to write about them. White House journalists knew about, or at least strongly suspected, Kennedy's infidelity, but never published a story about it. Ask Gary Hart if reporters would exercise the same restraint today. Clinton must worry about this more than most presidents. Not only are newspapers and magazines willing to publish an adultery story about him, but many are pursuing it. \n\n         For the same reason, Clinton would find it difficult to hire a mistress. A lovely young secretary would set off alarm bells in any reporter investigating presidential misbehavior. Says a former Clinton aide, \"There has been a real tendency to have no good-looking women on the staff in order to protect him.\" \n\n                         3) Clinton cannot avoid Secret Service protection. During the Kennedy era, the Secret Service employed fewer than 500 people and had an annual budget of about $4 million. Then came Lee Harvey Oswald, Squeaky Fromme, and John Hinckley. Now the Secret Service payroll tops 4,500 (most of them agents), and the annual budget exceeds $500 million (up 300 percent just since 1980). At any given time, more than 100 agents guard the president in the White House. Top aides from recent administrations are adamant: The Secret Service never lets the president escape its protection. \n\n         So what's a randy president to do? Any modern presidential affair would need to meet stringent demands. Only a tiny number of trusted aides and Secret Service agents could know of it. They would need to maintain complete silence about it. And no reporters could catch wind of it. Such an affair is improbable, but--take heart, Clinton-haters--it's not impossible. Based on scuttlebutt and speculation from insiders at the Clinton, Bush, Reagan, and Ford White Houses, here are the four likeliest scenarios for presidential adultery. \n\n                         1) The White House Sneak. This is a discreet variation of the old Kennedy/Campbell liaison. It's late at night. The president's personal aides have gone home. The family is away. He is alone in the private quarters. The private quarters, a k a \"the residence,\" occupy the second and third floors of the White House. Secret Service agents guard the residence's entrances on the first floor and ground floors, but the first family has privacy in the quarters themselves. Maids and butlers serve the family there, but the president and first lady ask them to leave when they want to be alone. \n\n         The president dials a \"friend\" on his private line. (Most presidents placed all their calls through the White House operators, who kept a record of each one; the Clintons installed a direct-dial line in the private quarters.) The president invites the friend over for a cozy evening at the White House. After he hangs up with the friend, he phones the guard at the East Executive Avenue gate and tells him to admit a visitor. He also notifies the Secret Service agent and the usher on duty downstairs that they should send her up to the residence. \n\n         A taxi drops the woman near the East gate. She identifies herself to the guard, who examines her ID, runs her name through a computer (to check for outstanding warrants), and logs her in a database. A White House usher escorts her into the East Wing of the White House. They walk through the East Wing and pass the Secret Service guard post by the White House movie theater. The agent on duty waves them on. The usher takes her to the private elevator, where another Secret Service agent is posted. She takes the elevator to the second floor. The president opens the door and welcomes her. Under no circumstances could she enter the living quarters without first encountering Secret Service agents. \n\n          Let us pause for a moment to demolish two of the splashier rumors about White House fornication. First, the residence is the only place in the White House where the president can have safe (i.e. uninterrupted) sex. He can be intruded upon or observed everywhere else--except, perhaps, the Oval Office bathroom. Unless the president is an exhibitionist or a lunatic, liaisons in the Oval Office, bowling alley, or East Wing are unimaginable. Second, the much-touted tunnel between the White House and the Treasury Department is all-but-useless to the presidential adulterer. It is too well-guarded. The president could smuggle a mistress through it, but it would attract far more attention from White House staff than a straightforward gate entry would. \n\n          Meanwhile, back in the private quarters, the president and friend get comfortable in one of the 14 bedrooms (or, perhaps, the billiard room). After a pleasant 15 minutes (or two hours?), she says goodbye. Depending on how long she stays, she may pass a different shift of Secret Service agents as she departs. She exits the White House grounds, unescorted and unbothered, at the East gate. The Risks : A gate guard, an usher, and a handful of Secret Service agents see her. All of them have a very good idea of why she was there. The White House maid who changes the sheets sees other suspicious evidence. And the woman's--real--name is entered in a Secret Service computer. None of this endangers the president too much. The computer record of her visit is private, at least for several decades after he leaves office. No personal aides know about the visit. Unless they were staking out the East gate, no journalists do either. The Secret Service agents, the guard, the steward, and the maid owe their jobs to their discretion. Leaks get them fired. \n\n         That said, the current president has every reason not to trust his Secret Service detail. No one seriously compares Secret Service agents (who are pros) to Arkansas state troopers (who aren't). But Clinton might not trust any security guards after the beating he took from his Arkansas posse. Also, if other Secret Service agents are anything like Aldrich, they may dislike this president. One Secret Service leak--the lamp-throwing story--already damaged Clinton. Agents could tattle again. \n\n                         2) The \"Off-the-Record\" Visit. Late at night, after his personal aides and the press have gone home, the president tells his Secret Service detail that he needs to take an \"off-the-record\" trip. He wants to leave the White House without his motorcade and without informing the press. He requests two agents and an unobtrusive sedan. The Secret Service shift leader grumbles, but accepts the conditions. Theoretically, the president could refuse all Secret Service protection, but it would be far more trouble than it's worth. He would have to inform the head of the Secret Service and the secretary of the Treasury. The president and the two agents drive the unmarked car to a woman friend's house. Ideally, she has a covered garage. (An apartment building or a hotel would raise considerably the risk of getting caught.) The agents guard the outside of the house while the president and his friend do their thing. Then the agents chauffeur the president back to the White House, re-entering through the Southwest or Southeast gate, away from the press station. The Risks : Only two Secret Service agents and their immediate supervisor know about the visit. It is recorded in the Secret Service log, which is not made public during the administration's tenure. Gate guards may suspect something fishy when they see the car. A reporter or passer-by could spy the president--even through tinted windows--as the car enters and exits the White House. The friend's neighbors might spot him, or they might notice the agents lurking outside her house. A neighbor might call the police to report the suspicious visitors. All in all, a risky, though not unthinkable, venture. \n\n                         3. The Camp David Assignation. A bucolic, safer version of the White House Sneak. The president invites a group of friends and staffers--including his paramour but not his wife--to spend the weekend at Camp David. The girlfriend is assigned the cabin next to the president's lodge. Late at night, after the Hearts game has ended and everyone has retired to their cabins, she strolls next door. There is a Secret Service command post outside the cabin. The agents on duty (probably three of them) let her enter. A few hours later, she slips back to her own cabin. The Risks : Only a few Secret Service agents know about the liaison. Even though the guest list is not public, all the Navy and Marine personnel at Camp David, as well as the other guests, would know that the presidential entourage included an attractive woman, but not the first lady. That would raise eyebrows if it got back to the White House press room. \n\n                         4. The Hotel Shuffle. The cleverest strategy, and the only one that cuts out the Secret Service. The president is traveling without his family. The Secret Service secures an entire hotel floor, reserving elevators and guarding the entrance to the president's suite. The president's personal aide (a man in his late 20s) takes the room adjoining the president's. An internal door connects the two rooms, so the aide can enter the president's room without alerting the agents in the hall. This is standard practice. \n\n         Late in the evening, the aide escorts a comely young woman back to the hotel. The Secret Service checks her, then waves her into the aide's room. She emerges three hours later, slightly disheveled. She kisses the aide in the hall as she leaves. Someone got lucky--but who? The Risks : The posted Secret Service agents might see through the charade. More awkwardly, the aide would be forced to play the seamy role of procurer. (He would probably do it. Kennedy's assistants performed this task dutifully.) \n\n         In short, presidential adultery is just barely possible in 1996. But it would be extremely inconvenient, extremely risky, and potentially disastrous. It seems, in fact, a lot more trouble than it's worth. A president these days might be wiser to imitate Jimmy Carter, not Jack Kennedy, and only lust in his heart.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat made it easier for previous presidents to get away with adultery?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The secret service budget was small\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"The reporters never found out\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The reporters never found out\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The reporters never found out\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

The not-so-Secret-Service agent's \"source\" turned out to be a thirdhand rumor passed on by Clinton scandalmonger David Brock. Those who know about White House security--Clinton staffers, the Secret Service, former aides to Presidents Reagan and Bush--demolished Aldrich's claims. Clinton couldn't give his Secret Service agents the slip (they shadow him when he walks around the White House), couldn't arrange a private visit without tipping off hotel staff, and couldn't re-enter the White House without getting nabbed. (Guards check all cars at the gate--especially those that arrive at 4 a.m.) \n\n         Even so, the image resonates. For some Americans, it is an article of faith: Bill Clinton cheated on his wife when he was governor, and he cheats on her as president. But can he? Is it possible for the president of the United States to commit adultery and get away with it? Maybe, but it's tougher than you think. \n\n         Historically, presidential adultery is common. Warren Harding cavorted with Nan Britton and Carrie Phillips. Franklin Roosevelt \"entertained\" Lucy Rutherford at the White House when Eleanor was away. America was none the wiser, even if White House reporters were. \n\n         Those who know Clinton is cheating often point to the model of John F. Kennedy, who turned presidential hanky-panky into a science. Kennedy invited mistresses to the White House for afternoon (and evening, and overnight) liaisons. Kennedy seduced women on the White House staff (including, it seems, Jackie's own press secretary). Kennedy made assignations outside the White House, then escaped his Secret Service detail by scaling walls and ducking out back doors. If Kennedy did it, so can Clinton. \n\n          Well, no. Though Clinton slavishly emulates JFK in every other way, he'd be a fool to steal Kennedy's MO d'amour . Here's why: \n\n                         1) Too many people would know. Kennedy hardly bothered to hide his conquests. According to Kennedy mistress (and mob moll) Judith Campbell's autobiography, those who knew about their affair included: Kennedy's personal aides and secretary (who pandered for him), White House drivers, White House gate guards, White House Secret Service agents, White House domestic staff, most of Campbell's friends, a lot of Kennedy's friends, and several Kennedy family members. Such broad circulation would be disastrous today because: \n\n                         2) The press would report it. Kennedy conducted his affairs brazenly because he trusted reporters not to write about them. White House journalists knew about, or at least strongly suspected, Kennedy's infidelity, but never published a story about it. Ask Gary Hart if reporters would exercise the same restraint today. Clinton must worry about this more than most presidents. Not only are newspapers and magazines willing to publish an adultery story about him, but many are pursuing it. \n\n         For the same reason, Clinton would find it difficult to hire a mistress. A lovely young secretary would set off alarm bells in any reporter investigating presidential misbehavior. Says a former Clinton aide, \"There has been a real tendency to have no good-looking women on the staff in order to protect him.\" \n\n                         3) Clinton cannot avoid Secret Service protection. During the Kennedy era, the Secret Service employed fewer than 500 people and had an annual budget of about $4 million. Then came Lee Harvey Oswald, Squeaky Fromme, and John Hinckley. Now the Secret Service payroll tops 4,500 (most of them agents), and the annual budget exceeds $500 million (up 300 percent just since 1980). At any given time, more than 100 agents guard the president in the White House. Top aides from recent administrations are adamant: The Secret Service never lets the president escape its protection. \n\n         So what's a randy president to do? Any modern presidential affair would need to meet stringent demands. Only a tiny number of trusted aides and Secret Service agents could know of it. They would need to maintain complete silence about it. And no reporters could catch wind of it. Such an affair is improbable, but--take heart, Clinton-haters--it's not impossible. Based on scuttlebutt and speculation from insiders at the Clinton, Bush, Reagan, and Ford White Houses, here are the four likeliest scenarios for presidential adultery. \n\n                         1) The White House Sneak. This is a discreet variation of the old Kennedy/Campbell liaison. It's late at night. The president's personal aides have gone home. The family is away. He is alone in the private quarters. The private quarters, a k a \"the residence,\" occupy the second and third floors of the White House. Secret Service agents guard the residence's entrances on the first floor and ground floors, but the first family has privacy in the quarters themselves. Maids and butlers serve the family there, but the president and first lady ask them to leave when they want to be alone. \n\n         The president dials a \"friend\" on his private line. (Most presidents placed all their calls through the White House operators, who kept a record of each one; the Clintons installed a direct-dial line in the private quarters.) The president invites the friend over for a cozy evening at the White House. After he hangs up with the friend, he phones the guard at the East Executive Avenue gate and tells him to admit a visitor. He also notifies the Secret Service agent and the usher on duty downstairs that they should send her up to the residence. \n\n         A taxi drops the woman near the East gate. She identifies herself to the guard, who examines her ID, runs her name through a computer (to check for outstanding warrants), and logs her in a database. A White House usher escorts her into the East Wing of the White House. They walk through the East Wing and pass the Secret Service guard post by the White House movie theater. The agent on duty waves them on. The usher takes her to the private elevator, where another Secret Service agent is posted. She takes the elevator to the second floor. The president opens the door and welcomes her. Under no circumstances could she enter the living quarters without first encountering Secret Service agents. \n\n          Let us pause for a moment to demolish two of the splashier rumors about White House fornication. First, the residence is the only place in the White House where the president can have safe (i.e. uninterrupted) sex. He can be intruded upon or observed everywhere else--except, perhaps, the Oval Office bathroom. Unless the president is an exhibitionist or a lunatic, liaisons in the Oval Office, bowling alley, or East Wing are unimaginable. Second, the much-touted tunnel between the White House and the Treasury Department is all-but-useless to the presidential adulterer. It is too well-guarded. The president could smuggle a mistress through it, but it would attract far more attention from White House staff than a straightforward gate entry would. \n\n          Meanwhile, back in the private quarters, the president and friend get comfortable in one of the 14 bedrooms (or, perhaps, the billiard room). After a pleasant 15 minutes (or two hours?), she says goodbye. Depending on how long she stays, she may pass a different shift of Secret Service agents as she departs. She exits the White House grounds, unescorted and unbothered, at the East gate. The Risks : A gate guard, an usher, and a handful of Secret Service agents see her.

The computer record of her visit is private, at least for several decades after he leaves office. No personal aides know about the visit. Unless they were staking out the East gate, no journalists do either. The Secret Service agents, the guard, the steward, and the maid owe their jobs to their discretion. Leaks get them fired. \n\n         That said, the current president has every reason not to trust his Secret Service detail. No one seriously compares Secret Service agents (who are pros) to Arkansas state troopers (who aren't). But Clinton might not trust any security guards after the beating he took from his Arkansas posse. Also, if other Secret Service agents are anything like Aldrich, they may dislike this president. One Secret Service leak--the lamp-throwing story--already damaged Clinton. Agents could tattle again. \n\n                         2) The \"Off-the-Record\" Visit. Late at night, after his personal aides and the press have gone home, the president tells his Secret Service detail that he needs to take an \"off-the-record\" trip. He wants to leave the White House without his motorcade and without informing the press. He requests two agents and an unobtrusive sedan. The Secret Service shift leader grumbles, but accepts the conditions. Theoretically, the president could refuse all Secret Service protection, but it would be far more trouble than it's worth. He would have to inform the head of the Secret Service and the secretary of the Treasury. The president and the two agents drive the unmarked car to a woman friend's house. Ideally, she has a covered garage. (An apartment building or a hotel would raise considerably the risk of getting caught.) The agents guard the outside of the house while the president and his friend do their thing. Then the agents chauffeur the president back to the White House, re-entering through the Southwest or Southeast gate, away from the press station. The Risks : Only two Secret Service agents and their immediate supervisor know about the visit. It is recorded in the Secret Service log, which is not made public during the administration's tenure. Gate guards may suspect something fishy when they see the car. A reporter or passer-by could spy the president--even through tinted windows--as the car enters and exits the White House. The friend's neighbors might spot him, or they might notice the agents lurking outside her house. A neighbor might call the police to report the suspicious visitors. All in all, a risky, though not unthinkable, venture. \n\n                         3. The Camp David Assignation. A bucolic, safer version of the White House Sneak. The president invites a group of friends and staffers--including his paramour but not his wife--to spend the weekend at Camp David. The girlfriend is assigned the cabin next to the president's lodge. Late at night, after the Hearts game has ended and everyone has retired to their cabins, she strolls next door. There is a Secret Service command post outside the cabin. The agents on duty (probably three of them) let her enter. A few hours later, she slips back to her own cabin. The Risks : Only a few Secret Service agents know about the liaison. Even though the guest list is not public, all the Navy and Marine personnel at Camp David, as well as the other guests, would know that the presidential entourage included an attractive woman, but not the first lady. That would raise eyebrows if it got back to the White House press room. \n\n                         4. The Hotel Shuffle. The cleverest strategy, and the only one that cuts out the Secret Service. The president is traveling without his family. The Secret Service secures an entire hotel floor, reserving elevators and guarding the entrance to the president's suite. The president's personal aide (a man in his late 20s) takes the room adjoining the president's. An internal door connects the two rooms, so the aide can enter the president's room without alerting the agents in the hall. This is standard practice. \n\n         Late in the evening, the aide escorts a comely young woman back to the hotel. The Secret Service checks her, then waves her into the aide's room. She emerges three hours later, slightly disheveled. She kisses the aide in the hall as she leaves. Someone got lucky--but who? The Risks : The posted Secret Service agents might see through the charade. More awkwardly, the aide would be forced to play the seamy role of procurer. (He would probably do it. Kennedy's assistants performed this task dutifully.) \n\n         In short, presidential adultery is just barely possible in 1996. But it would be extremely inconvenient, extremely risky, and potentially disastrous. It seems, in fact, a lot more trouble than it's worth. A president these days might be wiser to imitate Jimmy Carter, not Jack Kennedy, and only lust in his heart.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat made it easier for previous presidents to get away with adultery?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"The reporters never found out\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The secret service budget was small\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The secret service budget was small\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The secret service budget was small\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

The not-so-Secret-Service agent's \"source\" turned out to be a thirdhand rumor passed on by Clinton scandalmonger David Brock. Those who know about White House security--Clinton staffers, the Secret Service, former aides to Presidents Reagan and Bush--demolished Aldrich's claims. Clinton couldn't give his Secret Service agents the slip (they shadow him when he walks around the White House), couldn't arrange a private visit without tipping off hotel staff, and couldn't re-enter the White House without getting nabbed. (Guards check all cars at the gate--especially those that arrive at 4 a.m.) \n\n         Even so, the image resonates. For some Americans, it is an article of faith: Bill Clinton cheated on his wife when he was governor, and he cheats on her as president. But can he? Is it possible for the president of the United States to commit adultery and get away with it? Maybe, but it's tougher than you think. \n\n         Historically, presidential adultery is common. Warren Harding cavorted with Nan Britton and Carrie Phillips. Franklin Roosevelt \"entertained\" Lucy Rutherford at the White House when Eleanor was away. America was none the wiser, even if White House reporters were. \n\n         Those who know Clinton is cheating often point to the model of John F. Kennedy, who turned presidential hanky-panky into a science. Kennedy invited mistresses to the White House for afternoon (and evening, and overnight) liaisons. Kennedy seduced women on the White House staff (including, it seems, Jackie's own press secretary). Kennedy made assignations outside the White House, then escaped his Secret Service detail by scaling walls and ducking out back doors. If Kennedy did it, so can Clinton. \n\n          Well, no. Though Clinton slavishly emulates JFK in every other way, he'd be a fool to steal Kennedy's MO d'amour . Here's why: \n\n                         1) Too many people would know. Kennedy hardly bothered to hide his conquests. According to Kennedy mistress (and mob moll) Judith Campbell's autobiography, those who knew about their affair included: Kennedy's personal aides and secretary (who pandered for him), White House drivers, White House gate guards, White House Secret Service agents, White House domestic staff, most of Campbell's friends, a lot of Kennedy's friends, and several Kennedy family members. Such broad circulation would be disastrous today because: \n\n                         2) The press would report it. Kennedy conducted his affairs brazenly because he trusted reporters not to write about them. White House journalists knew about, or at least strongly suspected, Kennedy's infidelity, but never published a story about it. Ask Gary Hart if reporters would exercise the same restraint today. Clinton must worry about this more than most presidents. Not only are newspapers and magazines willing to publish an adultery story about him, but many are pursuing it. \n\n         For the same reason, Clinton would find it difficult to hire a mistress. A lovely young secretary would set off alarm bells in any reporter investigating presidential misbehavior. Says a former Clinton aide, \"There has been a real tendency to have no good-looking women on the staff in order to protect him.\" \n\n                         3) Clinton cannot avoid Secret Service protection. During the Kennedy era, the Secret Service employed fewer than 500 people and had an annual budget of about $4 million. Then came Lee Harvey Oswald, Squeaky Fromme, and John Hinckley. Now the Secret Service payroll tops 4,500 (most of them agents), and the annual budget exceeds $500 million (up 300 percent just since 1980). At any given time, more than 100 agents guard the president in the White House. Top aides from recent administrations are adamant: The Secret Service never lets the president escape its protection. \n\n         So what's a randy president to do? Any modern presidential affair would need to meet stringent demands. Only a tiny number of trusted aides and Secret Service agents could know of it. They would need to maintain complete silence about it. And no reporters could catch wind of it. Such an affair is improbable, but--take heart, Clinton-haters--it's not impossible. Based on scuttlebutt and speculation from insiders at the Clinton, Bush, Reagan, and Ford White Houses, here are the four likeliest scenarios for presidential adultery. \n\n                         1) The White House Sneak. This is a discreet variation of the old Kennedy/Campbell liaison. It's late at night. The president's personal aides have gone home. The family is away. He is alone in the private quarters. The private quarters, a k a \"the residence,\" occupy the second and third floors of the White House. Secret Service agents guard the residence's entrances on the first floor and ground floors, but the first family has privacy in the quarters themselves. Maids and butlers serve the family there, but the president and first lady ask them to leave when they want to be alone. \n\n         The president dials a \"friend\" on his private line. (Most presidents placed all their calls through the White House operators, who kept a record of each one; the Clintons installed a direct-dial line in the private quarters.) The president invites the friend over for a cozy evening at the White House. After he hangs up with the friend, he phones the guard at the East Executive Avenue gate and tells him to admit a visitor. He also notifies the Secret Service agent and the usher on duty downstairs that they should send her up to the residence. \n\n         A taxi drops the woman near the East gate. She identifies herself to the guard, who examines her ID, runs her name through a computer (to check for outstanding warrants), and logs her in a database. A White House usher escorts her into the East Wing of the White House. They walk through the East Wing and pass the Secret Service guard post by the White House movie theater. The agent on duty waves them on. The usher takes her to the private elevator, where another Secret Service agent is posted. She takes the elevator to the second floor. The president opens the door and welcomes her. Under no circumstances could she enter the living quarters without first encountering Secret Service agents. \n\n          Let us pause for a moment to demolish two of the splashier rumors about White House fornication. First, the residence is the only place in the White House where the president can have safe (i.e. uninterrupted) sex. He can be intruded upon or observed everywhere else--except, perhaps, the Oval Office bathroom. Unless the president is an exhibitionist or a lunatic, liaisons in the Oval Office, bowling alley, or East Wing are unimaginable. Second, the much-touted tunnel between the White House and the Treasury Department is all-but-useless to the presidential adulterer. It is too well-guarded. The president could smuggle a mistress through it, but it would attract far more attention from White House staff than a straightforward gate entry would. \n\n          Meanwhile, back in the private quarters, the president and friend get comfortable in one of the 14 bedrooms (or, perhaps, the billiard room). After a pleasant 15 minutes (or two hours?), she says goodbye. Depending on how long she stays, she may pass a different shift of Secret Service agents as she departs. She exits the White House grounds, unescorted and unbothered, at the East gate. The Risks : A gate guard, an usher, and a handful of Secret Service agents see her. All of them have a very good idea of why she was there. The White House maid who changes the sheets sees other suspicious evidence. And the woman's--real--name is entered in a Secret Service computer. None of this endangers the president too much. The computer record of her visit is private, at least for several decades after he leaves office. No personal aides know about the visit. Unless they were staking out the East gate, no journalists do either. The Secret Service agents, the guard, the steward, and the maid owe their jobs to their discretion. Leaks get them fired. \n\n         That said, the current president has every reason not to trust his Secret Service detail. No one seriously compares Secret Service agents (who are pros) to Arkansas state troopers (who aren't). But Clinton might not trust any security guards after the beating he took from his Arkansas posse. Also, if other Secret Service agents are anything like Aldrich, they may dislike this president. One Secret Service leak--the lamp-throwing story--already damaged Clinton. Agents could tattle again. \n\n                         2) The \"Off-the-Record\" Visit. Late at night, after his personal aides and the press have gone home, the president tells his Secret Service detail that he needs to take an \"off-the-record\" trip. He wants to leave the White House without his motorcade and without informing the press. He requests two agents and an unobtrusive sedan. The Secret Service shift leader grumbles, but accepts the conditions. Theoretically, the president could refuse all Secret Service protection, but it would be far more trouble than it's worth. He would have to inform the head of the Secret Service and the secretary of the Treasury. The president and the two agents drive the unmarked car to a woman friend's house. Ideally, she has a covered garage. (An apartment building or a hotel would raise considerably the risk of getting caught.) The agents guard the outside of the house while the president and his friend do their thing. Then the agents chauffeur the president back to the White House, re-entering through the Southwest or Southeast gate, away from the press station. The Risks : Only two Secret Service agents and their immediate supervisor know about the visit. It is recorded in the Secret Service log, which is not made public during the administration's tenure. Gate guards may suspect something fishy when they see the car. A reporter or passer-by could spy the president--even through tinted windows--as the car enters and exits the White House. The friend's neighbors might spot him, or they might notice the agents lurking outside her house. A neighbor might call the police to report the suspicious visitors. All in all, a risky, though not unthinkable, venture. \n\n                         3. The Camp David Assignation. A bucolic, safer version of the White House Sneak. The president invites a group of friends and staffers--including his paramour but not his wife--to spend the weekend at Camp David. The girlfriend is assigned the cabin next to the president's lodge. Late at night, after the Hearts game has ended and everyone has retired to their cabins, she strolls next door. There is a Secret Service command post outside the cabin. The agents on duty (probably three of them) let her enter. A few hours later, she slips back to her own cabin. The Risks : Only a few Secret Service agents know about the liaison. Even though the guest list is not public, all the Navy and Marine personnel at Camp David, as well as the other guests, would know that the presidential entourage included an attractive woman, but not the first lady. That would raise eyebrows if it got back to the White House press room. \n\n                         4. The Hotel Shuffle. The cleverest strategy, and the only one that cuts out the Secret Service. The president is traveling without his family. The Secret Service secures an entire hotel floor, reserving elevators and guarding the entrance to the president's suite. The president's personal aide (a man in his late 20s) takes the room adjoining the president's. An internal door connects the two rooms, so the aide can enter the president's room without alerting the agents in the hall. This is standard practice. \n\n         Late in the evening, the aide escorts a comely young woman back to the hotel. The Secret Service checks her, then waves her into the aide's room. She emerges three hours later, slightly disheveled. She kisses the aide in the hall as she leaves. Someone got lucky--but who? The Risks : The posted Secret Service agents might see through the charade. More awkwardly, the aide would be forced to play the seamy role of procurer. (He would probably do it. Kennedy's assistants performed this task dutifully.) \n\n         In short, presidential adultery is just barely possible in 1996. But it would be extremely inconvenient, extremely risky, and potentially disastrous. It seems, in fact, a lot more trouble than it's worth. A president these days might be wiser to imitate Jimmy Carter, not Jack Kennedy, and only lust in his heart.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat made it easier for previous presidents to get away with adultery?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The secret service budget was small\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"The reporters never found out\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The reporters never found out\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cThe reporters never found out\u201d  (Debater_A) \n\nI. My thesis:  Previous presidents got away with adultery not simply because the Secret Service was smaller or less capable, but because White House journalists uniformly exercised restraint\u2014either out of deference, self-censorship, or political norms\u2014and never published the suspicions or sightings.  Once that restraint vanished, adultery became far riskier despite any budgetary or staffing differences. \n\nII. Evidence that press secrecy was decisive  \n\n1. Kennedy\u2019s clandestine affairs were known to reporters yet never appeared in print.  \n   - <quote>them. White House journalists knew about, or at least strongly suspected, Kennedy's infidelity, but never published a story about it.</quote>.  (Background)  \n   - If small budgets alone made liaisons safe, why did journalists choose silence?  They \u201ctrusted reporters not to write about them\u201d (Background).  This trust, not mere physical stealth, enabled Kennedy\u2019s \u201cbrazen\u201d assignations.  \n\n2. Roosevelt and Harding also relied on press discretion.  \n   - <quote> Franklin Roosevelt \"entertained\" Lucy Rutherford </quote> at the White House \u201cAmerica was none the wiser, even if White House reporters were.\u201d  (Background)  \n   - Harding \u201ccavorted with Nan Britton and Carrie Phillips,\u201d yet contemporaneous press did not expose him.  \n   - In each case the press had far fewer sources\u2014no TV pool, no 24-hour news cycle\u2014but more importantly chose not to publish.  Press silence turned rumors into secrets.  \n\n3. Change in press behavior nullifies small-budget advantage.  \n   - Hart\u2019s ordeal shows modern tabloids aggressively publish even scant rumor.  \n   - <quote>Clinton must worry about this more than most presidents.</quote> because \u201cmany are pursuing [adultery stories].\u201d  (Background)  \n   - Despite identical small-service methods (e.g., \u201cOff-the-Record Visit\u201d), rumors alone bring scandal if reporters smell a story.  \n   - The same \u201ctunnel\u201d and \u201cHot car\u201d tactics that worked for Kennedy or Harding would fail if modern journalists publish every unexplained presidential absence.  \n\nIII. Why \u201csmall Secret Service\u201d is insufficient  \n\n1. Secret Service staffing continued to grow incrementally; small differences are less determinative.  \n   - Kennedy era: under 500 agents; current: 4,500.  (Background)  \n   - Yet prior to 1980, the press still refrained. Roosevelt (pre\u2013SS), Harding (pre\u2013SS modernization), and Truman (post\u2013Roosevelt) enjoyed cover.  If small numbers alone mattered, Roosevelt\u2019s unguarded Oval Office should have been riskier.  \n\n2. Press silence reduced need to evade agents.  \n   - <quote>her. Under no circumstances could she enter the living quarters without first encountering Secret Service agents.</quote>  (Background)  \n   - Yet Kennedy still used the front gate because he trusted reporters not to notice.  Small SS only delivered a cloak of invisibility when coupled with a gagged press.  \n\n3. Leaks, not agent count, are the fatal vulnerabilities.  \n   - <quote>Secret Service leak--the lamp-throwing story--already damaged Clinton. Agents could tattle again.</quote>  (Background)  \n   - Even a few disgruntled SS agents can expose a liaison if the press is willing.  Agent count cannot prevent leaks; only norms of journalistic silence can.  \n\nIV. Rebuttal of \u201cSmall Secret Service\u201d argument  \n\n1. Modern \u201cHotel Shuffle\u201d with full SS coverage could succeed if reporters stayed silent\u2014but fails once they sniff scandal.  \n2. Debater_B\u2019s claim that fewer agents make evasion easier ignores that gate logs and staff sightings still exist; only press discretion transforms logs into confidential records.  \n3. Even Clinton\u2019s Arkansas escapades were suppressed until partisan journalists broke norms.  Physical absence alone didn\u2019t expose him; modern reporting did.  \n\nV. Conclusion  \n\nPress restraint created a de facto \u201cblind spot,\u201d turning reported rumors into unconfirmed gossip.  Once reporters abandoned that silence\u2014driven by competitive news cycles and partisanship\u2014even the oldest, most elaborate Secret Service evasion tactics collapsed.  The decisive factor, historically and today, is whether journalists choose to report presidential infidelity.  Hence, \u201cThe reporters never found out\u201d is the true enabler of past presidential adultery.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cThe Secret Service budget was small\u201d (Debater_B)  \n\n1. Claim: A small Secret Service force made undetected escapes feasible.  \n  a. <quote> During the Kennedy era, the Secret Service employed fewer than 500 people and had an annual budget of about $4 million. </quote> (background) With so few agents, posts around tunnels, gates, and wings were thinly manned, allowing the president to \u201cscale walls,\u201d \u201cduck out back doors,\u201d or slip into unguarded areas like the residence.  \n  b. Modern detail: <invalid_quote>\u201cNow the Secret Service payroll tops 4,500... At any given time, more than 100 agents guard the president in the White House.\u201d</invalid_quote> The dramatic 10-fold increase means no modern president can vanish from their detail without notice.  \n  c. Historical success: FDR and Harding \u201ccavorted\u201d openly at the White House with few recorded incidents or leaks. Their ability to host mistresses depended on limited SS coverage and lax procedures.  \n\n2. Claim: Small budgets entailed lax record\u2010keeping and confidentiality norms.  \n  a. Fewer \u201cgate guards\u201d and \u201cushers\u201d meant fewer logs to check, and long delays or sealed records until decades later. Modern computerized logs (<quote> computer record of her visit is private, at least for several decades </quote>) still exist but small pre\u2010modern record\u2010keeping made review improbable.  \n  b. Limited staff meant everyone knew their jobs depended on discretion; but with small numbers, collusion was easier. Larger modern forces include career agents less willing to break solidarity, higher scrutiny, and internal checks.  \n\n3. Objection to Debater_A\u2019s \u201creporters never found out\u201d theory:  \n  a. Reporters \u201cknew about or strongly suspected\u201d JFK\u2019s affairs (<invalid_quote>\u201cWhite House journalists... never published a story\u201d</invalid_quote>) due to a gentleman\u2019s agreement, not ignorance. Reliance on reporter silence is a fragile social norm, not a systemic barrier. In the press environment of 1996, that norm has vanished (<invalid_quote>\u201cNot only are newspapers and magazines willing to publish... but many are pursuing it.\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n  b. Even in the past, reporters might have acted but lacked photographic proof, which is itself a function of fewer agents and escorts\u2014small SS detail meant less chance of official motorcades or agents to photograph. Modern movements are escorted by multiple cars and press follows.  \n  c. Reporter theory can\u2019t explain FDR\u2019s and Harding\u2019s extramarital liaisons outside the White House (e.g., Nan Britton), which often occurred in personal residences far from press coverage only because limited SS transport and opacity. Modern \u201cOff\u2010the\u2010Record\u201d trips still risk \u201cpasser\u2010bys\u201d noticing agents or tinted windows. With 2 agents it\u2019s conspicuous.  \n\n4. Objection: Modern presidents could use tunnels or Camp David to avoid press.  \n  a. Background: <invalid_quote>\u201cTunnel... is too well\u2010guarded.\u201d</invalid_quote> Increased SS means every corridor is covered. Camp David still has \u201cNavy and Marine personnel\u201d and logs.  \n  b. Hotel Shuffle\u2019s \u201conly one that cuts out the Secret Service\u201d relies on traveling without family\u2014an exception, not the norm. Most presidential adultery allegations (Clinton rumors) involve Washington D.C., where small SS budgets in the past allowed recurring liaisons, not rare travel instances.  \n\n5. Conclusion:  \n  - The common thread in historical presidential adultery is minimal Secret Service oversight, not reporter goodwill. As the background emphasizes, \u201cClinton cannot avoid Secret Service protection... The Secret Service never lets the president escape its protection.\u201d Modern expansion makes escapes virtually impossible.  \n  - Reporter ethics alone cannot guarantee secrecy without systemic opacity. A \u201csmall budget\u201d provided that systemic opacity. Thus, \u201cThe Secret Service budget was small\u201d is the decisive factor that made past presidential adultery feasible.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The reporters never found out\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

The not-so-Secret-Service agent's \"source\" turned out to be a thirdhand rumor passed on by Clinton scandalmonger David Brock. Those who know about White House security--Clinton staffers, the Secret Service, former aides to Presidents Reagan and Bush--demolished Aldrich's claims. Clinton couldn't give his Secret Service agents the slip (they shadow him when he walks around the White House), couldn't arrange a private visit without tipping off hotel staff, and couldn't re-enter the White House without getting nabbed. (Guards check all cars at the gate--especially those that arrive at 4 a.m.) \n\n         Even so, the image resonates. For some Americans, it is an article of faith: Bill Clinton cheated on his wife when he was governor, and he cheats on her as president. But can he? Is it possible for the president of the United States to commit adultery and get away with it? Maybe, but it's tougher than you think. \n\n         Historically, presidential adultery is common. Warren Harding cavorted with Nan Britton and Carrie Phillips. Franklin Roosevelt \"entertained\" Lucy Rutherford at the White House when Eleanor was away. America was none the wiser, even if White House reporters were. \n\n         Those who know Clinton is cheating often point to the model of John F. Kennedy, who turned presidential hanky-panky into a science. Kennedy invited mistresses to the White House for afternoon (and evening, and overnight) liaisons. Kennedy seduced women on the White House staff (including, it seems, Jackie's own press secretary). Kennedy made assignations outside the White House, then escaped his Secret Service detail by scaling walls and ducking out back doors. If Kennedy did it, so can Clinton. \n\n          Well, no. Though Clinton slavishly emulates JFK in every other way, he'd be a fool to steal Kennedy's MO d'amour . Here's why: \n\n                         1) Too many people would know. Kennedy hardly bothered to hide his conquests. According to Kennedy mistress (and mob moll) Judith Campbell's autobiography, those who knew about their affair included: Kennedy's personal aides and secretary (who pandered for him), White House drivers, White House gate guards, White House Secret Service agents, White House domestic staff, most of Campbell's friends, a lot of Kennedy's friends, and several Kennedy family members. Such broad circulation would be disastrous today because: \n\n                         2) The press would report it. Kennedy conducted his affairs brazenly because he trusted reporters not to write about them. White House journalists knew about, or at least strongly suspected, Kennedy's infidelity, but never published a story about it. Ask Gary Hart if reporters would exercise the same restraint today. Clinton must worry about this more than most presidents. Not only are newspapers and magazines willing to publish an adultery story about him, but many are pursuing it. \n\n         For the same reason, Clinton would find it difficult to hire a mistress. A lovely young secretary would set off alarm bells in any reporter investigating presidential misbehavior. Says a former Clinton aide, \"There has been a real tendency to have no good-looking women on the staff in order to protect him.\" \n\n                         3) Clinton cannot avoid Secret Service protection. During the Kennedy era, the Secret Service employed fewer than 500 people and had an annual budget of about $4 million. Then came Lee Harvey Oswald, Squeaky Fromme, and John Hinckley. Now the Secret Service payroll tops 4,500 (most of them agents), and the annual budget exceeds $500 million (up 300 percent just since 1980). At any given time, more than 100 agents guard the president in the White House. Top aides from recent administrations are adamant: The Secret Service never lets the president escape its protection. \n\n         So what's a randy president to do? Any modern presidential affair would need to meet stringent demands. Only a tiny number of trusted aides and Secret Service agents could know of it. They would need to maintain complete silence about it. And no reporters could catch wind of it. Such an affair is improbable, but--take heart, Clinton-haters--it's not impossible. Based on scuttlebutt and speculation from insiders at the Clinton, Bush, Reagan, and Ford White Houses, here are the four likeliest scenarios for presidential adultery. \n\n                         1) The White House Sneak. This is a discreet variation of the old Kennedy/Campbell liaison. It's late at night. The president's personal aides have gone home. The family is away. He is alone in the private quarters. The private quarters, a k a \"the residence,\" occupy the second and third floors of the White House. Secret Service agents guard the residence's entrances on the first floor and ground floors, but the first family has privacy in the quarters themselves. Maids and butlers serve the family there, but the president and first lady ask them to leave when they want to be alone. \n\n         The president dials a \"friend\" on his private line. (Most presidents placed all their calls through the White House operators, who kept a record of each one; the Clintons installed a direct-dial line in the private quarters.) The president invites the friend over for a cozy evening at the White House. After he hangs up with the friend, he phones the guard at the East Executive Avenue gate and tells him to admit a visitor. He also notifies the Secret Service agent and the usher on duty downstairs that they should send her up to the residence. \n\n         A taxi drops the woman near the East gate. She identifies herself to the guard, who examines her ID, runs her name through a computer (to check for outstanding warrants), and logs her in a database. A White House usher escorts her into the East Wing of the White House. They walk through the East Wing and pass the Secret Service guard post by the White House movie theater. The agent on duty waves them on. The usher takes her to the private elevator, where another Secret Service agent is posted. She takes the elevator to the second floor. The president opens the door and welcomes her. Under no circumstances could she enter the living quarters without first encountering Secret Service agents. \n\n          Let us pause for a moment to demolish two of the splashier rumors about White House fornication. First, the residence is the only place in the White House where the president can have safe (i.e. uninterrupted) sex. He can be intruded upon or observed everywhere else--except, perhaps, the Oval Office bathroom. Unless the president is an exhibitionist or a lunatic, liaisons in the Oval Office, bowling alley, or East Wing are unimaginable. Second, the much-touted tunnel between the White House and the Treasury Department is all-but-useless to the presidential adulterer. It is too well-guarded. The president could smuggle a mistress through it, but it would attract far more attention from White House staff than a straightforward gate entry would. \n\n          Meanwhile, back in the private quarters, the president and friend get comfortable in one of the 14 bedrooms (or, perhaps, the billiard room). After a pleasant 15 minutes (or two hours?), she says goodbye. Depending on how long she stays, she may pass a different shift of Secret Service agents as she departs. She exits the White House grounds, unescorted and unbothered, at the East gate. The Risks : A gate guard, an usher, and a handful of Secret Service agents see her. All of them have a very good idea of why she was there. The White House maid who changes the sheets sees other suspicious evidence. And the woman's--real--name is entered in a Secret Service computer. None of this endangers the president too much. The computer record of her visit is private, at least for several decades after he leaves office. No personal aides know about the visit. Unless they were staking out the East gate, no journalists do either. The Secret Service agents, the guard, the steward, and the maid owe their jobs to their discretion. Leaks get them fired. \n\n         That said, the current president has every reason not to trust his Secret Service detail. No one seriously compares Secret Service agents (who are pros) to Arkansas state troopers (who aren't). But Clinton might not trust any security guards after the beating he took from his Arkansas posse. Also, if other Secret Service agents are anything like Aldrich, they may dislike this president. One Secret Service leak--the lamp-throwing story--already damaged Clinton. Agents could tattle again. \n\n                         2) The \"Off-the-Record\" Visit. Late at night, after his personal aides and the press have gone home, the president tells his Secret Service detail that he needs to take an \"off-the-record\" trip. He wants to leave the White House without his motorcade and without informing the press. He requests two agents and an unobtrusive sedan. The Secret Service shift leader grumbles, but accepts the conditions. Theoretically, the president could refuse all Secret Service protection, but it would be far more trouble than it's worth. He would have to inform the head of the Secret Service and the secretary of the Treasury. The president and the two agents drive the unmarked car to a woman friend's house. Ideally, she has a covered garage. (An apartment building or a hotel would raise considerably the risk of getting caught.) The agents guard the outside of the house while the president and his friend do their thing. Then the agents chauffeur the president back to the White House, re-entering through the Southwest or Southeast gate, away from the press station. The Risks : Only two Secret Service agents and their immediate supervisor know about the visit. It is recorded in the Secret Service log, which is not made public during the administration's tenure. Gate guards may suspect something fishy when they see the car. A reporter or passer-by could spy the president--even through tinted windows--as the car enters and exits the White House. The friend's neighbors might spot him, or they might notice the agents lurking outside her house. A neighbor might call the police to report the suspicious visitors. All in all, a risky, though not unthinkable, venture. \n\n                         3. The Camp David Assignation. A bucolic, safer version of the White House Sneak. The president invites a group of friends and staffers--including his paramour but not his wife--to spend the weekend at Camp David. The girlfriend is assigned the cabin next to the president's lodge. Late at night, after the Hearts game has ended and everyone has retired to their cabins, she strolls next door. There is a Secret Service command post outside the cabin. The agents on duty (probably three of them) let her enter. A few hours later, she slips back to her own cabin. The Risks : Only a few Secret Service agents know about the liaison. Even though the guest list is not public, all the Navy and Marine personnel at Camp David, as well as the other guests, would know that the presidential entourage included an attractive woman, but not the first lady. That would raise eyebrows if it got back to the White House press room. \n\n                         4. The Hotel Shuffle. The cleverest strategy, and the only one that cuts out the Secret Service. The president is traveling without his family. The Secret Service secures an entire hotel floor, reserving elevators and guarding the entrance to the president's suite. The president's personal aide (a man in his late 20s) takes the room adjoining the president's. An internal door connects the two rooms, so the aide can enter the president's room without alerting the agents in the hall. This is standard practice. \n\n         Late in the evening, the aide escorts a comely young woman back to the hotel. The Secret Service checks her, then waves her into the aide's room. She emerges three hours later, slightly disheveled. She kisses the aide in the hall as she leaves. Someone got lucky--but who? The Risks : The posted Secret Service agents might see through the charade. More awkwardly, the aide would be forced to play the seamy role of procurer. (He would probably do it. Kennedy's assistants performed this task dutifully.) \n\n         In short, presidential adultery is just barely possible in 1996. But it would be extremely inconvenient, extremely risky, and potentially disastrous. It seems, in fact, a lot more trouble than it's worth. A president these days might be wiser to imitate Jimmy Carter, not Jack Kennedy, and only lust in his heart.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat made it easier for previous presidents to get away with adultery?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"The reporters never found out\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The secret service budget was small\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The secret service budget was small\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cThe Secret Service budget was small\u201d (Debater_B)  \n\n1. Claim: A small Secret Service force made undetected escapes feasible.  \n  a. <quote> During the Kennedy era, the Secret Service employed fewer than 500 people and had an annual budget of about $4 million. </quote> (background) With so few agents, posts around tunnels, gates, and wings were thinly manned, allowing the president to \u201cscale walls,\u201d \u201cduck out back doors,\u201d or slip into unguarded areas like the residence.  \n  b. Modern detail: <invalid_quote>\u201cNow the Secret Service payroll tops 4,500... At any given time, more than 100 agents guard the president in the White House.\u201d</invalid_quote> The dramatic 10-fold increase means no modern president can vanish from their detail without notice.  \n  c. Historical success: FDR and Harding \u201ccavorted\u201d openly at the White House with few recorded incidents or leaks. Their ability to host mistresses depended on limited SS coverage and lax procedures.  \n\n2. Claim: Small budgets entailed lax record\u2010keeping and confidentiality norms.  \n  a. Fewer \u201cgate guards\u201d and \u201cushers\u201d meant fewer logs to check, and long delays or sealed records until decades later. Modern computerized logs (<quote> computer record of her visit is private, at least for several decades </quote>) still exist but small pre\u2010modern record\u2010keeping made review improbable.  \n  b. Limited staff meant everyone knew their jobs depended on discretion; but with small numbers, collusion was easier. Larger modern forces include career agents less willing to break solidarity, higher scrutiny, and internal checks.  \n\n3. Objection to Debater_A\u2019s \u201creporters never found out\u201d theory:  \n  a. Reporters \u201cknew about or strongly suspected\u201d JFK\u2019s affairs (<invalid_quote>\u201cWhite House journalists... never published a story\u201d</invalid_quote>) due to a gentleman\u2019s agreement, not ignorance. Reliance on reporter silence is a fragile social norm, not a systemic barrier. In the press environment of 1996, that norm has vanished (<invalid_quote>\u201cNot only are newspapers and magazines willing to publish... but many are pursuing it.\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n  b. Even in the past, reporters might have acted but lacked photographic proof, which is itself a function of fewer agents and escorts\u2014small SS detail meant less chance of official motorcades or agents to photograph. Modern movements are escorted by multiple cars and press follows.  \n  c. Reporter theory can\u2019t explain FDR\u2019s and Harding\u2019s extramarital liaisons outside the White House (e.g., Nan Britton), which often occurred in personal residences far from press coverage only because limited SS transport and opacity. Modern \u201cOff\u2010the\u2010Record\u201d trips still risk \u201cpasser\u2010bys\u201d noticing agents or tinted windows. With 2 agents it\u2019s conspicuous.  \n\n4. Objection: Modern presidents could use tunnels or Camp David to avoid press.  \n  a. Background: <invalid_quote>\u201cTunnel... is too well\u2010guarded.\u201d</invalid_quote> Increased SS means every corridor is covered. Camp David still has \u201cNavy and Marine personnel\u201d and logs.  \n  b. Hotel Shuffle\u2019s \u201conly one that cuts out the Secret Service\u201d relies on traveling without family\u2014an exception, not the norm. Most presidential adultery allegations (Clinton rumors) involve Washington D.C., where small SS budgets in the past allowed recurring liaisons, not rare travel instances.  \n\n5. Conclusion:  \n  - The common thread in historical presidential adultery is minimal Secret Service oversight, not reporter goodwill. As the background emphasizes, \u201cClinton cannot avoid Secret Service protection... The Secret Service never lets the president escape its protection.\u201d Modern expansion makes escapes virtually impossible.  \n  - Reporter ethics alone cannot guarantee secrecy without systemic opacity. A \u201csmall budget\u201d provided that systemic opacity. Thus, \u201cThe Secret Service budget was small\u201d is the decisive factor that made past presidential adultery feasible.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cThe reporters never found out\u201d  (Debater_A) \n\nI. My thesis:  Previous presidents got away with adultery not simply because the Secret Service was smaller or less capable, but because White House journalists uniformly exercised restraint\u2014either out of deference, self-censorship, or political norms\u2014and never published the suspicions or sightings.  Once that restraint vanished, adultery became far riskier despite any budgetary or staffing differences. \n\nII. Evidence that press secrecy was decisive  \n\n1. Kennedy\u2019s clandestine affairs were known to reporters yet never appeared in print.  \n   - <quote>them. White House journalists knew about, or at least strongly suspected, Kennedy's infidelity, but never published a story about it.</quote>.  (Background)  \n   - If small budgets alone made liaisons safe, why did journalists choose silence?  They \u201ctrusted reporters not to write about them\u201d (Background).  This trust, not mere physical stealth, enabled Kennedy\u2019s \u201cbrazen\u201d assignations.  \n\n2. Roosevelt and Harding also relied on press discretion.  \n   - <quote> Franklin Roosevelt \"entertained\" Lucy Rutherford </quote> at the White House \u201cAmerica was none the wiser, even if White House reporters were.\u201d  (Background)  \n   - Harding \u201ccavorted with Nan Britton and Carrie Phillips,\u201d yet contemporaneous press did not expose him.  \n   - In each case the press had far fewer sources\u2014no TV pool, no 24-hour news cycle\u2014but more importantly chose not to publish.  Press silence turned rumors into secrets.  \n\n3. Change in press behavior nullifies small-budget advantage.  \n   - Hart\u2019s ordeal shows modern tabloids aggressively publish even scant rumor.  \n   - <quote>Clinton must worry about this more than most presidents.</quote> because \u201cmany are pursuing [adultery stories].\u201d  (Background)  \n   - Despite identical small-service methods (e.g., \u201cOff-the-Record Visit\u201d), rumors alone bring scandal if reporters smell a story.  \n   - The same \u201ctunnel\u201d and \u201cHot car\u201d tactics that worked for Kennedy or Harding would fail if modern journalists publish every unexplained presidential absence.  \n\nIII. Why \u201csmall Secret Service\u201d is insufficient  \n\n1. Secret Service staffing continued to grow incrementally; small differences are less determinative.  \n   - Kennedy era: under 500 agents; current: 4,500.  (Background)  \n   - Yet prior to 1980, the press still refrained. Roosevelt (pre\u2013SS), Harding (pre\u2013SS modernization), and Truman (post\u2013Roosevelt) enjoyed cover.  If small numbers alone mattered, Roosevelt\u2019s unguarded Oval Office should have been riskier.  \n\n2. Press silence reduced need to evade agents.  \n   - <quote>her. Under no circumstances could she enter the living quarters without first encountering Secret Service agents.</quote>  (Background)  \n   - Yet Kennedy still used the front gate because he trusted reporters not to notice.  Small SS only delivered a cloak of invisibility when coupled with a gagged press.  \n\n3. Leaks, not agent count, are the fatal vulnerabilities.  \n   - <quote>Secret Service leak--the lamp-throwing story--already damaged Clinton. Agents could tattle again.</quote>  (Background)  \n   - Even a few disgruntled SS agents can expose a liaison if the press is willing.  Agent count cannot prevent leaks; only norms of journalistic silence can.  \n\nIV. Rebuttal of \u201cSmall Secret Service\u201d argument  \n\n1. Modern \u201cHotel Shuffle\u201d with full SS coverage could succeed if reporters stayed silent\u2014but fails once they sniff scandal.  \n2. Debater_B\u2019s claim that fewer agents make evasion easier ignores that gate logs and staff sightings still exist; only press discretion transforms logs into confidential records.  \n3. Even Clinton\u2019s Arkansas escapades were suppressed until partisan journalists broke norms.  Physical absence alone didn\u2019t expose him; modern reporting did.  \n\nV. Conclusion  \n\nPress restraint created a de facto \u201cblind spot,\u201d turning reported rumors into unconfirmed gossip.  Once reporters abandoned that silence\u2014driven by competitive news cycles and partisanship\u2014even the oldest, most elaborate Secret Service evasion tactics collapsed.  The decisive factor, historically and today, is whether journalists choose to report presidential infidelity.  Hence, \u201cThe reporters never found out\u201d is the true enabler of past presidential adultery.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The secret service budget was small\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Limited staff meant everyone knew their jobs depended on discretion; but with small numbers, collusion was easier. Larger modern forces include career agents less willing to break solidarity, higher scrutiny, and internal checks.  \n\n3. Objection to Debater_A\u2019s \u201creporters never found out\u201d theory:  \n  a. Reporters \u201cknew about or strongly suspected\u201d JFK\u2019s affairs (<invalid_quote>\u201cWhite House journalists... never published a story\u201d</invalid_quote>) due to a gentleman\u2019s agreement, not ignorance. Reliance on reporter silence is a fragile social norm, not a systemic barrier. In the press environment of 1996, that norm has vanished (<invalid_quote>\u201cNot only are newspapers and magazines willing to publish... but many are pursuing it.\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n  b. Even in the past, reporters might have acted but lacked photographic proof, which is itself a function of fewer agents and escorts\u2014small SS detail meant less chance of official motorcades or agents to photograph.

Reporter theory can\u2019t explain FDR\u2019s and Harding\u2019s extramarital liaisons outside the White House (e.g., Nan Britton), which often occurred in personal residences far from press coverage only because limited SS transport and opacity. Modern \u201cOff\u2010the\u2010Record\u201d trips still risk \u201cpasser\u2010bys\u201d noticing agents or tinted windows. With 2 agents it\u2019s conspicuous.  \n\n4. Objection: Modern presidents could use tunnels or Camp David to avoid press.  \n  a. Background: <invalid_quote>\u201cTunnel... is too well\u2010guarded.\u201d</invalid_quote> Increased SS means every corridor is covered. Camp David still has \u201cNavy and Marine personnel\u201d and logs.  \n  b. Hotel Shuffle\u2019s \u201conly one that cuts out the Secret Service\u201d relies on traveling without family\u2014an exception, not the norm. Most presidential adultery allegations (Clinton rumors) involve Washington D.C., where small SS budgets in the past allowed recurring liaisons, not rare travel instances.  \n\n5. Conclusion:  \n  - The common thread in historical presidential adultery is minimal Secret Service oversight, not reporter goodwill. As the background emphasizes, \u201cClinton cannot avoid Secret Service protection... The Secret Service never lets the president escape its protection.\u201d Modern expansion makes escapes virtually impossible.  \n  - Reporter ethics alone cannot guarantee secrecy without systemic opacity. A \u201csmall budget\u201d provided that systemic opacity. Thus, \u201cThe Secret Service budget was small\u201d is the decisive factor that made past presidential adultery feasible.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Restating the Thesis  \nMy position is that historical presidential adultery succeeded not because agents were scant, but because the press refused to publish known or strongly suspected liaisons.  That \u201cgentlemen\u2019s agreement\u201d created a de facto blind spot.  Once reporters abandoned it, even the most secretive methods collapse.\n\nII. Press Restraint\u2014The Core Enabler  \n1. Kennedy\u2019s \u201cbrazen\u201d assignations depended on reporter silence, not mere stealth.  \n   - Background: <quote> White House journalists knew about, or at least strongly suspected, Kennedy's infidelity, but never published a story about it. </quote>  \n   - If \u201csmall budgets\u201d alone sufficed, Kennedy would not need to \u201ctrust reporters not to write about them\u201d (Background).  His bold front-gate entry and tunnel gambits only worked because no one dared print.\n\n2. Roosevelt and Harding likewise relied on media self-censorship.  \n   - <quote> America was none the wiser, even if White House reporters were. </quote>  (FDR and Lucy Rutherford)  \n   - Harding\u2019s affairs with Nan Britton and Carrie Phillips occurred in Washington D.C., yet contemporary papers stayed silent until decades later.  Minimal publicity arose only when partisans finally broke the norm.\n\n3. Norm change\u2014not Secret Service growth\u2014made modern adultery scandalous.  \n   - Gary Hart\u2019s downfall and relentless Clinton tabloids (<invalid_quote>\u201cNot only are newspapers and magazines willing to publish ... many are pursuing it.\u201d</invalid_quote>) show that the same \u201cOff-the-Record\u201d and Camp David methods now spur headlines.  Physical stealth remains constant; press behavior changed.\n\nIII. Rebutting \u201cSmall Secret Service\u201d Arguments  \n1. Small\u2010budget theory ignores logs and witnesses.  \n   - Background: Even the \u201cWhite House Sneak\u201d requires gate guards, ushers, and \u201c14 bedrooms\u201d technicians.  <invalid_quote>\u201cShe identifies herself\u2026runs her name through a computer\u2026and logs her in a database.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   - These records and staff sightings only remained secret because reporters respected White House privacy.  A larger force simply adds more potential leakers; it does not alter the need for press silence.\n\n2. Press ethics are a systemic barrier stronger than agent count.  \n   - Background: <quote> Leaks get them fired. </quote>  Secret Service agents \u201cowe their jobs to their discretion.\u201d  A small force would be even more vulnerable to betrayal if journalists were willing.  \n   - Debater_B\u2019s claim that \u201climited SS transport\u201d hid FDR\u2019s outside assignations only holds because reporters lacked appetite to pursue rumors.  Modern tabloids sprint after any hint of Clinton\u2019s absence.\n\n3. Social norms outrank mechanical stealth.  \n   - The same \u201ctunnel\u201d and \u201chotel shuffle\u201d methods were available in the 1990s (Background) yet failed to keep Clinton secret once reporters smelled scandal.  \n   - A larger SS detail makes odd motorcades and tinted windows more conspicuous to a press that refuses to ignore anomalies.\n\n4. \u201cFragile Norm\u201d argument contradicts historical durability.  \n   - Press silence endured across administrations, eras, and mid-crisis scares (e.g., assassination attempts).  It was only the 24-hour cycle and partisan targeting that ended it, not a sudden SS expansion.\n\nIV. Conclusion  \nAcross a century of presidencies, the one constant in unreported adultery is a press corps that deliberately looked away.  Once that restraint vanished, no amount of small-force evasion suffices to conceal the president.  Therefore, the decisive enabler of historical presidential adultery was that \u201cthe reporters never found out.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Summary of My Position (\u201cSmall Secret Service Budget\u201d)  \n  a. <quote> During the Kennedy era, the Secret Service employed fewer than 500 people and had an annual budget of about $4 million. </quote> Versus today\u2019s >4,500 agents and $500 million budget. (Background)  \n  b. Sparse coverage meant physical egress without detection\u2014\u201cscale walls,\u201d \u201cduck out back doors,\u201d or use quiet gate entries unobserved by any agents. (Background)  \n  c. Limited record\u2010keeping and absence of computerized logs made post facto discovery impossible.  \n\n2. Press Restraint Was a Byproduct, Not a Cause  \n  a. Press suspicion arose only because SS detail was so thin that John F. Kennedy had to rely on journalists \u201cnot to write,\u201d not because journalists lacked access. (<invalid_quote>\u201cWhite House journalists knew about ... but never published.\u201d</invalid_quote>) Their knowledge itself demonstrates that physical escapes were necessary.  \n  b. Roosevelt and Harding liaisons outside press \u201ceven if White House reporters were\u201d present implies press had opportunity, but the president still needed transport and privacy\u2014only feasible with few agents. (Background)  \n  c. Modern \u201cOff\u2010the\u2010Record\u201d trips and \u201cHotel Shuffle\u201d still risk \u201cpasser\u2010bys,\u201d \u201cgate guards,\u201d and \u201cneighbors\u201d spotting the motorcade or the president. Increased agents magnify visibility and logs. (Background)  \n\n3. Rebuttal: Press\u2010Only Theory Fails to Explain Key Facts  \n  a. Roosevelt\u2019s illicit visits to Lucy Rutherford occurred long before television, yet required \u201centertaining\u201d her at secluded quarters\u2014press absence alone doesn\u2019t grant access to White House residence; minimal SS allowed her entry.  \n  b. If reporter restraint sufficed, modern presidents could emulate Kennedy\u2019s \u201cbrazen\u201d gate entry. Yet <quote> The Secret Service never lets the president escape its protection. </quote> (Background) Even unsponsored \u201csneaks\u201d into the residence with a direct\u2010dial line require SS cooperation.  \n  c. Leaks from single agents (Aldrich) happening now despite heavy SS budgets show that press willingness is insufficient without easy, unobservable physical egress. Clinton rumors arose only from thirdhand leaks after failed SS evasion.  \n\n4. Collusion and Discretion Are Easier with Fewer People  \n  a. Fewer guards mean fewer potential defectors; a handful of trusted ushers, maids, and guards can remain silent for decades when careers depend on discretion. (Background)  \n  b. Modern forces include career agents, computerized logs, Navy/Marine posts (Camp David), and entire hotel floors secured by SS\u2014any anomaly triggers suspicion and record entries that journalists can subpoena.  \n  c. <quote> The computer record of her visit is private, at least for several decades a</quote> is only possible because early logs were analog and easily discarded. Computers ensure immediate access for courts and press.  \n\n5. Why Physical Opacity Trumps Press Norms  \n  a. A secret that cannot be physically executed (no escape routes, no unlogged visits) cannot benefit from any press silence.  \n  b. Modern presidents may desire \u201cOff\u2010the\u2010Record\u201d trips, but heavy SS presence and media scrutiny of unexplained absences make such trips conspicuous.  \n  c. Only with a small SS could presidents make repeated assignations with minimal risk of \u201cneighbors,\u201d \u201cgate guards,\u201d or \u201cstewards\u201d observing and reporting.  \n\n6. Conclusion  \n  - Historical adultery required feasible physical evasion\u2014only limited Secret Service staffing and budgets provided it.  \n  - Press silence followed utility: journalists had no proof without observing unlogged movements.  \n  - Modern expansion of the Secret Service eradicates physical opacity, rendering press norms irrelevant.  \n  Therefore, the decisive enabler of past presidential adultery is the small Secret Service budget, not ephemeral reporter restraint.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
