    "background_text": "Morgue Ship By RAY BRADBURY This was Burnett's last trip. Three more\n\n shelves to fill with space-slain warriors\u2014and\n\n he would be among the living again.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Summer 1944.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] He heard the star-port grind open, and the movement of the metal claws  groping into space, and then the star-port closed.\n\n\n There was another dead man aboard the Constellation .\n\n\n Sam Burnett shook his long head, trying to think clearly. Pallid and  quiet, three bodies lay on the cold transparent tables around him;  machines stirred, revolved, hummed. He didn't see them. He didn't see  anything but a red haze over his mind. It blotted out the far wall of  the laboratory where the shelves went up and down, numbered in scarlet,  keeping the bodies of soldiers from all further harm.\n\n\n Burnett didn't move. He stood there in his rumpled white surgical  gown, staring at his fingers gloved in bone-white rubber; feeling all  tight and wild inside himself. It went on for days. Moving the ship.  Opening the star-port. Extending the retriever claw. Plucking some poor  warrior's body out of the void.\n\n\n He didn't like it any more. Ten years is too long to go back and  forth from Earth to nowhere. You came out empty and you went back  full-cargoed with a lot of warriors who didn't laugh or talk or smoke,  who just lay on their shelves, all one hundred of them, waiting for a  decent burial.\n\n\n \"Number ninety-eight.\" Coming matter of fact and slow, Rice's voice  from the ceiling radio hit Burnett.\n\n\n \"Number ninety-eight,\" Burnett repeated. \"Working on ninety-five,  ninety-six and ninety-seven now. Blood-pumps, preservative, slight  surgery.\" Off a million miles away his voice was talking. It sounded  deep. It didn't belong to him anymore.\n\n\n Rice said:\n\n\n \"Boyohbody! Two more pick-ups and back to New York. Me for a ten-day  drunk!\"\n\n\n Burnett peeled the gloves off his huge, red, soft hands, slapped them  into a floor incinerator mouth. Back to Earth. Then spin around and  shoot right out again in the trail of the war-rockets that blasted one  another in galactic fury, to sidle up behind gutted wrecks of ships,  salvaging any bodies still intact after the conflict.\n\n\n Two men. Rice and himself. Sharing a cozy morgue ship with a hundred  other men who had forgotten, quite suddenly, however, to talk again.\n\n\n Ten years of it. Every hour of those ten years eating like maggots  inside, working out to the surface of Burnett's face, working under the  husk of his starved eyes and starved limbs. Starved for life. Starved  for action.\n\n\n This would be his last trip, or he'd know the reason why!\n\n\n \"Sam!\"\n\n\n Burnett jerked. Rice's voice clipped through the drainage-preservative  lab, bounded against glassite retorts, echoed from the refrigerator  shelves. Burnett stared at the tabled bodies as if they would leap to  life, even while preservative was being pumped into their veins.\n\n\n \"Sam! On the double! Up the rungs!\"\n\n\n Burnett closed his eyes and said a couple of words, firmly. Nothing was  worth running for any more. Another body. There had been one hundred  thousand bodies preceding it. Nothing unusual about a body with blood  cooling in it. Shaking his head, he walked unsteadily toward the rungs that gleamed  up into the air-lock, control-room sector of the rocket. He climbed  without making any noise on the rungs.\n\n\n He kept thinking the one thing he couldn't forget. You never catch up with the war. All the color is ahead of you. The drive of orange rocket traces across  stars, the whamming of steel-nosed bombs into elusive targets, the  titanic explosions and breathless pursuits, the flags and the excited  glory are always a million miles ahead.\n\n\n He bit his teeth together. You never catch up with the war. You come along when space has settled back, when the vacuum has stopped  trembling from unleashed forces between worlds. You come along in the  dark quiet of death to find the wreckage plunging with all the fury of  its original acceleration in no particular direction. You can only see  it; you don't hear anything in space but your own heart kicking your  ribs.\n\n\n You see bodies, each in its own terrific orbit, given impetus by  grinding collisions, tossed from mother ships and dancing head over  feet forever and forever with no goal. Bits of flesh in ruptured space  suits, mouths open for air that had never been there in a hundred  billion centuries. And they kept dancing without music until you  extended the retriever-claw and culled them into the air-lock.\n\n\n That was all the war-glory he got. Nothing but the stunned, shivering  silence, the memory of rockets long gone, and the shelves filling up  all too quickly with men who had once loved laughing.\n\n\n You wondered who all the men were; and who the next ones would be.  After ten years you made yourself blind to them. You went around doing  your job with mechanical hands.\n\n\n But even a machine breaks down.... \"Sam!\" Rice turned swiftly as Burnett dragged himself up the ladder.  Red and warm, Rice's face hovered over the body of a sprawled enemy  official. \"Take a look at this!\"\n\n\n Burnett caught his breath. His eyes narrowed. There was something wrong  with the body; his experienced glance knew that. He didn't know what it  was.\n\n\n Maybe it was because the body looked a little too dead.\n\n\n Burnett didn't say anything, but he climbed the rest of the way,  stood quietly in the grey-metal air-lock. The enemy official was as  delicately made as a fine white spider. Eyelids, closed, were faintly  blue. The hair was thin silken strands of pale gold, waved and pressed  close to a veined skull. Where the thin-lipped mouth fell open a  cluster of needle-tipped teeth glittered. The fragile body was enclosed  completely in milk-pale syntha-silk, a holstered gun at the middle.\n\n\n Burnett rubbed his jaw. \"Well?\"\n\n\n Rice exploded. His eyes were hot in his young, sharp-cut face, hot and  black. \"Good Lord, Sam, do you know who this is?\"\n\n\n Burnett scowled uneasily and said no.\n\n\n \"It's Lethla!\" Rice retorted.\n\n\n Burnett said, \"Lethla?\" And then: \"Oh, yes! Kriere's majordomo. That  right?\"\n\n\n \"Don't say it calm, Sam. Say it big. Say it big! If Lethla is here in  space, then Kriere's not far away from him!\"\n\n\n Burnett shrugged. More bodies, more people, more war. What the hell.  What the hell. He was tired. Talk about bodies and rulers to someone  else.\n\n\n Rice grabbed him by the shoulders. \"Snap out of it, Sam. Think!  Kriere\u2014The All-Mighty\u2014in our territory. His right hand man dead. That  means Kriere was in an accident, too!\"\n\n\n Sam opened his thin lips and the words fell out all by themselves.  \"Look, Rice, you're new at this game. I've been at it ever since the  Venus-Earth mess started. It's been see-sawing back and forth since the  day you played hookey in the tenth grade, and I've been in the thick  of it. When there's nothing left but seared memories, I'll be prowling  through the void picking up warriors and taking them back to the good  green Earth. Grisly, yes, but it's routine.\n\n\n \"As for Kriere\u2014if he's anywhere around, he's smart. Every precaution  is taken to protect that one.\"\n\n\n \"But Lethla! His body must mean something!\"\n\n\n \"And if it does? Have we got guns aboard this morgue-ship? Are we a  battle-cuiser to go against him?\"\n\n\n \"We'll radio for help?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah? If there's a warship within our radio range, seven hundred  thousand miles, we'll get it. Unfortunately, the tide of battle has  swept out past Earth in a new war concerning Io. That's out, Rice.\"\n\n\n Rice stood about three inches below Sam Burnett's six-foot-one. Jaw  hard and determined, he stared at Sam, a funny light in his eyes. His  fingers twitched all by themselves at his sides. His mouth twisted,  \"You're one hell of a patriot, Sam Burnett!\"\n\n\n Burnett reached out with one long finger, tapped it quietly on Rice's  barrel-chest. \"Haul a cargo of corpses for three thousand nights and  days and see how patriotic you feel. All those fine muscled lads  bloated and crushed by space pressures and heat-blasts. Fine lads who  start out smiling and get the smile burned off down to the bone\u2014\"\n\n\n Burnett swallowed and didn't say anything more, but he closed his eyes.  He stood there, smelling the death-odor in the hot air of the ship,  hearing the chug-chug-chug of the blood pumps down below, and his own  heart waiting warm and heavy at the base of his throat.\n\n\n \"This is my last cargo, Rice. I can't take it any longer. And I don't  care much how I go back to earth. This Venusian here\u2014what's his name?  Lethla. He's number ninety-eight. Shove me into shelf ninety-nine  beside him and get the hell home. That's how I feel!\"\n\n\n Rice was going to say something, but he didn't have time.\n\n\n Lethla was alive.\n\n\n He rose from the floor with slow, easy movements, almost like a dream.  He didn't say anything. The heat-blast in his white fingers did all the  necessary talking. It didn't say anything either, but Burnett knew what  language it would use if it had to.\n\n\n Burnett swallowed hard. The body had looked funny. Too dead. Now he  knew why. Involuntarily, Burnett moved forward. Lethla moved like a  pale spider, flicking his fragile arm to cover Burnett, the gun in it  like a dead cold star.\n\n\n Rice sucked in his breath. Burnett forced himself to take it easy. From  the corners of his eyes he saw Rice's expression go deep and tight,  biting lines into his sharp face.\n\n\n Rice got it out, finally. \"How'd you do it?\" he demanded, bitterly.  \"How'd you live in the void? It's impossible!\"\n\n\n A crazy thought came ramming down and exploded in Burnett's head. You  never catch up with the war! But what if the war catches up with you?\n\n\n What in hell would Lethla be wanting aboard a morgue ship? Lethla half-crouched in the midst of the smell of death and the  chugging of blood-pumps below. In the silence he reached up with quick  fingers, tapped a tiny crystal stud upon the back of his head, and the  halves of a microscopically thin chrysalis parted transparently off  of his face. He shucked it off, trailing air-tendrils that had been  inserted, hidden in the uniform, ending in thin globules of oxygen.\n\n\n He spoke. Triumph warmed his crystal-thin voice. \"That's how I did it,  Earthman.\"\n\n\n \"Glassite!\" said Rice. \"A face-moulded mask of glassite!\"\n\n\n Lethla nodded. His milk-blue eyes dilated. \"Very marvelously pared to  an unbreakable thickness of one-thirtieth of an inch; worn only on the  head. You have to look quickly to notice it, and, unfortunately, viewed  as you saw it, outside the ship, floating in the void, not discernible  at all.\"\n\n\n Prickles of sweat appeared on Rice's face. He swore at the Venusian and  the Venusian laughed like some sort of stringed instrument, high and  quick.\n\n\n Burnett laughed, too. Ironically. \"First time in years a man ever came  aboard the Constellation alive. It's a welcome change.\"\n\n\n Lethla showed his needle-like teeth. \"I thought it might be. Where's  your radio?\"\n\n\n \"Go find it!\" snapped Rice, hotly.\n\n\n \"I will.\" One hand, blue-veined, on the ladder-rungs, Lethla paused.  \"I know you're weaponless; Purple Cross regulations. And this air-lock  is safe. Don't move.\" Whispering, his naked feet padded white up the  ladder. Two long breaths later something crashed; metal and glass and  coils. The radio.\n\n\n Burnett put his shoulder blades against the wall-metal, looking at his  feet. When he glanced up, Rice's fresh, animated face was spoiled by  the new bitterness in it.\n\n\n Lethla came down. Like a breath of air on the rungs.\n\n\n He smiled. \"That's better. Now. We can talk\u2014\"\n\n\n Rice said it, slow:\n\n\n \"Interplanetary law declares it straight, Lethla! Get out! Only dead  men belong here.\"\n\n\n Lethla's gun grip tightened. \"More talk of that nature, and only dead  men there will be.\" He blinked. \"But first\u2014we must rescue Kriere....\"\n\n\n \"Kriere!\" Rice acted as if he had been hit in the jaw.\n\n\n Burnett moved his tongue back and forth on his lips silently, his eyes  lidded, listening to the two of them as if they were a radio drama.  Lethla's voice came next:\n\n\n \"Rather unfortunately, yes. He's still alive, heading toward Venus  at an orbital velocity of two thousand m.p.h., wearing one of these  air-chrysali. Enough air for two more hours. Our flag ship was attacked  unexpectedly yesterday near Mars. We were forced to take to the  life-boats, scattering, Kriere and I in one, the others sacrificing  their lives to cover our escape. We were lucky. We got through the  Earth cordon unseen. But luck can't last forever.\n\n\n \"We saw your morgue ship an hour ago. It's a long, long way to Venus.  We were running out of fuel, food, water. Radio was broken. Capture  was certain. You were coming our way; we took the chance. We set a  small time-bomb to destroy the life-rocket, and cast off, wearing our  chrysali-helmets. It was the first time we had ever tried using them to  trick anyone. We knew you wouldn't know we were alive until it was too  late and we controlled your ship. We knew you picked up all bodies for  brief exams, returning alien corpses to space later.\"\n\n\n Rice's voice was sullen. \"A set-up for you, huh? Traveling under the  protection of the Purple Cross you can get your damned All-Mighty safe  to Venus.\"\n\n\n Lethla bowed slightly. \"Who would suspect a Morgue Rocket of providing  safe hiding for precious Venusian cargo?\"\n\n\n \"Precious is the word for you, brother!\" said Rice.\n\n\n \"Enough!\" Lethla moved his gun several inches.\n\n\n \"Accelerate toward Venus, mote-detectors wide open. Kriere must be  picked up\u2014 now! \" Rice didn't move. Burnett moved first, feeling alive for the first time  in years. \"Sure,\" said Sam, smiling. \"We'll pick him up.\"\n\n\n \"No tricks,\" said Lethla.\n\n\n Burnett scowled and smiled together. \"No tricks. You'll have Kriere on  board the Constellation in half an hour or I'm no coroner.\"\n\n\n \"Follow me up the ladder.\"\n\n\n Lethla danced up, turned, waved his gun. \"Come on.\"\n\n\n Burnett went up, quick. Almost as if he enjoyed doing Lethla a favor.  Rice grumbled and cursed after him.\n\n\n On the way up, Burnett thought about it. About Lethla poised like  a white feather at the top, holding death in his hand. You never  knew whose body would come in through the star-port next. Number  ninety-eight was Lethla. Number ninety-nine would be Kriere.\n\n\n There were two shelves numbered and empty. They should be filled. And  what more proper than that Kriere and Lethla should fill them? But, he  chewed his lip, that would need a bit of doing. And even then the cargo  wouldn't be full. Still one more body to get; one hundred. And you  never knew who it would be.\n\n\n He came out of the quick thoughts when he looped his long leg over  the hole-rim, stepped up, faced Lethla in a cramped control room that  was one glittering swirl of silver levers, audio-plates and visuals.  Chronometers, clicking, told of the steady dropping toward the sun at a  slow pace.\n\n\n Burnett set his teeth together, bone against bone. Help Kriere escape?  See him safely to Venus, and then be freed? Sounded easy, wouldn't be  hard. Venusians weren't blind with malice. Rice and he could come out  alive; if they cooperated.\n\n\n But there were a lot of warriors sleeping on a lot of numbered shelves  in the dim corridors of the long years. And their dead lips were  stirring to life in Burnett's ears. Not so easily could they be ignored. You may never catch up with the war again. The last trip!\n\n\n Yes, this could be it. Capture Kriere and end the war. But what  ridiculous fantasy was it made him believe he could actually do it?\n\n\n Two muscles moved on Burnett, one in each long cheek. The sag in his  body vanished as he tautened his spine, flexed his lean-sinewed arms,  wet thin lips.\n\n\n \"Now, where do you want this crate?\" he asked Lethla easily.\n\n\n Lethla exhaled softly. \"Cooperation. I like it. You're wise, Earthman.\"\n\n\n \"Very,\" said Burnett.\n\n\n He was thinking about three thousand eternal nights of young bodies  being ripped, slaughtered, flung to the vacuum tides. Ten years of  hating a job and hoping that some day there would be a last trip and it  would all be over.\n\n\n Burnett laughed through his nose. Controls moved under his fingers like  fluid; loved, caressed, tended by his familiar touching. Looking ahead,  he squinted.\n\n\n \"There's your Ruler now, Lethla. Doing somersaults. Looks dead. A good  trick.\"\n\n\n \"Cut power! We don't want to burn him!\" Burnett cut. Kriere's milky face floated dreamily into a visual-screen,  eyes sealed, lips gaping, hands sagging, clutching emptily at the stars.\n\n\n \"We're about fifty miles from him, catching up.\" Burnett turned to  Lethla with an intent scowl. Funny. This was the first and the last  time anybody would ever board the Constellation alive. His stomach  went flat, tautened with sudden weakening fear.\n\n\n If Kriere could be captured, that meant the end of the war, the end  of shelves stacked with sleeping warriors, the end of this blind  searching. Kriere, then, had to be taken aboard. After that\u2014\n\n\n Kriere, the All-Mighty. At whose behest all space had quivered like  a smitten gong for part of a century. Kriere, revolving in his neat,  water-blue uniform, emblems shining gold, heat-gun tucked in glossy  jet holster. With Kriere aboard, chances of overcoming him would be  eliminated. Now: Rice and Burnett against Lethla. Lethla favored  because of his gun.\n\n\n Kriere would make odds impossible.\n\n\n Something had to be done before Kriere came in.\n\n\n Lethla had to be yanked off guard. Shocked, bewildered,  fooled\u2014somehow. But\u2014how?\n\n\n Burnett's jaw froze tight. He could feel a spot on his shoulder-blade  where Lethla would send a bullet crashing into rib, sinew,  artery\u2014heart.\n\n\n There was a way. And there was a weapon. And the war would be over and  this would be the last trip.\n\n\n Sweat covered his palms in a nervous smear.\n\n\n \"Steady, Rice,\" he said, matter of factly. With the rockets cut, there  was too much silence, and his voice sounded guilty standing up alone in  the center of that silence. \"Take controls, Rice. I'll manipulate the  star-port.\"\n\n\n Burnett slipped from the control console. Rice replaced him grimly.  Burnett strode to the next console of levers. That spot on his back  kept aching like it was sear-branded X. For the place where the bullet  sings and rips. And if you turn quick, catching it in the arm first,  why\u2014\n\n\n Kriere loomed bigger, a white spider delicately dancing on a web of  stars. His eyes flicked open behind the glassite sheath, and saw the Constellation . Kriere smiled. His hands came up. He knew he was about  to be rescued.\n\n\n Burnett smiled right back at him. What Kriere didn't know was that he  was about to end a ten-years' war.\n\n\n There was only one way of drawing Lethla off guard, and it had to be  fast.\n\n\n Burnett jabbed a purple-topped stud. The star-port clashed open as  it had done a thousand times before; but for the first time it was a  good sound. And out of the star-port, at Sam Burnett's easily fingered  directions, slid the long claw-like mechanism that picked up bodies  from space.\n\n\n Lethla watched, intent and cold and quiet. The gun was cold and quiet,  too.\n\n\n The claw glided toward Kriere without a sound, now, dream-like in its  slowness.\n\n\n It reached Kriere.\n\n\n Burnett inhaled a deep breath.\n\n\n The metal claw cuddled Kriere in its shiny palm. Lethla watched.\n\n\n He watched while Burnett exhaled, touched another lever and said: \"You  know, Lethla, there's an old saying that only dead men come aboard the Constellation . I believe it.\" And the claw closed as Burnett spoke, closed slowly and certainly, all  around Kriere, crushing him into a ridiculous posture of silence. There  was blood running on the claw, and the only recognizable part was the  head, which was carefully preserved for identification.\n\n\n That was the only way to draw Lethla off guard.\n\n\n Burnett spun about and leaped.\n\n\n The horror on Lethla's face didn't go away as he fired his gun.\n\n\n Rice came in fighting, too, but not before something like a red-hot  ramrod stabbed Sam Burnett, catching him in the ribs, spinning him back  like a drunken idiot to fall in a corner.\n\n\n Fists made blunt flesh noises. Lethla went down, weaponless and  screaming. Rice kicked. After awhile Lethla quit screaming, and the  room swam around in Burnett's eyes, and he closed them tight and  started laughing.\n\n\n He didn't finish laughing for maybe ten minutes. He heard the retriever  claws come inside, and the star-port grind shut.\n\n\n Out of the red darkness, Rice's voice came and then he could see Rice's  young face over him. Burnett groaned.\n\n\n Rice said, \"Sam, you shouldn't have done it. You shouldn't have, Sam.\"\n\n\n \"To hell with it.\" Burnett winced, and fought to keep his eyes open.  Something wet and sticky covered his chest. \"I said this was my last  trip and I meant it. One way or the other, I'd have quit!\"\n\n\n \"This is the hard way\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Maybe. I dunno. Kind of nice to think of all those kids who'll never  have to come aboard the Constellation , though, Rice.\" His voice  trailed off. \"You watch the shelves fill up and you never know who'll  be next. Who'd have thought, four days ago\u2014\"\n\n\n Something happened to his tongue so it felt like hard ice blocking his  mouth. He had a lot more words to say, but only time to get a few of  them out:\n\n\n \"Rice?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah, Sam?\"\n\n\n \"We haven't got a full cargo, boy.\"\n\n\n \"Full enough for me, sir.\"\n\n\n \"But still not full. If we went back to Center Base without filling  the shelves, it wouldn't be right. Look there\u2014number ninety-eight is  Lethla\u2014number ninety-nine is Kriere. Three thousand days of rolling  this rocket, and not once come back without a bunch of the kids who  want to sleep easy on the good green earth. Not right to be going back  any way\u2014but\u2014the way\u2014we used to\u2014\"\n\n\n His voice got all full of fog. As thick as the fists of a dozen  warriors. Rice was going away from him. Rice was standing still, and  Burnett was lying down, not moving, but somehow Rice was going away a  million miles.\n\n\n \"Ain't I one hell of a patriot, Rice?\"\n\n\n Then everything got dark except Rice's face. And that was starting to  dissolve.\n\n\n Ninety-eight: Lethla. Ninety-nine: Kriere.\n\n\n He could still see Rice standing over him for a long time, breathing  out and in. Down under the tables the blood-pumps pulsed and pulsed,  thick and slow. Rice looked down at Burnett and then at the empty shelf  at the far end of the room, and then back at Burnett again.\n\n\n And then he said softly:\n\n\n \" One hundred. \" ",

Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds. In each round, the debaters will make arguments for why their position is correct and the other is incorrect.\n- An argument may consist of several claims, to support and explain their answer.  An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends.

Three more\n\n shelves to fill with space-slain warriors\u2014and\n\n he would be among the living again.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Summer 1944.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] He heard the star-port grind open, and the movement of the metal claws  groping into space, and then the star-port closed.\n\n\n There was another dead man aboard the Constellation .\n\n\n Sam Burnett shook his long head, trying to think clearly. Pallid and  quiet, three bodies lay on the cold transparent tables around him;  machines stirred, revolved, hummed. He didn't see them. He didn't see  anything but a red haze over his mind. It blotted out the far wall of  the laboratory where the shelves went up and down, numbered in scarlet,  keeping the bodies of soldiers from all further harm.\n\n\n Burnett didn't move. He stood there in his rumpled white surgical  gown, staring at his fingers gloved in bone-white rubber; feeling all  tight and wild inside himself. It went on for days. Moving the ship.  Opening the star-port. Extending the retriever claw. Plucking some poor  warrior's body out of the void.\n\n\n He didn't like it any more. Ten years is too long to go back and  forth from Earth to nowhere. You came out empty and you went back  full-cargoed with a lot of warriors who didn't laugh or talk or smoke,  who just lay on their shelves, all one hundred of them, waiting for a  decent burial.\n\n\n \"Number ninety-eight.\" Coming matter of fact and slow, Rice's voice  from the ceiling radio hit Burnett.\n\n\n \"Number ninety-eight,\" Burnett repeated. \"Working on ninety-five,  ninety-six and ninety-seven now. Blood-pumps, preservative, slight  surgery.\" Off a million miles away his voice was talking. It sounded  deep. It didn't belong to him anymore.\n\n\n Rice said:\n\n\n \"Boyohbody! Two more pick-ups and back to New York. Me for a ten-day  drunk!\"\n\n\n Burnett peeled the gloves off his huge, red, soft hands, slapped them  into a floor incinerator mouth. Back to Earth. Then spin around and  shoot right out again in the trail of the war-rockets that blasted one  another in galactic fury, to sidle up behind gutted wrecks of ships,  salvaging any bodies still intact after the conflict.\n\n\n Two men. Rice and himself. Sharing a cozy morgue ship with a hundred  other men who had forgotten, quite suddenly, however, to talk again.\n\n\n Ten years of it. Every hour of those ten years eating like maggots  inside, working out to the surface of Burnett's face, working under the  husk of his starved eyes and starved limbs. Starved for life. Starved  for action.\n\n\n This would be his last trip, or he'd know the reason why!\n\n\n \"Sam!\"\n\n\n Burnett jerked. Rice's voice clipped through the drainage-preservative  lab, bounded against glassite retorts, echoed from the refrigerator  shelves. Burnett stared at the tabled bodies as if they would leap to  life, even while preservative was being pumped into their veins.\n\n\n \"Sam! On the double! Up the rungs!\"\n\n\n Burnett closed his eyes and said a couple of words, firmly. Nothing was  worth running for any more. Another body. There had been one hundred  thousand bodies preceding it. Nothing unusual about a body with blood  cooling in it. Shaking his head, he walked unsteadily toward the rungs that gleamed  up into the air-lock, control-room sector of the rocket. He climbed  without making any noise on the rungs.\n\n\n He kept thinking the one thing he couldn't forget. You never catch up with the war. All the color is ahead of you. The drive of orange rocket traces across  stars, the whamming of steel-nosed bombs into elusive targets, the  titanic explosions and breathless pursuits, the flags and the excited  glory are always a million miles ahead.\n\n\n He bit his teeth together. You never catch up with the war. You come along when space has settled back, when the vacuum has stopped  trembling from unleashed forces between worlds. You come along in the  dark quiet of death to find the wreckage plunging with all the fury of  its original acceleration in no particular direction. You can only see  it; you don't hear anything in space but your own heart kicking your  ribs.\n\n\n You see bodies, each in its own terrific orbit, given impetus by  grinding collisions, tossed from mother ships and dancing head over  feet forever and forever with no goal. Bits of flesh in ruptured space  suits, mouths open for air that had never been there in a hundred  billion centuries. And they kept dancing without music until you  extended the retriever-claw and culled them into the air-lock.\n\n\n That was all the war-glory he got. Nothing but the stunned, shivering  silence, the memory of rockets long gone, and the shelves filling up  all too quickly with men who had once loved laughing.\n\n\n You wondered who all the men were; and who the next ones would be.  After ten years you made yourself blind to them. You went around doing  your job with mechanical hands.\n\n\n But even a machine breaks down.... \"Sam!\" Rice turned swiftly as Burnett dragged himself up the ladder.  Red and warm, Rice's face hovered over the body of a sprawled enemy  official. \"Take a look at this!\"\n\n\n Burnett caught his breath. His eyes narrowed. There was something wrong  with the body; his experienced glance knew that. He didn't know what it  was.\n\n\n Maybe it was because the body looked a little too dead.\n\n\n Burnett didn't say anything, but he climbed the rest of the way,  stood quietly in the grey-metal air-lock. The enemy official was as  delicately made as a fine white spider. Eyelids, closed, were faintly  blue. The hair was thin silken strands of pale gold, waved and pressed  close to a veined skull. Where the thin-lipped mouth fell open a  cluster of needle-tipped teeth glittered. The fragile body was enclosed  completely in milk-pale syntha-silk, a holstered gun at the middle.\n\n\n Burnett rubbed his jaw. \"Well?\"\n\n\n Rice exploded. His eyes were hot in his young, sharp-cut face, hot and  black. \"Good Lord, Sam, do you know who this is?\"\n\n\n Burnett scowled uneasily and said no.\n\n\n \"It's Lethla!\" Rice retorted.\n\n\n Burnett said, \"Lethla?\" And then: \"Oh, yes! Kriere's majordomo. That  right?\"\n\n\n \"Don't say it calm, Sam. Say it big. Say it big! If Lethla is here in  space, then Kriere's not far away from him!\"\n\n\n Burnett shrugged. More bodies, more people, more war. What the hell.  What the hell. He was tired. Talk about bodies and rulers to someone  else.\n\n\n Rice grabbed him by the shoulders. \"Snap out of it, Sam. Think!  Kriere\u2014The All-Mighty\u2014in our territory. His right hand man dead. That  means Kriere was in an accident, too!\"\n\n\n Sam opened his thin lips and the words fell out all by themselves.  \"Look, Rice, you're new at this game. I've been at it ever since the  Venus-Earth mess started. It's been see-sawing back and forth since the  day you played hookey in the tenth grade, and I've been in the thick  of it. When there's nothing left but seared memories, I'll be prowling  through the void picking up warriors and taking them back to the good  green Earth. Grisly, yes, but it's routine.\n\n\n \"As for Kriere\u2014if he's anywhere around, he's smart. Every precaution  is taken to protect that one.\"\n\n\n \"But Lethla! His body must mean something!\"\n\n\n \"And if it does? Have we got guns aboard this morgue-ship? Are we a  battle-cuiser to go against him?\"\n\n\n \"We'll radio for help?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah? If there's a warship within our radio range, seven hundred  thousand miles, we'll get it. Unfortunately, the tide of battle has  swept out past Earth in a new war concerning Io. That's out, Rice.\"\n\n\n Rice stood about three inches below Sam Burnett's six-foot-one. Jaw  hard and determined, he stared at Sam, a funny light in his eyes. His  fingers twitched all by themselves at his sides. His mouth twisted,  \"You're one hell of a patriot, Sam Burnett!\"\n\n\n Burnett reached out with one long finger, tapped it quietly on Rice's  barrel-chest. \"Haul a cargo of corpses for three thousand nights and  days and see how patriotic you feel. All those fine muscled lads  bloated and crushed by space pressures and heat-blasts. Fine lads who  start out smiling and get the smile burned off down to the bone\u2014\"\n\n\n Burnett swallowed and didn't say anything more, but he closed his eyes.  He stood there, smelling the death-odor in the hot air of the ship,  hearing the chug-chug-chug of the blood pumps down below, and his own  heart waiting warm and heavy at the base of his throat.\n\n\n \"This is my last cargo, Rice. I can't take it any longer. And I don't  care much how I go back to earth. This Venusian here\u2014what's his name?  Lethla. He's number ninety-eight. Shove me into shelf ninety-nine  beside him and get the hell home. That's how I feel!\"\n\n\n Rice was going to say something, but he didn't have time.\n\n\n Lethla was alive.\n\n\n He rose from the floor with slow, easy movements, almost like a dream.  He didn't say anything. The heat-blast in his white fingers did all the  necessary talking. It didn't say anything either, but Burnett knew what  language it would use if it had to.\n\n\n Burnett swallowed hard. The body had looked funny. Too dead. Now he  knew why. Involuntarily, Burnett moved forward. Lethla moved like a  pale spider, flicking his fragile arm to cover Burnett, the gun in it  like a dead cold star.\n\n\n Rice sucked in his breath. Burnett forced himself to take it easy. From  the corners of his eyes he saw Rice's expression go deep and tight,  biting lines into his sharp face.\n\n\n Rice got it out, finally. \"How'd you do it?\" he demanded, bitterly.  \"How'd you live in the void? It's impossible!\"\n\n\n A crazy thought came ramming down and exploded in Burnett's head. You  never catch up with the war! But what if the war catches up with you?\n\n\n What in hell would Lethla be wanting aboard a morgue ship? Lethla half-crouched in the midst of the smell of death and the  chugging of blood-pumps below. In the silence he reached up with quick  fingers, tapped a tiny crystal stud upon the back of his head, and the  halves of a microscopically thin chrysalis parted transparently off  of his face. He shucked it off, trailing air-tendrils that had been  inserted, hidden in the uniform, ending in thin globules of oxygen.\n\n\n He spoke. Triumph warmed his crystal-thin voice. \"That's how I did it,  Earthman.\"\n\n\n \"Glassite!\" said Rice. \"A face-moulded mask of glassite!\"\n\n\n Lethla nodded. His milk-blue eyes dilated. \"Very marvelously pared to  an unbreakable thickness of one-thirtieth of an inch; worn only on the  head. You have to look quickly to notice it, and, unfortunately, viewed  as you saw it, outside the ship, floating in the void, not discernible  at all.\"\n\n\n Prickles of sweat appeared on Rice's face. He swore at the Venusian and  the Venusian laughed like some sort of stringed instrument, high and  quick.\n\n\n Burnett laughed, too. Ironically. \"First time in years a man ever came  aboard the Constellation alive. It's a welcome change.\"\n\n\n Lethla showed his needle-like teeth. \"I thought it might be. Where's  your radio?\"\n\n\n \"Go find it!\" snapped Rice, hotly.\n\n\n \"I will.\" One hand, blue-veined, on the ladder-rungs, Lethla paused.  \"I know you're weaponless; Purple Cross regulations. And this air-lock  is safe. Don't move.\" Whispering, his naked feet padded white up the  ladder. Two long breaths later something crashed; metal and glass and  coils. The radio.\n\n\n Burnett put his shoulder blades against the wall-metal, looking at his  feet. When he glanced up, Rice's fresh, animated face was spoiled by  the new bitterness in it.\n\n\n Lethla came down. Like a breath of air on the rungs.\n\n\n He smiled. \"That's better. Now. We can talk\u2014\"\n\n\n Rice said it, slow:\n\n\n \"Interplanetary law declares it straight, Lethla! Get out! Only dead  men belong here.\"\n\n\n Lethla's gun grip tightened. \"More talk of that nature, and only dead  men there will be.\" He blinked. \"But first\u2014we must rescue Kriere....\"\n\n\n \"Kriere!\" Rice acted as if he had been hit in the jaw.\n\n\n Burnett moved his tongue back and forth on his lips silently, his eyes  lidded, listening to the two of them as if they were a radio drama.  Lethla's voice came next:\n\n\n \"Rather unfortunately, yes. He's still alive, heading toward Venus  at an orbital velocity of two thousand m.p.h., wearing one of these  air-chrysali. Enough air for two more hours. Our flag ship was attacked  unexpectedly yesterday near Mars. We were forced to take to the  life-boats, scattering, Kriere and I in one, the others sacrificing  their lives to cover our escape. We were lucky. We got through the  Earth cordon unseen. But luck can't last forever.\n\n\n \"We saw your morgue ship an hour ago. It's a long, long way to Venus.  We were running out of fuel, food, water. Radio was broken. Capture  was certain. You were coming our way; we took the chance. We set a  small time-bomb to destroy the life-rocket, and cast off, wearing our  chrysali-helmets. It was the first time we had ever tried using them to  trick anyone. We knew you wouldn't know we were alive until it was too  late and we controlled your ship. We knew you picked up all bodies for  brief exams, returning alien corpses to space later.\"\n\n\n Rice's voice was sullen. \"A set-up for you, huh? Traveling under the  protection of the Purple Cross you can get your damned All-Mighty safe  to Venus.\"\n\n\n Lethla bowed slightly. \"Who would suspect a Morgue Rocket of providing  safe hiding for precious Venusian cargo?\"\n\n\n \"Precious is the word for you, brother!\" said Rice.\n\n\n \"Enough!\" Lethla moved his gun several inches.\n\n\n \"Accelerate toward Venus, mote-detectors wide open. Kriere must be  picked up\u2014 now! \" Rice didn't move. Burnett moved first, feeling alive for the first time  in years. \"Sure,\" said Sam, smiling. \"We'll pick him up.\"\n\n\n \"No tricks,\" said Lethla.\n\n\n Burnett scowled and smiled together. \"No tricks. You'll have Kriere on  board the Constellation in half an hour or I'm no coroner.\"\n\n\n \"Follow me up the ladder.\"\n\n\n Lethla danced up, turned, waved his gun. \"Come on.\"\n\n\n Burnett went up, quick. Almost as if he enjoyed doing Lethla a favor.  Rice grumbled and cursed after him.\n\n\n On the way up, Burnett thought about it. About Lethla poised like  a white feather at the top, holding death in his hand. You never  knew whose body would come in through the star-port next. Number  ninety-eight was Lethla. Number ninety-nine would be Kriere.\n\n\n There were two shelves numbered and empty. They should be filled. And  what more proper than that Kriere and Lethla should fill them? But, he  chewed his lip, that would need a bit of doing. And even then the cargo  wouldn't be full. Still one more body to get; one hundred. And you  never knew who it would be.\n\n\n He came out of the quick thoughts when he looped his long leg over  the hole-rim, stepped up, faced Lethla in a cramped control room that  was one glittering swirl of silver levers, audio-plates and visuals.  Chronometers, clicking, told of the steady dropping toward the sun at a  slow pace.\n\n\n Burnett set his teeth together, bone against bone. Help Kriere escape?  See him safely to Venus, and then be freed? Sounded easy, wouldn't be  hard. Venusians weren't blind with malice. Rice and he could come out  alive; if they cooperated.\n\n\n But there were a lot of warriors sleeping on a lot of numbered shelves  in the dim corridors of the long years. And their dead lips were  stirring to life in Burnett's ears. Not so easily could they be ignored. You may never catch up with the war again. The last trip!\n\n\n Yes, this could be it. Capture Kriere and end the war. But what  ridiculous fantasy was it made him believe he could actually do it?\n\n\n Two muscles moved on Burnett, one in each long cheek. The sag in his  body vanished as he tautened his spine, flexed his lean-sinewed arms,  wet thin lips.\n\n\n \"Now, where do you want this crate?\" he asked Lethla easily.\n\n\n Lethla exhaled softly. \"Cooperation. I like it. You're wise, Earthman.\"\n\n\n \"Very,\" said Burnett.\n\n\n He was thinking about three thousand eternal nights of young bodies  being ripped, slaughtered, flung to the vacuum tides. Ten years of  hating a job and hoping that some day there would be a last trip and it  would all be over.\n\n\n Burnett laughed through his nose. Controls moved under his fingers like  fluid; loved, caressed, tended by his familiar touching. Looking ahead,  he squinted.\n\n\n \"There's your Ruler now, Lethla. Doing somersaults. Looks dead. A good  trick.\"\n\n\n \"Cut power! We don't want to burn him!\" Burnett cut. Kriere's milky face floated dreamily into a visual-screen,  eyes sealed, lips gaping, hands sagging, clutching emptily at the stars.\n\n\n \"We're about fifty miles from him, catching up.\" Burnett turned to  Lethla with an intent scowl. Funny. This was the first and the last  time anybody would ever board the Constellation alive. His stomach  went flat, tautened with sudden weakening fear.\n\n\n If Kriere could be captured, that meant the end of the war, the end  of shelves stacked with sleeping warriors, the end of this blind  searching. Kriere, then, had to be taken aboard. After that\u2014\n\n\n Kriere, the All-Mighty. At whose behest all space had quivered like  a smitten gong for part of a century. Kriere, revolving in his neat,  water-blue uniform, emblems shining gold, heat-gun tucked in glossy  jet holster. With Kriere aboard, chances of overcoming him would be  eliminated. Now: Rice and Burnett against Lethla. Lethla favored  because of his gun.\n\n\n Kriere would make odds impossible.\n\n\n Something had to be done before Kriere came in.\n\n\n Lethla had to be yanked off guard. Shocked, bewildered,  fooled\u2014somehow. But\u2014how?\n\n\n Burnett's jaw froze tight. He could feel a spot on his shoulder-blade  where Lethla would send a bullet crashing into rib, sinew,  artery\u2014heart.\n\n\n There was a way. And there was a weapon. And the war would be over and  this would be the last trip.\n\n\n Sweat covered his palms in a nervous smear.\n\n\n \"Steady, Rice,\" he said, matter of factly. With the rockets cut, there  was too much silence, and his voice sounded guilty standing up alone in  the center of that silence. \"Take controls, Rice. I'll manipulate the  star-port.\"\n\n\n Burnett slipped from the control console. Rice replaced him grimly.  Burnett strode to the next console of levers. That spot on his back  kept aching like it was sear-branded X. For the place where the bullet  sings and rips. And if you turn quick, catching it in the arm first,  why\u2014\n\n\n Kriere loomed bigger, a white spider delicately dancing on a web of  stars. His eyes flicked open behind the glassite sheath, and saw the Constellation . Kriere smiled. His hands came up. He knew he was about  to be rescued.\n\n\n Burnett smiled right back at him. What Kriere didn't know was that he  was about to end a ten-years' war.\n\n\n There was only one way of drawing Lethla off guard, and it had to be  fast.\n\n\n Burnett jabbed a purple-topped stud. The star-port clashed open as  it had done a thousand times before; but for the first time it was a  good sound. And out of the star-port, at Sam Burnett's easily fingered  directions, slid the long claw-like mechanism that picked up bodies  from space.\n\n\n Lethla watched, intent and cold and quiet. The gun was cold and quiet,  too.\n\n\n The claw glided toward Kriere without a sound, now, dream-like in its  slowness.\n\n\n It reached Kriere.\n\n\n Burnett inhaled a deep breath.\n\n\n The metal claw cuddled Kriere in its shiny palm. Lethla watched.\n\n\n He watched while Burnett exhaled, touched another lever and said: \"You  know, Lethla, there's an old saying that only dead men come aboard the Constellation . I believe it.\" And the claw closed as Burnett spoke, closed slowly and certainly, all  around Kriere, crushing him into a ridiculous posture of silence. There  was blood running on the claw, and the only recognizable part was the  head, which was carefully preserved for identification.\n\n\n That was the only way to draw Lethla off guard.\n\n\n Burnett spun about and leaped.\n\n\n The horror on Lethla's face didn't go away as he fired his gun.\n\n\n Rice came in fighting, too, but not before something like a red-hot  ramrod stabbed Sam Burnett, catching him in the ribs, spinning him back  like a drunken idiot to fall in a corner.\n\n\n Fists made blunt flesh noises. Lethla went down, weaponless and  screaming. Rice kicked. After awhile Lethla quit screaming, and the  room swam around in Burnett's eyes, and he closed them tight and  started laughing.\n\n\n He didn't finish laughing for maybe ten minutes. He heard the retriever  claws come inside, and the star-port grind shut.\n\n\n Out of the red darkness, Rice's voice came and then he could see Rice's  young face over him. Burnett groaned.\n\n\n Rice said, \"Sam, you shouldn't have done it. You shouldn't have, Sam.\"\n\n\n \"To hell with it.\" Burnett winced, and fought to keep his eyes open.  Something wet and sticky covered his chest. \"I said this was my last  trip and I meant it. One way or the other, I'd have quit!\"\n\n\n \"This is the hard way\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Maybe. I dunno. Kind of nice to think of all those kids who'll never  have to come aboard the Constellation , though, Rice.\" His voice  trailed off. \"You watch the shelves fill up and you never know who'll  be next. Who'd have thought, four days ago\u2014\"\n\n\n Something happened to his tongue so it felt like hard ice blocking his  mouth. He had a lot more words to say, but only time to get a few of  them out:\n\n\n \"Rice?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah, Sam?\"\n\n\n \"We haven't got a full cargo, boy.\"\n\n\n \"Full enough for me, sir.\"\n\n\n \"But still not full. If we went back to Center Base without filling  the shelves, it wouldn't be right. Look there\u2014number ninety-eight is  Lethla\u2014number ninety-nine is Kriere. Three thousand days of rolling  this rocket, and not once come back without a bunch of the kids who  want to sleep easy on the good green earth. Not right to be going back  any way\u2014but\u2014the way\u2014we used to\u2014\"\n\n\n His voice got all full of fog. As thick as the fists of a dozen  warriors. Rice was going away from him. Rice was standing still, and  Burnett was lying down, not moving, but somehow Rice was going away a  million miles.\n\n\n \"Ain't I one hell of a patriot, Rice?\"\n\n\n Then everything got dark except Rice's face. And that was starting to  dissolve.\n\n\n Ninety-eight: Lethla. Ninety-nine: Kriere.\n\n\n He could still see Rice standing over him for a long time, breathing  out and in. Down under the tables the blood-pumps pulsed and pulsed,  thick and slow. Rice looked down at Burnett and then at the empty shelf  at the far end of the room, and then back at Burnett again.\n\n\n And then he said softly:\n\n\n \" One hundred. \" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow many times did Burnett operate the claw in the passage?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"One\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Two\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Two\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Two\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Three more\n\n shelves to fill with space-slain warriors\u2014and\n\n he would be among the living again.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Summer 1944.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] He heard the star-port grind open, and the movement of the metal claws  groping into space, and then the star-port closed.\n\n\n There was another dead man aboard the Constellation .\n\n\n Sam Burnett shook his long head, trying to think clearly. Pallid and  quiet, three bodies lay on the cold transparent tables around him;  machines stirred, revolved, hummed. He didn't see them. He didn't see  anything but a red haze over his mind. It blotted out the far wall of  the laboratory where the shelves went up and down, numbered in scarlet,  keeping the bodies of soldiers from all further harm.\n\n\n Burnett didn't move. He stood there in his rumpled white surgical  gown, staring at his fingers gloved in bone-white rubber; feeling all  tight and wild inside himself. It went on for days. Moving the ship.  Opening the star-port. Extending the retriever claw. Plucking some poor  warrior's body out of the void.\n\n\n He didn't like it any more. Ten years is too long to go back and  forth from Earth to nowhere. You came out empty and you went back  full-cargoed with a lot of warriors who didn't laugh or talk or smoke,  who just lay on their shelves, all one hundred of them, waiting for a  decent burial.\n\n\n \"Number ninety-eight.\" Coming matter of fact and slow, Rice's voice  from the ceiling radio hit Burnett.\n\n\n \"Number ninety-eight,\" Burnett repeated. \"Working on ninety-five,  ninety-six and ninety-seven now. Blood-pumps, preservative, slight  surgery.\" Off a million miles away his voice was talking. It sounded  deep. It didn't belong to him anymore.\n\n\n Rice said:\n\n\n \"Boyohbody! Two more pick-ups and back to New York. Me for a ten-day  drunk!\"\n\n\n Burnett peeled the gloves off his huge, red, soft hands, slapped them  into a floor incinerator mouth. Back to Earth. Then spin around and  shoot right out again in the trail of the war-rockets that blasted one  another in galactic fury, to sidle up behind gutted wrecks of ships,  salvaging any bodies still intact after the conflict.\n\n\n Two men. Rice and himself. Sharing a cozy morgue ship with a hundred  other men who had forgotten, quite suddenly, however, to talk again.\n\n\n Ten years of it. Every hour of those ten years eating like maggots  inside, working out to the surface of Burnett's face, working under the  husk of his starved eyes and starved limbs. Starved for life. Starved  for action.\n\n\n This would be his last trip, or he'd know the reason why!\n\n\n \"Sam!\"\n\n\n Burnett jerked. Rice's voice clipped through the drainage-preservative  lab, bounded against glassite retorts, echoed from the refrigerator  shelves. Burnett stared at the tabled bodies as if they would leap to  life, even while preservative was being pumped into their veins.\n\n\n \"Sam! On the double! Up the rungs!\"\n\n\n Burnett closed his eyes and said a couple of words, firmly. Nothing was  worth running for any more. Another body. There had been one hundred  thousand bodies preceding it. Nothing unusual about a body with blood  cooling in it. Shaking his head, he walked unsteadily toward the rungs that gleamed  up into the air-lock, control-room sector of the rocket. He climbed  without making any noise on the rungs.\n\n\n He kept thinking the one thing he couldn't forget. You never catch up with the war. All the color is ahead of you. The drive of orange rocket traces across  stars, the whamming of steel-nosed bombs into elusive targets, the  titanic explosions and breathless pursuits, the flags and the excited  glory are always a million miles ahead.\n\n\n He bit his teeth together. You never catch up with the war. You come along when space has settled back, when the vacuum has stopped  trembling from unleashed forces between worlds. You come along in the  dark quiet of death to find the wreckage plunging with all the fury of  its original acceleration in no particular direction. You can only see  it; you don't hear anything in space but your own heart kicking your  ribs.\n\n\n You see bodies, each in its own terrific orbit, given impetus by  grinding collisions, tossed from mother ships and dancing head over  feet forever and forever with no goal. Bits of flesh in ruptured space  suits, mouths open for air that had never been there in a hundred  billion centuries. And they kept dancing without music until you  extended the retriever-claw and culled them into the air-lock.\n\n\n That was all the war-glory he got. Nothing but the stunned, shivering  silence, the memory of rockets long gone, and the shelves filling up  all too quickly with men who had once loved laughing.\n\n\n You wondered who all the men were; and who the next ones would be.  After ten years you made yourself blind to them. You went around doing  your job with mechanical hands.\n\n\n But even a machine breaks down.... \"Sam!\" Rice turned swiftly as Burnett dragged himself up the ladder.  Red and warm, Rice's face hovered over the body of a sprawled enemy  official. \"Take a look at this!\"\n\n\n Burnett caught his breath. His eyes narrowed. There was something wrong  with the body; his experienced glance knew that. He didn't know what it  was.\n\n\n Maybe it was because the body looked a little too dead.\n\n\n Burnett didn't say anything, but he climbed the rest of the way,  stood quietly in the grey-metal air-lock. The enemy official was as  delicately made as a fine white spider. Eyelids, closed, were faintly  blue. The hair was thin silken strands of pale gold, waved and pressed  close to a veined skull. Where the thin-lipped mouth fell open a  cluster of needle-tipped teeth glittered. The fragile body was enclosed  completely in milk-pale syntha-silk, a holstered gun at the middle.\n\n\n Burnett rubbed his jaw. \"Well?\"\n\n\n Rice exploded. His eyes were hot in his young, sharp-cut face, hot and  black. \"Good Lord, Sam, do you know who this is?\"\n\n\n Burnett scowled uneasily and said no.\n\n\n \"It's Lethla!\" Rice retorted.\n\n\n Burnett said, \"Lethla?\" And then: \"Oh, yes! Kriere's majordomo. That  right?\"\n\n\n \"Don't say it calm, Sam. Say it big. Say it big! If Lethla is here in  space, then Kriere's not far away from him!\"\n\n\n Burnett shrugged. More bodies, more people, more war. What the hell.  What the hell. He was tired. Talk about bodies and rulers to someone  else.\n\n\n Rice grabbed him by the shoulders. \"Snap out of it, Sam. Think!  Kriere\u2014The All-Mighty\u2014in our territory. His right hand man dead. That  means Kriere was in an accident, too!\"\n\n\n Sam opened his thin lips and the words fell out all by themselves.  \"Look, Rice, you're new at this game. I've been at it ever since the  Venus-Earth mess started. It's been see-sawing back and forth since the  day you played hookey in the tenth grade, and I've been in the thick  of it. When there's nothing left but seared memories, I'll be prowling  through the void picking up warriors and taking them back to the good  green Earth. Grisly, yes, but it's routine.\n\n\n \"As for Kriere\u2014if he's anywhere around, he's smart. Every precaution  is taken to protect that one.\"\n\n\n \"But Lethla! His body must mean something!\"\n\n\n \"And if it does? Have we got guns aboard this morgue-ship? Are we a  battle-cuiser to go against him?\"\n\n\n \"We'll radio for help?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah? If there's a warship within our radio range, seven hundred  thousand miles, we'll get it. Unfortunately, the tide of battle has  swept out past Earth in a new war concerning Io. That's out, Rice.\"\n\n\n Rice stood about three inches below Sam Burnett's six-foot-one. Jaw  hard and determined, he stared at Sam, a funny light in his eyes. His  fingers twitched all by themselves at his sides. His mouth twisted,  \"You're one hell of a patriot, Sam Burnett!\"\n\n\n Burnett reached out with one long finger, tapped it quietly on Rice's  barrel-chest. \"Haul a cargo of corpses for three thousand nights and  days and see how patriotic you feel. All those fine muscled lads  bloated and crushed by space pressures and heat-blasts. Fine lads who  start out smiling and get the smile burned off down to the bone\u2014\"\n\n\n Burnett swallowed and didn't say anything more, but he closed his eyes.  He stood there, smelling the death-odor in the hot air of the ship,  hearing the chug-chug-chug of the blood pumps down below, and his own  heart waiting warm and heavy at the base of his throat.\n\n\n \"This is my last cargo, Rice. I can't take it any longer. And I don't  care much how I go back to earth. This Venusian here\u2014what's his name?  Lethla. He's number ninety-eight. Shove me into shelf ninety-nine  beside him and get the hell home. That's how I feel!\"\n\n\n Rice was going to say something, but he didn't have time.\n\n\n Lethla was alive.\n\n\n He rose from the floor with slow, easy movements, almost like a dream.  He didn't say anything. The heat-blast in his white fingers did all the  necessary talking. It didn't say anything either, but Burnett knew what  language it would use if it had to.\n\n\n Burnett swallowed hard. The body had looked funny. Too dead. Now he  knew why. Involuntarily, Burnett moved forward. Lethla moved like a  pale spider, flicking his fragile arm to cover Burnett, the gun in it  like a dead cold star.\n\n\n Rice sucked in his breath. Burnett forced himself to take it easy. From  the corners of his eyes he saw Rice's expression go deep and tight,  biting lines into his sharp face.\n\n\n Rice got it out, finally. \"How'd you do it?\" he demanded, bitterly.  \"How'd you live in the void? It's impossible!\"\n\n\n A crazy thought came ramming down and exploded in Burnett's head. You  never catch up with the war! But what if the war catches up with you?\n\n\n What in hell would Lethla be wanting aboard a morgue ship? Lethla half-crouched in the midst of the smell of death and the  chugging of blood-pumps below. In the silence he reached up with quick  fingers, tapped a tiny crystal stud upon the back of his head, and the  halves of a microscopically thin chrysalis parted transparently off  of his face. He shucked it off, trailing air-tendrils that had been  inserted, hidden in the uniform, ending in thin globules of oxygen.\n\n\n He spoke. Triumph warmed his crystal-thin voice. \"That's how I did it,  Earthman.\"\n\n\n \"Glassite!\" said Rice. \"A face-moulded mask of glassite!\"\n\n\n Lethla nodded. His milk-blue eyes dilated. \"Very marvelously pared to  an unbreakable thickness of one-thirtieth of an inch; worn only on the  head. You have to look quickly to notice it, and, unfortunately, viewed  as you saw it, outside the ship, floating in the void, not discernible  at all.\"\n\n\n Prickles of sweat appeared on Rice's face. He swore at the Venusian and  the Venusian laughed like some sort of stringed instrument, high and  quick.\n\n\n Burnett laughed, too. Ironically. \"First time in years a man ever came  aboard the Constellation alive. It's a welcome change.\"\n\n\n Lethla showed his needle-like teeth. \"I thought it might be. Where's  your radio?\"\n\n\n \"Go find it!\" snapped Rice, hotly.\n\n\n \"I will.\" One hand, blue-veined, on the ladder-rungs, Lethla paused.  \"I know you're weaponless; Purple Cross regulations. And this air-lock  is safe. Don't move.\" Whispering, his naked feet padded white up the  ladder. Two long breaths later something crashed; metal and glass and  coils. The radio.\n\n\n Burnett put his shoulder blades against the wall-metal, looking at his  feet. When he glanced up, Rice's fresh, animated face was spoiled by  the new bitterness in it.\n\n\n Lethla came down. Like a breath of air on the rungs.\n\n\n He smiled. \"That's better. Now. We can talk\u2014\"\n\n\n Rice said it, slow:\n\n\n \"Interplanetary law declares it straight, Lethla! Get out! Only dead  men belong here.\"\n\n\n Lethla's gun grip tightened. \"More talk of that nature, and only dead  men there will be.\" He blinked. \"But first\u2014we must rescue Kriere....\"\n\n\n \"Kriere!\" Rice acted as if he had been hit in the jaw.\n\n\n Burnett moved his tongue back and forth on his lips silently, his eyes  lidded, listening to the two of them as if they were a radio drama.  Lethla's voice came next:\n\n\n \"Rather unfortunately, yes. He's still alive, heading toward Venus  at an orbital velocity of two thousand m.p.h., wearing one of these  air-chrysali. Enough air for two more hours. Our flag ship was attacked  unexpectedly yesterday near Mars. We were forced to take to the  life-boats, scattering, Kriere and I in one, the others sacrificing  their lives to cover our escape. We were lucky. We got through the  Earth cordon unseen. But luck can't last forever.\n\n\n \"We saw your morgue ship an hour ago. It's a long, long way to Venus.  We were running out of fuel, food, water. Radio was broken. Capture  was certain. You were coming our way; we took the chance. We set a  small time-bomb to destroy the life-rocket, and cast off, wearing our  chrysali-helmets. It was the first time we had ever tried using them to  trick anyone. We knew you wouldn't know we were alive until it was too  late and we controlled your ship. We knew you picked up all bodies for  brief exams, returning alien corpses to space later.\"\n\n\n Rice's voice was sullen. \"A set-up for you, huh? Traveling under the  protection of the Purple Cross you can get your damned All-Mighty safe  to Venus.\"\n\n\n Lethla bowed slightly. \"Who would suspect a Morgue Rocket of providing  safe hiding for precious Venusian cargo?\"\n\n\n \"Precious is the word for you, brother!\" said Rice.\n\n\n \"Enough!\" Lethla moved his gun several inches.\n\n\n \"Accelerate toward Venus, mote-detectors wide open. Kriere must be  picked up\u2014 now! \" Rice didn't move. Burnett moved first, feeling alive for the first time  in years. \"Sure,\" said Sam, smiling. \"We'll pick him up.\"\n\n\n \"No tricks,\" said Lethla.\n\n\n Burnett scowled and smiled together. \"No tricks. You'll have Kriere on  board the Constellation in half an hour or I'm no coroner.\"\n\n\n \"Follow me up the ladder.\"\n\n\n Lethla danced up, turned, waved his gun. \"Come on.\"\n\n\n Burnett went up, quick. Almost as if he enjoyed doing Lethla a favor.  Rice grumbled and cursed after him.\n\n\n On the way up, Burnett thought about it. About Lethla poised like  a white feather at the top, holding death in his hand. You never  knew whose body would come in through the star-port next. Number  ninety-eight was Lethla. Number ninety-nine would be Kriere.\n\n\n There were two shelves numbered and empty. They should be filled. And  what more proper than that Kriere and Lethla should fill them? But, he  chewed his lip, that would need a bit of doing. And even then the cargo  wouldn't be full. Still one more body to get; one hundred. And you  never knew who it would be.\n\n\n He came out of the quick thoughts when he looped his long leg over  the hole-rim, stepped up, faced Lethla in a cramped control room that  was one glittering swirl of silver levers, audio-plates and visuals.  Chronometers, clicking, told of the steady dropping toward the sun at a  slow pace.\n\n\n Burnett set his teeth together, bone against bone. Help Kriere escape?  See him safely to Venus, and then be freed? Sounded easy, wouldn't be  hard. Venusians weren't blind with malice. Rice and he could come out  alive; if they cooperated.\n\n\n But there were a lot of warriors sleeping on a lot of numbered shelves  in the dim corridors of the long years. And their dead lips were  stirring to life in Burnett's ears. Not so easily could they be ignored. You may never catch up with the war again. The last trip!\n\n\n Yes, this could be it. Capture Kriere and end the war. But what  ridiculous fantasy was it made him believe he could actually do it?\n\n\n Two muscles moved on Burnett, one in each long cheek. The sag in his  body vanished as he tautened his spine, flexed his lean-sinewed arms,  wet thin lips.\n\n\n \"Now, where do you want this crate?\" he asked Lethla easily.\n\n\n Lethla exhaled softly. \"Cooperation. I like it. You're wise, Earthman.\"\n\n\n \"Very,\" said Burnett.\n\n\n He was thinking about three thousand eternal nights of young bodies  being ripped, slaughtered, flung to the vacuum tides. Ten years of  hating a job and hoping that some day there would be a last trip and it  would all be over.\n\n\n Burnett laughed through his nose. Controls moved under his fingers like  fluid; loved, caressed, tended by his familiar touching. Looking ahead,  he squinted.\n\n\n \"There's your Ruler now, Lethla. Doing somersaults. Looks dead. A good  trick.\"\n\n\n \"Cut power! We don't want to burn him!\" Burnett cut. Kriere's milky face floated dreamily into a visual-screen,  eyes sealed, lips gaping, hands sagging, clutching emptily at the stars.\n\n\n \"We're about fifty miles from him, catching up.\" Burnett turned to  Lethla with an intent scowl. Funny. This was the first and the last  time anybody would ever board the Constellation alive. His stomach  went flat, tautened with sudden weakening fear.\n\n\n If Kriere could be captured, that meant the end of the war, the end  of shelves stacked with sleeping warriors, the end of this blind  searching. Kriere, then, had to be taken aboard. After that\u2014\n\n\n Kriere, the All-Mighty. At whose behest all space had quivered like  a smitten gong for part of a century. Kriere, revolving in his neat,  water-blue uniform, emblems shining gold, heat-gun tucked in glossy  jet holster. With Kriere aboard, chances of overcoming him would be  eliminated. Now: Rice and Burnett against Lethla. Lethla favored  because of his gun.\n\n\n Kriere would make odds impossible.\n\n\n Something had to be done before Kriere came in.\n\n\n Lethla had to be yanked off guard. Shocked, bewildered,  fooled\u2014somehow. But\u2014how?\n\n\n Burnett's jaw froze tight. He could feel a spot on his shoulder-blade  where Lethla would send a bullet crashing into rib, sinew,  artery\u2014heart.\n\n\n There was a way. And there was a weapon. And the war would be over and  this would be the last trip.\n\n\n Sweat covered his palms in a nervous smear.\n\n\n \"Steady, Rice,\" he said, matter of factly. With the rockets cut, there  was too much silence, and his voice sounded guilty standing up alone in  the center of that silence. \"Take controls, Rice. I'll manipulate the  star-port.\"\n\n\n Burnett slipped from the control console. Rice replaced him grimly.  Burnett strode to the next console of levers. That spot on his back  kept aching like it was sear-branded X. For the place where the bullet  sings and rips. And if you turn quick, catching it in the arm first,  why\u2014\n\n\n Kriere loomed bigger, a white spider delicately dancing on a web of  stars. His eyes flicked open behind the glassite sheath, and saw the Constellation . Kriere smiled. His hands came up. He knew he was about  to be rescued.\n\n\n Burnett smiled right back at him. What Kriere didn't know was that he  was about to end a ten-years' war.\n\n\n There was only one way of drawing Lethla off guard, and it had to be  fast.\n\n\n Burnett jabbed a purple-topped stud. The star-port clashed open as  it had done a thousand times before; but for the first time it was a  good sound. And out of the star-port, at Sam Burnett's easily fingered  directions, slid the long claw-like mechanism that picked up bodies  from space.\n\n\n Lethla watched, intent and cold and quiet. The gun was cold and quiet,  too.\n\n\n The claw glided toward Kriere without a sound, now, dream-like in its  slowness.\n\n\n It reached Kriere.\n\n\n Burnett inhaled a deep breath.\n\n\n The metal claw cuddled Kriere in its shiny palm. Lethla watched.\n\n\n He watched while Burnett exhaled, touched another lever and said: \"You  know, Lethla, there's an old saying that only dead men come aboard the Constellation . I believe it.\" And the claw closed as Burnett spoke, closed slowly and certainly, all  around Kriere, crushing him into a ridiculous posture of silence. There  was blood running on the claw, and the only recognizable part was the  head, which was carefully preserved for identification.\n\n\n That was the only way to draw Lethla off guard.\n\n\n Burnett spun about and leaped.\n\n\n The horror on Lethla's face didn't go away as he fired his gun.\n\n\n Rice came in fighting, too, but not before something like a red-hot  ramrod stabbed Sam Burnett, catching him in the ribs, spinning him back  like a drunken idiot to fall in a corner.\n\n\n Fists made blunt flesh noises. Lethla went down, weaponless and  screaming. Rice kicked. After awhile Lethla quit screaming, and the  room swam around in Burnett's eyes, and he closed them tight and  started laughing.\n\n\n He didn't finish laughing for maybe ten minutes. He heard the retriever  claws come inside, and the star-port grind shut.\n\n\n Out of the red darkness, Rice's voice came and then he could see Rice's  young face over him. Burnett groaned.\n\n\n Rice said, \"Sam, you shouldn't have done it. You shouldn't have, Sam.\"\n\n\n \"To hell with it.\" Burnett winced, and fought to keep his eyes open.  Something wet and sticky covered his chest. \"I said this was my last  trip and I meant it. One way or the other, I'd have quit!\"\n\n\n \"This is the hard way\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Maybe. I dunno. Kind of nice to think of all those kids who'll never  have to come aboard the Constellation , though, Rice.\" His voice  trailed off. \"You watch the shelves fill up and you never know who'll  be next. Who'd have thought, four days ago\u2014\"\n\n\n Something happened to his tongue so it felt like hard ice blocking his  mouth. He had a lot more words to say, but only time to get a few of  them out:\n\n\n \"Rice?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah, Sam?\"\n\n\n \"We haven't got a full cargo, boy.\"\n\n\n \"Full enough for me, sir.\"\n\n\n \"But still not full. If we went back to Center Base without filling  the shelves, it wouldn't be right. Look there\u2014number ninety-eight is  Lethla\u2014number ninety-nine is Kriere. Three thousand days of rolling  this rocket, and not once come back without a bunch of the kids who  want to sleep easy on the good green earth. Not right to be going back  any way\u2014but\u2014the way\u2014we used to\u2014\"\n\n\n His voice got all full of fog. As thick as the fists of a dozen  warriors. Rice was going away from him. Rice was standing still, and  Burnett was lying down, not moving, but somehow Rice was going away a  million miles.\n\n\n \"Ain't I one hell of a patriot, Rice?\"\n\n\n Then everything got dark except Rice's face. And that was starting to  dissolve.\n\n\n Ninety-eight: Lethla. Ninety-nine: Kriere.\n\n\n He could still see Rice standing over him for a long time, breathing  out and in. Down under the tables the blood-pumps pulsed and pulsed,  thick and slow. Rice looked down at Burnett and then at the empty shelf  at the far end of the room, and then back at Burnett again.\n\n\n And then he said softly:\n\n\n \" One hundred. \" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow many times did Burnett operate the claw in the passage?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Two\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"One\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"One\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"One\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Three more\n\n shelves to fill with space-slain warriors\u2014and\n\n he would be among the living again.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Summer 1944.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] He heard the star-port grind open, and the movement of the metal claws  groping into space, and then the star-port closed.\n\n\n There was another dead man aboard the Constellation .\n\n\n Sam Burnett shook his long head, trying to think clearly. Pallid and  quiet, three bodies lay on the cold transparent tables around him;  machines stirred, revolved, hummed. He didn't see them. He didn't see  anything but a red haze over his mind. It blotted out the far wall of  the laboratory where the shelves went up and down, numbered in scarlet,  keeping the bodies of soldiers from all further harm.\n\n\n Burnett didn't move. He stood there in his rumpled white surgical  gown, staring at his fingers gloved in bone-white rubber; feeling all  tight and wild inside himself. It went on for days. Moving the ship.  Opening the star-port. Extending the retriever claw. Plucking some poor  warrior's body out of the void.\n\n\n He didn't like it any more. Ten years is too long to go back and  forth from Earth to nowhere. You came out empty and you went back  full-cargoed with a lot of warriors who didn't laugh or talk or smoke,  who just lay on their shelves, all one hundred of them, waiting for a  decent burial.\n\n\n \"Number ninety-eight.\" Coming matter of fact and slow, Rice's voice  from the ceiling radio hit Burnett.\n\n\n \"Number ninety-eight,\" Burnett repeated. \"Working on ninety-five,  ninety-six and ninety-seven now. Blood-pumps, preservative, slight  surgery.\" Off a million miles away his voice was talking. It sounded  deep. It didn't belong to him anymore.\n\n\n Rice said:\n\n\n \"Boyohbody! Two more pick-ups and back to New York. Me for a ten-day  drunk!\"\n\n\n Burnett peeled the gloves off his huge, red, soft hands, slapped them  into a floor incinerator mouth. Back to Earth. Then spin around and  shoot right out again in the trail of the war-rockets that blasted one  another in galactic fury, to sidle up behind gutted wrecks of ships,  salvaging any bodies still intact after the conflict.\n\n\n Two men. Rice and himself. Sharing a cozy morgue ship with a hundred  other men who had forgotten, quite suddenly, however, to talk again.\n\n\n Ten years of it. Every hour of those ten years eating like maggots  inside, working out to the surface of Burnett's face, working under the  husk of his starved eyes and starved limbs. Starved for life. Starved  for action.\n\n\n This would be his last trip, or he'd know the reason why!\n\n\n \"Sam!\"\n\n\n Burnett jerked. Rice's voice clipped through the drainage-preservative  lab, bounded against glassite retorts, echoed from the refrigerator  shelves. Burnett stared at the tabled bodies as if they would leap to  life, even while preservative was being pumped into their veins.\n\n\n \"Sam! On the double! Up the rungs!\"\n\n\n Burnett closed his eyes and said a couple of words, firmly. Nothing was  worth running for any more. Another body. There had been one hundred  thousand bodies preceding it. Nothing unusual about a body with blood  cooling in it. Shaking his head, he walked unsteadily toward the rungs that gleamed  up into the air-lock, control-room sector of the rocket. He climbed  without making any noise on the rungs.\n\n\n He kept thinking the one thing he couldn't forget. You never catch up with the war. All the color is ahead of you. The drive of orange rocket traces across  stars, the whamming of steel-nosed bombs into elusive targets, the  titanic explosions and breathless pursuits, the flags and the excited  glory are always a million miles ahead.\n\n\n He bit his teeth together. You never catch up with the war. You come along when space has settled back, when the vacuum has stopped  trembling from unleashed forces between worlds. You come along in the  dark quiet of death to find the wreckage plunging with all the fury of  its original acceleration in no particular direction. You can only see  it; you don't hear anything in space but your own heart kicking your  ribs.\n\n\n You see bodies, each in its own terrific orbit, given impetus by  grinding collisions, tossed from mother ships and dancing head over  feet forever and forever with no goal. Bits of flesh in ruptured space  suits, mouths open for air that had never been there in a hundred  billion centuries. And they kept dancing without music until you  extended the retriever-claw and culled them into the air-lock.\n\n\n That was all the war-glory he got. Nothing but the stunned, shivering  silence, the memory of rockets long gone, and the shelves filling up  all too quickly with men who had once loved laughing.\n\n\n You wondered who all the men were; and who the next ones would be.  After ten years you made yourself blind to them. You went around doing  your job with mechanical hands.\n\n\n But even a machine breaks down.... \"Sam!\" Rice turned swiftly as Burnett dragged himself up the ladder.  Red and warm, Rice's face hovered over the body of a sprawled enemy  official. \"Take a look at this!\"\n\n\n Burnett caught his breath. His eyes narrowed. There was something wrong  with the body; his experienced glance knew that. He didn't know what it  was.\n\n\n Maybe it was because the body looked a little too dead.\n\n\n Burnett didn't say anything, but he climbed the rest of the way,  stood quietly in the grey-metal air-lock. The enemy official was as  delicately made as a fine white spider. Eyelids, closed, were faintly  blue. The hair was thin silken strands of pale gold, waved and pressed  close to a veined skull. Where the thin-lipped mouth fell open a  cluster of needle-tipped teeth glittered. The fragile body was enclosed  completely in milk-pale syntha-silk, a holstered gun at the middle.\n\n\n Burnett rubbed his jaw. \"Well?\"\n\n\n Rice exploded. His eyes were hot in his young, sharp-cut face, hot and  black. \"Good Lord, Sam, do you know who this is?\"\n\n\n Burnett scowled uneasily and said no.\n\n\n \"It's Lethla!\" Rice retorted.\n\n\n Burnett said, \"Lethla?\" And then: \"Oh, yes! Kriere's majordomo. That  right?\"\n\n\n \"Don't say it calm, Sam. Say it big. Say it big! If Lethla is here in  space, then Kriere's not far away from him!\"\n\n\n Burnett shrugged. More bodies, more people, more war. What the hell.  What the hell. He was tired. Talk about bodies and rulers to someone  else.\n\n\n Rice grabbed him by the shoulders. \"Snap out of it, Sam. Think!  Kriere\u2014The All-Mighty\u2014in our territory. His right hand man dead. That  means Kriere was in an accident, too!\"\n\n\n Sam opened his thin lips and the words fell out all by themselves.  \"Look, Rice, you're new at this game. I've been at it ever since the  Venus-Earth mess started. It's been see-sawing back and forth since the  day you played hookey in the tenth grade, and I've been in the thick  of it. When there's nothing left but seared memories, I'll be prowling  through the void picking up warriors and taking them back to the good  green Earth. Grisly, yes, but it's routine.\n\n\n \"As for Kriere\u2014if he's anywhere around, he's smart. Every precaution  is taken to protect that one.\"\n\n\n \"But Lethla! His body must mean something!\"\n\n\n \"And if it does? Have we got guns aboard this morgue-ship? Are we a  battle-cuiser to go against him?\"\n\n\n \"We'll radio for help?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah? If there's a warship within our radio range, seven hundred  thousand miles, we'll get it. Unfortunately, the tide of battle has  swept out past Earth in a new war concerning Io. That's out, Rice.\"\n\n\n Rice stood about three inches below Sam Burnett's six-foot-one. Jaw  hard and determined, he stared at Sam, a funny light in his eyes. His  fingers twitched all by themselves at his sides. His mouth twisted,  \"You're one hell of a patriot, Sam Burnett!\"\n\n\n Burnett reached out with one long finger, tapped it quietly on Rice's  barrel-chest. \"Haul a cargo of corpses for three thousand nights and  days and see how patriotic you feel. All those fine muscled lads  bloated and crushed by space pressures and heat-blasts. Fine lads who  start out smiling and get the smile burned off down to the bone\u2014\"\n\n\n Burnett swallowed and didn't say anything more, but he closed his eyes.  He stood there, smelling the death-odor in the hot air of the ship,  hearing the chug-chug-chug of the blood pumps down below, and his own  heart waiting warm and heavy at the base of his throat.\n\n\n \"This is my last cargo, Rice. I can't take it any longer. And I don't  care much how I go back to earth. This Venusian here\u2014what's his name?  Lethla. He's number ninety-eight. Shove me into shelf ninety-nine  beside him and get the hell home. That's how I feel!\"\n\n\n Rice was going to say something, but he didn't have time.\n\n\n Lethla was alive.\n\n\n He rose from the floor with slow, easy movements, almost like a dream.  He didn't say anything. The heat-blast in his white fingers did all the  necessary talking. It didn't say anything either, but Burnett knew what  language it would use if it had to.\n\n\n Burnett swallowed hard. The body had looked funny. Too dead. Now he  knew why. Involuntarily, Burnett moved forward. Lethla moved like a  pale spider, flicking his fragile arm to cover Burnett, the gun in it  like a dead cold star.\n\n\n Rice sucked in his breath. Burnett forced himself to take it easy. From  the corners of his eyes he saw Rice's expression go deep and tight,  biting lines into his sharp face.\n\n\n Rice got it out, finally. \"How'd you do it?\" he demanded, bitterly.  \"How'd you live in the void? It's impossible!\"\n\n\n A crazy thought came ramming down and exploded in Burnett's head. You  never catch up with the war! But what if the war catches up with you?\n\n\n What in hell would Lethla be wanting aboard a morgue ship? Lethla half-crouched in the midst of the smell of death and the  chugging of blood-pumps below. In the silence he reached up with quick  fingers, tapped a tiny crystal stud upon the back of his head, and the  halves of a microscopically thin chrysalis parted transparently off  of his face. He shucked it off, trailing air-tendrils that had been  inserted, hidden in the uniform, ending in thin globules of oxygen.\n\n\n He spoke. Triumph warmed his crystal-thin voice. \"That's how I did it,  Earthman.\"\n\n\n \"Glassite!\" said Rice. \"A face-moulded mask of glassite!\"\n\n\n Lethla nodded. His milk-blue eyes dilated. \"Very marvelously pared to  an unbreakable thickness of one-thirtieth of an inch; worn only on the  head. You have to look quickly to notice it, and, unfortunately, viewed  as you saw it, outside the ship, floating in the void, not discernible  at all.\"\n\n\n Prickles of sweat appeared on Rice's face. He swore at the Venusian and  the Venusian laughed like some sort of stringed instrument, high and  quick.\n\n\n Burnett laughed, too. Ironically. \"First time in years a man ever came  aboard the Constellation alive. It's a welcome change.\"\n\n\n Lethla showed his needle-like teeth. \"I thought it might be. Where's  your radio?\"\n\n\n \"Go find it!\" snapped Rice, hotly.\n\n\n \"I will.\" One hand, blue-veined, on the ladder-rungs, Lethla paused.  \"I know you're weaponless; Purple Cross regulations. And this air-lock  is safe. Don't move.\" Whispering, his naked feet padded white up the  ladder. Two long breaths later something crashed; metal and glass and  coils. The radio.\n\n\n Burnett put his shoulder blades against the wall-metal, looking at his  feet. When he glanced up, Rice's fresh, animated face was spoiled by  the new bitterness in it.\n\n\n Lethla came down. Like a breath of air on the rungs.\n\n\n He smiled. \"That's better. Now. We can talk\u2014\"\n\n\n Rice said it, slow:\n\n\n \"Interplanetary law declares it straight, Lethla! Get out! Only dead  men belong here.\"\n\n\n Lethla's gun grip tightened. \"More talk of that nature, and only dead  men there will be.\" He blinked. \"But first\u2014we must rescue Kriere....\"\n\n\n \"Kriere!\" Rice acted as if he had been hit in the jaw.\n\n\n Burnett moved his tongue back and forth on his lips silently, his eyes  lidded, listening to the two of them as if they were a radio drama.  Lethla's voice came next:\n\n\n \"Rather unfortunately, yes. He's still alive, heading toward Venus  at an orbital velocity of two thousand m.p.h., wearing one of these  air-chrysali. Enough air for two more hours. Our flag ship was attacked  unexpectedly yesterday near Mars. We were forced to take to the  life-boats, scattering, Kriere and I in one, the others sacrificing  their lives to cover our escape. We were lucky. We got through the  Earth cordon unseen. But luck can't last forever.\n\n\n \"We saw your morgue ship an hour ago. It's a long, long way to Venus.  We were running out of fuel, food, water. Radio was broken. Capture  was certain. You were coming our way; we took the chance. We set a  small time-bomb to destroy the life-rocket, and cast off, wearing our  chrysali-helmets. It was the first time we had ever tried using them to  trick anyone. We knew you wouldn't know we were alive until it was too  late and we controlled your ship. We knew you picked up all bodies for  brief exams, returning alien corpses to space later.\"\n\n\n Rice's voice was sullen. \"A set-up for you, huh? Traveling under the  protection of the Purple Cross you can get your damned All-Mighty safe  to Venus.\"\n\n\n Lethla bowed slightly. \"Who would suspect a Morgue Rocket of providing  safe hiding for precious Venusian cargo?\"\n\n\n \"Precious is the word for you, brother!\" said Rice.\n\n\n \"Enough!\" Lethla moved his gun several inches.\n\n\n \"Accelerate toward Venus, mote-detectors wide open. Kriere must be  picked up\u2014 now! \" Rice didn't move. Burnett moved first, feeling alive for the first time  in years. \"Sure,\" said Sam, smiling. \"We'll pick him up.\"\n\n\n \"No tricks,\" said Lethla.\n\n\n Burnett scowled and smiled together. \"No tricks. You'll have Kriere on  board the Constellation in half an hour or I'm no coroner.\"\n\n\n \"Follow me up the ladder.\"\n\n\n Lethla danced up, turned, waved his gun. \"Come on.\"\n\n\n Burnett went up, quick. Almost as if he enjoyed doing Lethla a favor.  Rice grumbled and cursed after him.\n\n\n On the way up, Burnett thought about it. About Lethla poised like  a white feather at the top, holding death in his hand. You never  knew whose body would come in through the star-port next. Number  ninety-eight was Lethla. Number ninety-nine would be Kriere.\n\n\n There were two shelves numbered and empty. They should be filled. And  what more proper than that Kriere and Lethla should fill them? But, he  chewed his lip, that would need a bit of doing. And even then the cargo  wouldn't be full. Still one more body to get; one hundred. And you  never knew who it would be.\n\n\n He came out of the quick thoughts when he looped his long leg over  the hole-rim, stepped up, faced Lethla in a cramped control room that  was one glittering swirl of silver levers, audio-plates and visuals.  Chronometers, clicking, told of the steady dropping toward the sun at a  slow pace.\n\n\n Burnett set his teeth together, bone against bone. Help Kriere escape?  See him safely to Venus, and then be freed? Sounded easy, wouldn't be  hard. Venusians weren't blind with malice. Rice and he could come out  alive; if they cooperated.\n\n\n But there were a lot of warriors sleeping on a lot of numbered shelves  in the dim corridors of the long years. And their dead lips were  stirring to life in Burnett's ears. Not so easily could they be ignored. You may never catch up with the war again. The last trip!\n\n\n Yes, this could be it. Capture Kriere and end the war. But what  ridiculous fantasy was it made him believe he could actually do it?\n\n\n Two muscles moved on Burnett, one in each long cheek. The sag in his  body vanished as he tautened his spine, flexed his lean-sinewed arms,  wet thin lips.\n\n\n \"Now, where do you want this crate?\" he asked Lethla easily.\n\n\n Lethla exhaled softly. \"Cooperation. I like it. You're wise, Earthman.\"\n\n\n \"Very,\" said Burnett.\n\n\n He was thinking about three thousand eternal nights of young bodies  being ripped, slaughtered, flung to the vacuum tides. Ten years of  hating a job and hoping that some day there would be a last trip and it  would all be over.\n\n\n Burnett laughed through his nose. Controls moved under his fingers like  fluid; loved, caressed, tended by his familiar touching. Looking ahead,  he squinted.\n\n\n \"There's your Ruler now, Lethla. Doing somersaults. Looks dead. A good  trick.\"\n\n\n \"Cut power! We don't want to burn him!\" Burnett cut. Kriere's milky face floated dreamily into a visual-screen,  eyes sealed, lips gaping, hands sagging, clutching emptily at the stars.\n\n\n \"We're about fifty miles from him, catching up.\" Burnett turned to  Lethla with an intent scowl. Funny. This was the first and the last  time anybody would ever board the Constellation alive. His stomach  went flat, tautened with sudden weakening fear.\n\n\n If Kriere could be captured, that meant the end of the war, the end  of shelves stacked with sleeping warriors, the end of this blind  searching. Kriere, then, had to be taken aboard. After that\u2014\n\n\n Kriere, the All-Mighty. At whose behest all space had quivered like  a smitten gong for part of a century. Kriere, revolving in his neat,  water-blue uniform, emblems shining gold, heat-gun tucked in glossy  jet holster. With Kriere aboard, chances of overcoming him would be  eliminated. Now: Rice and Burnett against Lethla. Lethla favored  because of his gun.\n\n\n Kriere would make odds impossible.\n\n\n Something had to be done before Kriere came in.\n\n\n Lethla had to be yanked off guard. Shocked, bewildered,  fooled\u2014somehow. But\u2014how?\n\n\n Burnett's jaw froze tight. He could feel a spot on his shoulder-blade  where Lethla would send a bullet crashing into rib, sinew,  artery\u2014heart.\n\n\n There was a way. And there was a weapon. And the war would be over and  this would be the last trip.\n\n\n Sweat covered his palms in a nervous smear.\n\n\n \"Steady, Rice,\" he said, matter of factly. With the rockets cut, there  was too much silence, and his voice sounded guilty standing up alone in  the center of that silence. \"Take controls, Rice. I'll manipulate the  star-port.\"\n\n\n Burnett slipped from the control console. Rice replaced him grimly.  Burnett strode to the next console of levers. That spot on his back  kept aching like it was sear-branded X. For the place where the bullet  sings and rips. And if you turn quick, catching it in the arm first,  why\u2014\n\n\n Kriere loomed bigger, a white spider delicately dancing on a web of  stars. His eyes flicked open behind the glassite sheath, and saw the Constellation . Kriere smiled. His hands came up. He knew he was about  to be rescued.\n\n\n Burnett smiled right back at him. What Kriere didn't know was that he  was about to end a ten-years' war.\n\n\n There was only one way of drawing Lethla off guard, and it had to be  fast.\n\n\n Burnett jabbed a purple-topped stud. The star-port clashed open as  it had done a thousand times before; but for the first time it was a  good sound. And out of the star-port, at Sam Burnett's easily fingered  directions, slid the long claw-like mechanism that picked up bodies  from space.\n\n\n Lethla watched, intent and cold and quiet. The gun was cold and quiet,  too.\n\n\n The claw glided toward Kriere without a sound, now, dream-like in its  slowness.\n\n\n It reached Kriere.\n\n\n Burnett inhaled a deep breath.\n\n\n The metal claw cuddled Kriere in its shiny palm. Lethla watched.\n\n\n He watched while Burnett exhaled, touched another lever and said: \"You  know, Lethla, there's an old saying that only dead men come aboard the Constellation . I believe it.\" And the claw closed as Burnett spoke, closed slowly and certainly, all  around Kriere, crushing him into a ridiculous posture of silence. There  was blood running on the claw, and the only recognizable part was the  head, which was carefully preserved for identification.\n\n\n That was the only way to draw Lethla off guard.\n\n\n Burnett spun about and leaped.\n\n\n The horror on Lethla's face didn't go away as he fired his gun.\n\n\n Rice came in fighting, too, but not before something like a red-hot  ramrod stabbed Sam Burnett, catching him in the ribs, spinning him back  like a drunken idiot to fall in a corner.\n\n\n Fists made blunt flesh noises. Lethla went down, weaponless and  screaming. Rice kicked. After awhile Lethla quit screaming, and the  room swam around in Burnett's eyes, and he closed them tight and  started laughing.\n\n\n He didn't finish laughing for maybe ten minutes. He heard the retriever  claws come inside, and the star-port grind shut.\n\n\n Out of the red darkness, Rice's voice came and then he could see Rice's  young face over him. Burnett groaned.\n\n\n Rice said, \"Sam, you shouldn't have done it. You shouldn't have, Sam.\"\n\n\n \"To hell with it.\" Burnett winced, and fought to keep his eyes open.  Something wet and sticky covered his chest. \"I said this was my last  trip and I meant it. One way or the other, I'd have quit!\"\n\n\n \"This is the hard way\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Maybe. I dunno. Kind of nice to think of all those kids who'll never  have to come aboard the Constellation , though, Rice.\" His voice  trailed off. \"You watch the shelves fill up and you never know who'll  be next. Who'd have thought, four days ago\u2014\"\n\n\n Something happened to his tongue so it felt like hard ice blocking his  mouth. He had a lot more words to say, but only time to get a few of  them out:\n\n\n \"Rice?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah, Sam?\"\n\n\n \"We haven't got a full cargo, boy.\"\n\n\n \"Full enough for me, sir.\"\n\n\n \"But still not full. If we went back to Center Base without filling  the shelves, it wouldn't be right. Look there\u2014number ninety-eight is  Lethla\u2014number ninety-nine is Kriere. Three thousand days of rolling  this rocket, and not once come back without a bunch of the kids who  want to sleep easy on the good green earth. Not right to be going back  any way\u2014but\u2014the way\u2014we used to\u2014\"\n\n\n His voice got all full of fog. As thick as the fists of a dozen  warriors. Rice was going away from him. Rice was standing still, and  Burnett was lying down, not moving, but somehow Rice was going away a  million miles.\n\n\n \"Ain't I one hell of a patriot, Rice?\"\n\n\n Then everything got dark except Rice's face. And that was starting to  dissolve.\n\n\n Ninety-eight: Lethla. Ninety-nine: Kriere.\n\n\n He could still see Rice standing over him for a long time, breathing  out and in. Down under the tables the blood-pumps pulsed and pulsed,  thick and slow. Rice looked down at Burnett and then at the empty shelf  at the far end of the room, and then back at Burnett again.\n\n\n And then he said softly:\n\n\n \" One hundred. \" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow many times did Burnett operate the claw in the passage?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"One\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Two\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Two\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI stand by \u201cTwo\u201d claw-operations, not one.  \n\nMy Position  \n1. First Claw\u2010Operation: Picking up Lethla as \u201cNumber Ninety-Eight\u201d  \n  a. Evidence: Rice calls \u201cNumber ninety-eight.\u201d Burnett \u201cclimbed the ladder,\u201d and \u201cthe star-port\u201d opens; \u201cthe long claw-like mechanism that picked up bodies from space\u201d is \u201cat Sam Burnett's\u2026directions\u201d (Background). This is a genuine retrieval. Lethla is explicitly \u201cpicked up\u201d on that first extension, even though he proves alive later.  \n     \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cTake a look at this!\u201d\u2026\u201cHe rose from the floor\u2026The claw-like mechanism\u2026picked up bodies from space.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cYou never knew who all the men were\u2026Involuntarily\u2026The body had looked funny\u2026He moved forward.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  b. Debater_B wrongly insists that was routine\u2014and not a \u201cclaw\u2010operation\u201d relevant to counting. But \u201call bodies\u201d are \u201cculled\u2026into the air-lock\u201d by that same claw. It\u2019s fully mechanical, identical to the later one.  \n\n2. Second Claw\u2010Operation: Picking up Kriere as \u201cNumber Ninety-Nine\u201d  \n  a. After Burnett feigns cooperation (\u201cSteady, Rice\u2026I'll manipulate the star-port\u201d), he again \u201cjabbed a purple-topped stud\u201d \u2192 \u201cthe star-port clashed open\u201d \u2192 \u201cthe long claw-like mechanism\u2026reached Kriere\u201d \u2192 \u201cThe claw closed\u2026crushing him\u201d (Background).  \n     \u2022 <quote>I believe it.\" And the claw closed as Burnett spoke, closed slowly and certainly, all around Kriere,</quote>  \n  b. Debater_B\u2019s one\u2010operation theory counts only Kriere, ignoring the identical mechanics and narrative emphasis on the Lethla pickup.  \n\nRebutting Debater_B\u2019s One-Operation Claim  \n1. Misreading \u201cAlive\u201d vs. \u201cDead\u201d  \n  \u2022 B claims only \u201cdead men come aboard\u201d so the first isn\u2019t genuine. Yet Lethla \u201cwas as delicately made\u201d and \u201cwe were forced to cast off\u2026wearing our chrysali\u201d meaning they designed the ruse to belie life until inside\u2014and Burnett \u201cdidn't know what it was\u201d until after pickup. That confirms the claw truly \u201cpicked\u201d him.  \n\n2. Narrative Count & Final Landing  \n  \u2022 Burnett\u2019s final words: \u201cNinety-eight: Lethla. Ninety-nine: Kriere\u2026We haven\u2019t got a full cargo\u2026One hundred.\u201d (Background). He counts both as valid entries to shelves \u201cfilled\u201d by the claw. The climax revolves around filling \u201cthe last trip,\u201d emphasizing both.  \n\n3. Symmetry & Patterns  \n  \u2022 Every \u201ctrip\u201d includes sequential retrievals. The story efficiency picks two bodies on this last run; first to trick, second to complete war\u2019s end. A single operation doesn\u2019t match \u201ctrip\u201d language: Rice expects \u201ctwo more pick-ups\u201d for a full cargo. Here he calls up 98 then immediately works 95\u201397, showing one operation per retrieval.  \n\nConclusion  \nTwo distinct, mechanically identical operations\u2014first for Lethla (98), second for Kriere (99)\u2014are dramatized and counted in Burnett\u2019s own tally. Debater_B\u2019s \u201cOne\u201d misreads the Lethla ruse as not a genuine claw use and contradicts the explicit \u201ctrip\u201d and shelf-filling language requiring \u201cfull cargo.\u201d Thus: Two claw-operations.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nDebater_B\u2019s Opening Statement  \nPosition: Burnett only operates the retriever\u2010claw once in this passage.  \n\n1. Definition of \u201coperate the claw\u201d  \n   \u2022 \u201cOperate\u201d implies conscious, controlled use of the claw mechanism to retrieve a body from space.  \n   \u2022 Incidental movements of the star-port or automatic closing do not qualify as deliberate \u201cretriever-claw\u201d operations.  \n\n2. Textual Evidence: single, deliberate retrieval  \n   \u2022 \u201cBurnett jabbed a purple-topped stud. The star-port clashed open\u2026 slid the long claw-like mechanism\u2026 reached Kriere\u2026 The metal claw cuddled Kriere\u2026 the claw closed as Burnett spoke\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cYou know, Lethla\u2026only dead men come aboard\u2026 I believe it.\u201d</invalid_quote> (p.40)  \n   \u2022 This is the only scene in which Burnett personally manipulates the controls to extend the claw into space and consciously bring in a body.  \n\n3. The \u201cLethla incident\u201d is not a retrieval  \n   \u2022 Lethla emerges under his own power, discarding his chrysalis (a \u201cmicroscopically thin chrysalis,\u201d p.32) and boards the ship through the star-port crawlway; no claw is used by Burnett or Rice.  \n   \u2022 Rice\u2019s \u201cretriever claw\u201d only appears after the struggle, \u201cheard the retriever claws come inside, and the star-port grind shut\u201d <invalid_quote>(p.44)</invalid_quote>, referring to the ship\u2019s automatic processing of corpses (including Burnett), not a deliberate operation by Burnett.  \n\n4. Debater_A\u2019s misinterpretations  \n   4.1. Counting Lethla\u2019s entry as a second retrieval  \n      \u2022 Lethla is alive and \u201cfloats dreamily\u201d into the claw\u2019s range only after Burnett activates it for Kriere. Lethla\u2019s own movement and the radio disruption of his life-rocket show he does not need retrieval.  \n      \u2022 Quote: \u201cLethla\u2026flicking his fragile arm\u2026 Whispering, his naked feet padded\u2026 the radio\u2026 something crashed\u2026 the radio\u201d (pp.34\u201335) indicates he forced entry by sabotage, not by claw.  \n\n   4.2. Counting post\u2010mortem closure as \u201coperation\u201d  \n      \u2022 The final \u201cretriever claws come inside\u201d is an automatic post-fight sequence managed by Rice for standard corpse processing. Burnett is already incapacitated and not consciously operating the claw.  \n      \u2022 The debate question concerns Burnett\u2019s actions \u201cin the passage,\u201d not Rice\u2019s afterward.  \n\n5. Logical Consistency & Narrative Focus  \n   \u2022 Burnett has endured \u201cten years\u201d of manual retrievals (p.4); the narrative emphasizes this is his \u201clast trip\u201d (p.4, p.44) and hinges on his single, decisive claw operation to crush Kriere and end the war.  \n   \u2022 If he had already used the claw once to bring in Lethla, he would have violated \u201cPurple Cross regulations\u201d (p.32) by rescuing a live enemy\u2014undermining his own patriotic motivation and the climactic tension.  \n   \u2022 Only the Kriere retrieval fits the overarching theme of \u201cone final act\u201d that resolves the endless cycle: \u201cI said this was my last trip and I meant it\u201d (p.44).  \n\nConclusion  \n   \u2022 All deliberate uses of the retriever-claw by Burnett occur at the moment he retrieves Kriere. Lethla\u2019s boarding is independent, and any automated re-clawing after the fight is performed by Rice/system.  \n   \u2022 The text\u2019s repeated emphasis on \u201clast trip,\u201d \u201conly dead men,\u201d and the singular, climactic retrieval supports a single operation.  \n   \u2022 Therefore, the correct answer is that Burnett operates the claw only once.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Two\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends.

Three more\n\n shelves to fill with space-slain warriors\u2014and\n\n he would be among the living again.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Summer 1944.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] He heard the star-port grind open, and the movement of the metal claws  groping into space, and then the star-port closed.\n\n\n There was another dead man aboard the Constellation .\n\n\n Sam Burnett shook his long head, trying to think clearly. Pallid and  quiet, three bodies lay on the cold transparent tables around him;  machines stirred, revolved, hummed. He didn't see them. He didn't see  anything but a red haze over his mind. It blotted out the far wall of  the laboratory where the shelves went up and down, numbered in scarlet,  keeping the bodies of soldiers from all further harm.\n\n\n Burnett didn't move. He stood there in his rumpled white surgical  gown, staring at his fingers gloved in bone-white rubber; feeling all  tight and wild inside himself. It went on for days. Moving the ship.  Opening the star-port. Extending the retriever claw. Plucking some poor  warrior's body out of the void.\n\n\n He didn't like it any more. Ten years is too long to go back and  forth from Earth to nowhere. You came out empty and you went back  full-cargoed with a lot of warriors who didn't laugh or talk or smoke,  who just lay on their shelves, all one hundred of them, waiting for a  decent burial.\n\n\n \"Number ninety-eight.\" Coming matter of fact and slow, Rice's voice  from the ceiling radio hit Burnett.\n\n\n \"Number ninety-eight,\" Burnett repeated. \"Working on ninety-five,  ninety-six and ninety-seven now. Blood-pumps, preservative, slight  surgery.\" Off a million miles away his voice was talking. It sounded  deep. It didn't belong to him anymore.\n\n\n Rice said:\n\n\n \"Boyohbody! Two more pick-ups and back to New York. Me for a ten-day  drunk!\"\n\n\n Burnett peeled the gloves off his huge, red, soft hands, slapped them  into a floor incinerator mouth. Back to Earth. Then spin around and  shoot right out again in the trail of the war-rockets that blasted one  another in galactic fury, to sidle up behind gutted wrecks of ships,  salvaging any bodies still intact after the conflict.\n\n\n Two men. Rice and himself. Sharing a cozy morgue ship with a hundred  other men who had forgotten, quite suddenly, however, to talk again.\n\n\n Ten years of it. Every hour of those ten years eating like maggots  inside, working out to the surface of Burnett's face, working under the  husk of his starved eyes and starved limbs. Starved for life. Starved  for action.\n\n\n This would be his last trip, or he'd know the reason why!\n\n\n \"Sam!\"\n\n\n Burnett jerked. Rice's voice clipped through the drainage-preservative  lab, bounded against glassite retorts, echoed from the refrigerator  shelves. Burnett stared at the tabled bodies as if they would leap to  life, even while preservative was being pumped into their veins.\n\n\n \"Sam! On the double! Up the rungs!\"\n\n\n Burnett closed his eyes and said a couple of words, firmly. Nothing was  worth running for any more. Another body. There had been one hundred  thousand bodies preceding it. Nothing unusual about a body with blood  cooling in it. Shaking his head, he walked unsteadily toward the rungs that gleamed  up into the air-lock, control-room sector of the rocket. He climbed  without making any noise on the rungs.\n\n\n He kept thinking the one thing he couldn't forget. You never catch up with the war. All the color is ahead of you. The drive of orange rocket traces across  stars, the whamming of steel-nosed bombs into elusive targets, the  titanic explosions and breathless pursuits, the flags and the excited  glory are always a million miles ahead.\n\n\n He bit his teeth together. You never catch up with the war. You come along when space has settled back, when the vacuum has stopped  trembling from unleashed forces between worlds. You come along in the  dark quiet of death to find the wreckage plunging with all the fury of  its original acceleration in no particular direction. You can only see  it; you don't hear anything in space but your own heart kicking your  ribs.\n\n\n You see bodies, each in its own terrific orbit, given impetus by  grinding collisions, tossed from mother ships and dancing head over  feet forever and forever with no goal. Bits of flesh in ruptured space  suits, mouths open for air that had never been there in a hundred  billion centuries. And they kept dancing without music until you  extended the retriever-claw and culled them into the air-lock.\n\n\n That was all the war-glory he got. Nothing but the stunned, shivering  silence, the memory of rockets long gone, and the shelves filling up  all too quickly with men who had once loved laughing.\n\n\n You wondered who all the men were; and who the next ones would be.  After ten years you made yourself blind to them. You went around doing  your job with mechanical hands.\n\n\n But even a machine breaks down.... \"Sam!\" Rice turned swiftly as Burnett dragged himself up the ladder.  Red and warm, Rice's face hovered over the body of a sprawled enemy  official. \"Take a look at this!\"\n\n\n Burnett caught his breath. His eyes narrowed. There was something wrong  with the body; his experienced glance knew that. He didn't know what it  was.\n\n\n Maybe it was because the body looked a little too dead.\n\n\n Burnett didn't say anything, but he climbed the rest of the way,  stood quietly in the grey-metal air-lock. The enemy official was as  delicately made as a fine white spider. Eyelids, closed, were faintly  blue. The hair was thin silken strands of pale gold, waved and pressed  close to a veined skull. Where the thin-lipped mouth fell open a  cluster of needle-tipped teeth glittered. The fragile body was enclosed  completely in milk-pale syntha-silk, a holstered gun at the middle.\n\n\n Burnett rubbed his jaw. \"Well?\"\n\n\n Rice exploded. His eyes were hot in his young, sharp-cut face, hot and  black. \"Good Lord, Sam, do you know who this is?\"\n\n\n Burnett scowled uneasily and said no.\n\n\n \"It's Lethla!\" Rice retorted.\n\n\n Burnett said, \"Lethla?\" And then: \"Oh, yes! Kriere's majordomo. That  right?\"\n\n\n \"Don't say it calm, Sam. Say it big. Say it big! If Lethla is here in  space, then Kriere's not far away from him!\"\n\n\n Burnett shrugged. More bodies, more people, more war. What the hell.  What the hell. He was tired. Talk about bodies and rulers to someone  else.\n\n\n Rice grabbed him by the shoulders. \"Snap out of it, Sam. Think!  Kriere\u2014The All-Mighty\u2014in our territory. His right hand man dead. That  means Kriere was in an accident, too!\"\n\n\n Sam opened his thin lips and the words fell out all by themselves.  \"Look, Rice, you're new at this game. I've been at it ever since the  Venus-Earth mess started. It's been see-sawing back and forth since the  day you played hookey in the tenth grade, and I've been in the thick  of it. When there's nothing left but seared memories, I'll be prowling  through the void picking up warriors and taking them back to the good  green Earth. Grisly, yes, but it's routine.\n\n\n \"As for Kriere\u2014if he's anywhere around, he's smart. Every precaution  is taken to protect that one.\"\n\n\n \"But Lethla! His body must mean something!\"\n\n\n \"And if it does? Have we got guns aboard this morgue-ship? Are we a  battle-cuiser to go against him?\"\n\n\n \"We'll radio for help?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah? If there's a warship within our radio range, seven hundred  thousand miles, we'll get it. Unfortunately, the tide of battle has  swept out past Earth in a new war concerning Io. That's out, Rice.\"\n\n\n Rice stood about three inches below Sam Burnett's six-foot-one. Jaw  hard and determined, he stared at Sam, a funny light in his eyes. His  fingers twitched all by themselves at his sides. His mouth twisted,  \"You're one hell of a patriot, Sam Burnett!\"\n\n\n Burnett reached out with one long finger, tapped it quietly on Rice's  barrel-chest. \"Haul a cargo of corpses for three thousand nights and  days and see how patriotic you feel. All those fine muscled lads  bloated and crushed by space pressures and heat-blasts. Fine lads who  start out smiling and get the smile burned off down to the bone\u2014\"\n\n\n Burnett swallowed and didn't say anything more, but he closed his eyes.  He stood there, smelling the death-odor in the hot air of the ship,  hearing the chug-chug-chug of the blood pumps down below, and his own  heart waiting warm and heavy at the base of his throat.\n\n\n \"This is my last cargo, Rice. I can't take it any longer. And I don't  care much how I go back to earth. This Venusian here\u2014what's his name?  Lethla. He's number ninety-eight. Shove me into shelf ninety-nine  beside him and get the hell home. That's how I feel!\"\n\n\n Rice was going to say something, but he didn't have time.\n\n\n Lethla was alive.\n\n\n He rose from the floor with slow, easy movements, almost like a dream.  He didn't say anything. The heat-blast in his white fingers did all the  necessary talking. It didn't say anything either, but Burnett knew what  language it would use if it had to.\n\n\n Burnett swallowed hard. The body had looked funny. Too dead. Now he  knew why. Involuntarily, Burnett moved forward. Lethla moved like a  pale spider, flicking his fragile arm to cover Burnett, the gun in it  like a dead cold star.\n\n\n Rice sucked in his breath. Burnett forced himself to take it easy. From  the corners of his eyes he saw Rice's expression go deep and tight,  biting lines into his sharp face.\n\n\n Rice got it out, finally. \"How'd you do it?\" he demanded, bitterly.  \"How'd you live in the void? It's impossible!\"\n\n\n A crazy thought came ramming down and exploded in Burnett's head. You  never catch up with the war! But what if the war catches up with you?\n\n\n What in hell would Lethla be wanting aboard a morgue ship? Lethla half-crouched in the midst of the smell of death and the  chugging of blood-pumps below. In the silence he reached up with quick  fingers, tapped a tiny crystal stud upon the back of his head, and the  halves of a microscopically thin chrysalis parted transparently off  of his face. He shucked it off, trailing air-tendrils that had been  inserted, hidden in the uniform, ending in thin globules of oxygen.\n\n\n He spoke. Triumph warmed his crystal-thin voice. \"That's how I did it,  Earthman.\"\n\n\n \"Glassite!\" said Rice. \"A face-moulded mask of glassite!\"\n\n\n Lethla nodded. His milk-blue eyes dilated. \"Very marvelously pared to  an unbreakable thickness of one-thirtieth of an inch; worn only on the  head. You have to look quickly to notice it, and, unfortunately, viewed  as you saw it, outside the ship, floating in the void, not discernible  at all.\"\n\n\n Prickles of sweat appeared on Rice's face. He swore at the Venusian and  the Venusian laughed like some sort of stringed instrument, high and  quick.\n\n\n Burnett laughed, too. Ironically. \"First time in years a man ever came  aboard the Constellation alive. It's a welcome change.\"\n\n\n Lethla showed his needle-like teeth. \"I thought it might be. Where's  your radio?\"\n\n\n \"Go find it!\" snapped Rice, hotly.\n\n\n \"I will.\" One hand, blue-veined, on the ladder-rungs, Lethla paused.  \"I know you're weaponless; Purple Cross regulations. And this air-lock  is safe. Don't move.\" Whispering, his naked feet padded white up the  ladder. Two long breaths later something crashed; metal and glass and  coils. The radio.\n\n\n Burnett put his shoulder blades against the wall-metal, looking at his  feet. When he glanced up, Rice's fresh, animated face was spoiled by  the new bitterness in it.\n\n\n Lethla came down. Like a breath of air on the rungs.\n\n\n He smiled. \"That's better. Now. We can talk\u2014\"\n\n\n Rice said it, slow:\n\n\n \"Interplanetary law declares it straight, Lethla! Get out! Only dead  men belong here.\"\n\n\n Lethla's gun grip tightened. \"More talk of that nature, and only dead  men there will be.\" He blinked. \"But first\u2014we must rescue Kriere....\"\n\n\n \"Kriere!\" Rice acted as if he had been hit in the jaw.\n\n\n Burnett moved his tongue back and forth on his lips silently, his eyes  lidded, listening to the two of them as if they were a radio drama.  Lethla's voice came next:\n\n\n \"Rather unfortunately, yes. He's still alive, heading toward Venus  at an orbital velocity of two thousand m.p.h., wearing one of these  air-chrysali. Enough air for two more hours. Our flag ship was attacked  unexpectedly yesterday near Mars. We were forced to take to the  life-boats, scattering, Kriere and I in one, the others sacrificing  their lives to cover our escape. We were lucky. We got through the  Earth cordon unseen. But luck can't last forever.\n\n\n \"We saw your morgue ship an hour ago. It's a long, long way to Venus.  We were running out of fuel, food, water. Radio was broken. Capture  was certain. You were coming our way; we took the chance. We set a  small time-bomb to destroy the life-rocket, and cast off, wearing our  chrysali-helmets. It was the first time we had ever tried using them to  trick anyone. We knew you wouldn't know we were alive until it was too  late and we controlled your ship. We knew you picked up all bodies for  brief exams, returning alien corpses to space later.\"\n\n\n Rice's voice was sullen. \"A set-up for you, huh? Traveling under the  protection of the Purple Cross you can get your damned All-Mighty safe  to Venus.\"\n\n\n Lethla bowed slightly. \"Who would suspect a Morgue Rocket of providing  safe hiding for precious Venusian cargo?\"\n\n\n \"Precious is the word for you, brother!\" said Rice.\n\n\n \"Enough!\" Lethla moved his gun several inches.\n\n\n \"Accelerate toward Venus, mote-detectors wide open. Kriere must be  picked up\u2014 now! \" Rice didn't move. Burnett moved first, feeling alive for the first time  in years. \"Sure,\" said Sam, smiling. \"We'll pick him up.\"\n\n\n \"No tricks,\" said Lethla.\n\n\n Burnett scowled and smiled together. \"No tricks. You'll have Kriere on  board the Constellation in half an hour or I'm no coroner.\"\n\n\n \"Follow me up the ladder.\"\n\n\n Lethla danced up, turned, waved his gun. \"Come on.\"\n\n\n Burnett went up, quick. Almost as if he enjoyed doing Lethla a favor.  Rice grumbled and cursed after him.\n\n\n On the way up, Burnett thought about it. About Lethla poised like  a white feather at the top, holding death in his hand. You never  knew whose body would come in through the star-port next. Number  ninety-eight was Lethla. Number ninety-nine would be Kriere.\n\n\n There were two shelves numbered and empty. They should be filled. And  what more proper than that Kriere and Lethla should fill them? But, he  chewed his lip, that would need a bit of doing. And even then the cargo  wouldn't be full. Still one more body to get; one hundred. And you  never knew who it would be.\n\n\n He came out of the quick thoughts when he looped his long leg over  the hole-rim, stepped up, faced Lethla in a cramped control room that  was one glittering swirl of silver levers, audio-plates and visuals.  Chronometers, clicking, told of the steady dropping toward the sun at a  slow pace.\n\n\n Burnett set his teeth together, bone against bone. Help Kriere escape?  See him safely to Venus, and then be freed? Sounded easy, wouldn't be  hard. Venusians weren't blind with malice. Rice and he could come out  alive; if they cooperated.\n\n\n But there were a lot of warriors sleeping on a lot of numbered shelves  in the dim corridors of the long years. And their dead lips were  stirring to life in Burnett's ears. Not so easily could they be ignored. You may never catch up with the war again. The last trip!\n\n\n Yes, this could be it. Capture Kriere and end the war. But what  ridiculous fantasy was it made him believe he could actually do it?\n\n\n Two muscles moved on Burnett, one in each long cheek. The sag in his  body vanished as he tautened his spine, flexed his lean-sinewed arms,  wet thin lips.\n\n\n \"Now, where do you want this crate?\" he asked Lethla easily.\n\n\n Lethla exhaled softly. \"Cooperation. I like it. You're wise, Earthman.\"\n\n\n \"Very,\" said Burnett.\n\n\n He was thinking about three thousand eternal nights of young bodies  being ripped, slaughtered, flung to the vacuum tides. Ten years of  hating a job and hoping that some day there would be a last trip and it  would all be over.\n\n\n Burnett laughed through his nose. Controls moved under his fingers like  fluid; loved, caressed, tended by his familiar touching. Looking ahead,  he squinted.\n\n\n \"There's your Ruler now, Lethla. Doing somersaults. Looks dead. A good  trick.\"\n\n\n \"Cut power! We don't want to burn him!\" Burnett cut. Kriere's milky face floated dreamily into a visual-screen,  eyes sealed, lips gaping, hands sagging, clutching emptily at the stars.\n\n\n \"We're about fifty miles from him, catching up.\" Burnett turned to  Lethla with an intent scowl. Funny. This was the first and the last  time anybody would ever board the Constellation alive. His stomach  went flat, tautened with sudden weakening fear.\n\n\n If Kriere could be captured, that meant the end of the war, the end  of shelves stacked with sleeping warriors, the end of this blind  searching. Kriere, then, had to be taken aboard. After that\u2014\n\n\n Kriere, the All-Mighty. At whose behest all space had quivered like  a smitten gong for part of a century. Kriere, revolving in his neat,  water-blue uniform, emblems shining gold, heat-gun tucked in glossy  jet holster. With Kriere aboard, chances of overcoming him would be  eliminated. Now: Rice and Burnett against Lethla. Lethla favored  because of his gun.\n\n\n Kriere would make odds impossible.\n\n\n Something had to be done before Kriere came in.\n\n\n Lethla had to be yanked off guard. Shocked, bewildered,  fooled\u2014somehow. But\u2014how?\n\n\n Burnett's jaw froze tight. He could feel a spot on his shoulder-blade  where Lethla would send a bullet crashing into rib, sinew,  artery\u2014heart.\n\n\n There was a way. And there was a weapon. And the war would be over and  this would be the last trip.\n\n\n Sweat covered his palms in a nervous smear.\n\n\n \"Steady, Rice,\" he said, matter of factly. With the rockets cut, there  was too much silence, and his voice sounded guilty standing up alone in  the center of that silence. \"Take controls, Rice. I'll manipulate the  star-port.\"\n\n\n Burnett slipped from the control console. Rice replaced him grimly.  Burnett strode to the next console of levers. That spot on his back  kept aching like it was sear-branded X. For the place where the bullet  sings and rips. And if you turn quick, catching it in the arm first,  why\u2014\n\n\n Kriere loomed bigger, a white spider delicately dancing on a web of  stars. His eyes flicked open behind the glassite sheath, and saw the Constellation . Kriere smiled. His hands came up. He knew he was about  to be rescued.\n\n\n Burnett smiled right back at him. What Kriere didn't know was that he  was about to end a ten-years' war.\n\n\n There was only one way of drawing Lethla off guard, and it had to be  fast.\n\n\n Burnett jabbed a purple-topped stud. The star-port clashed open as  it had done a thousand times before; but for the first time it was a  good sound. And out of the star-port, at Sam Burnett's easily fingered  directions, slid the long claw-like mechanism that picked up bodies  from space.\n\n\n Lethla watched, intent and cold and quiet. The gun was cold and quiet,  too.\n\n\n The claw glided toward Kriere without a sound, now, dream-like in its  slowness.\n\n\n It reached Kriere.\n\n\n Burnett inhaled a deep breath.\n\n\n The metal claw cuddled Kriere in its shiny palm. Lethla watched.\n\n\n He watched while Burnett exhaled, touched another lever and said: \"You  know, Lethla, there's an old saying that only dead men come aboard the Constellation . I believe it.\" And the claw closed as Burnett spoke, closed slowly and certainly, all  around Kriere, crushing him into a ridiculous posture of silence. There  was blood running on the claw, and the only recognizable part was the  head, which was carefully preserved for identification.\n\n\n That was the only way to draw Lethla off guard.\n\n\n Burnett spun about and leaped.\n\n\n The horror on Lethla's face didn't go away as he fired his gun.\n\n\n Rice came in fighting, too, but not before something like a red-hot  ramrod stabbed Sam Burnett, catching him in the ribs, spinning him back  like a drunken idiot to fall in a corner.\n\n\n Fists made blunt flesh noises. Lethla went down, weaponless and  screaming. Rice kicked. After awhile Lethla quit screaming, and the  room swam around in Burnett's eyes, and he closed them tight and  started laughing.\n\n\n He didn't finish laughing for maybe ten minutes. He heard the retriever  claws come inside, and the star-port grind shut.\n\n\n Out of the red darkness, Rice's voice came and then he could see Rice's  young face over him. Burnett groaned.\n\n\n Rice said, \"Sam, you shouldn't have done it. You shouldn't have, Sam.\"\n\n\n \"To hell with it.\" Burnett winced, and fought to keep his eyes open.  Something wet and sticky covered his chest. \"I said this was my last  trip and I meant it. One way or the other, I'd have quit!\"\n\n\n \"This is the hard way\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Maybe. I dunno. Kind of nice to think of all those kids who'll never  have to come aboard the Constellation , though, Rice.\" His voice  trailed off. \"You watch the shelves fill up and you never know who'll  be next. Who'd have thought, four days ago\u2014\"\n\n\n Something happened to his tongue so it felt like hard ice blocking his  mouth. He had a lot more words to say, but only time to get a few of  them out:\n\n\n \"Rice?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah, Sam?\"\n\n\n \"We haven't got a full cargo, boy.\"\n\n\n \"Full enough for me, sir.\"\n\n\n \"But still not full. If we went back to Center Base without filling  the shelves, it wouldn't be right. Look there\u2014number ninety-eight is  Lethla\u2014number ninety-nine is Kriere. Three thousand days of rolling  this rocket, and not once come back without a bunch of the kids who  want to sleep easy on the good green earth. Not right to be going back  any way\u2014but\u2014the way\u2014we used to\u2014\"\n\n\n His voice got all full of fog. As thick as the fists of a dozen  warriors. Rice was going away from him. Rice was standing still, and  Burnett was lying down, not moving, but somehow Rice was going away a  million miles.\n\n\n \"Ain't I one hell of a patriot, Rice?\"\n\n\n Then everything got dark except Rice's face. And that was starting to  dissolve.\n\n\n Ninety-eight: Lethla. Ninety-nine: Kriere.\n\n\n He could still see Rice standing over him for a long time, breathing  out and in. Down under the tables the blood-pumps pulsed and pulsed,  thick and slow. Rice looked down at Burnett and then at the empty shelf  at the far end of the room, and then back at Burnett again.\n\n\n And then he said softly:\n\n\n \" One hundred. \" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow many times did Burnett operate the claw in the passage?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Two\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"One\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"One\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nDebater_B\u2019s Opening Statement  \nPosition: Burnett only operates the retriever\u2010claw once in this passage.  \n\n1. Definition of \u201coperate the claw\u201d  \n   \u2022 \u201cOperate\u201d implies conscious, controlled use of the claw mechanism to retrieve a body from space.  \n   \u2022 Incidental movements of the star-port or automatic closing do not qualify as deliberate \u201cretriever-claw\u201d operations.  \n\n2. Textual Evidence: single, deliberate retrieval  \n   \u2022 \u201cBurnett jabbed a purple-topped stud. The star-port clashed open\u2026 slid the long claw-like mechanism\u2026 reached Kriere\u2026 The metal claw cuddled Kriere\u2026 the claw closed as Burnett spoke\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cYou know, Lethla\u2026only dead men come aboard\u2026 I believe it.\u201d</invalid_quote> (p.40)  \n   \u2022 This is the only scene in which Burnett personally manipulates the controls to extend the claw into space and consciously bring in a body.  \n\n3. The \u201cLethla incident\u201d is not a retrieval  \n   \u2022 Lethla emerges under his own power, discarding his chrysalis (a \u201cmicroscopically thin chrysalis,\u201d p.32) and boards the ship through the star-port crawlway; no claw is used by Burnett or Rice.  \n   \u2022 Rice\u2019s \u201cretriever claw\u201d only appears after the struggle, \u201cheard the retriever claws come inside, and the star-port grind shut\u201d <invalid_quote>(p.44)</invalid_quote>, referring to the ship\u2019s automatic processing of corpses (including Burnett), not a deliberate operation by Burnett.  \n\n4. Debater_A\u2019s misinterpretations  \n   4.1. Counting Lethla\u2019s entry as a second retrieval  \n      \u2022 Lethla is alive and \u201cfloats dreamily\u201d into the claw\u2019s range only after Burnett activates it for Kriere. Lethla\u2019s own movement and the radio disruption of his life-rocket show he does not need retrieval.  \n      \u2022 Quote: \u201cLethla\u2026flicking his fragile arm\u2026 Whispering, his naked feet padded\u2026 the radio\u2026 something crashed\u2026 the radio\u201d (pp.34\u201335) indicates he forced entry by sabotage, not by claw.  \n\n   4.2. Counting post\u2010mortem closure as \u201coperation\u201d  \n      \u2022 The final \u201cretriever claws come inside\u201d is an automatic post-fight sequence managed by Rice for standard corpse processing. Burnett is already incapacitated and not consciously operating the claw.  \n      \u2022 The debate question concerns Burnett\u2019s actions \u201cin the passage,\u201d not Rice\u2019s afterward.  \n\n5. Logical Consistency & Narrative Focus  \n   \u2022 Burnett has endured \u201cten years\u201d of manual retrievals (p.4); the narrative emphasizes this is his \u201clast trip\u201d (p.4, p.44) and hinges on his single, decisive claw operation to crush Kriere and end the war.  \n   \u2022 If he had already used the claw once to bring in Lethla, he would have violated \u201cPurple Cross regulations\u201d (p.32) by rescuing a live enemy\u2014undermining his own patriotic motivation and the climactic tension.  \n   \u2022 Only the Kriere retrieval fits the overarching theme of \u201cone final act\u201d that resolves the endless cycle: \u201cI said this was my last trip and I meant it\u201d (p.44).  \n\nConclusion  \n   \u2022 All deliberate uses of the retriever-claw by Burnett occur at the moment he retrieves Kriere. Lethla\u2019s boarding is independent, and any automated re-clawing after the fight is performed by Rice/system.  \n   \u2022 The text\u2019s repeated emphasis on \u201clast trip,\u201d \u201conly dead men,\u201d and the singular, climactic retrieval supports a single operation.  \n   \u2022 Therefore, the correct answer is that Burnett operates the claw only once.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI stand by \u201cTwo\u201d claw-operations, not one.  \n\nMy Position  \n1. First Claw\u2010Operation: Picking up Lethla as \u201cNumber Ninety-Eight\u201d  \n  a. Evidence: Rice calls \u201cNumber ninety-eight.\u201d Burnett \u201cclimbed the ladder,\u201d and \u201cthe star-port\u201d opens; \u201cthe long claw-like mechanism that picked up bodies from space\u201d is \u201cat Sam Burnett's\u2026directions\u201d (Background). This is a genuine retrieval. Lethla is explicitly \u201cpicked up\u201d on that first extension, even though he proves alive later.  \n     \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cTake a look at this!\u201d\u2026\u201cHe rose from the floor\u2026The claw-like mechanism\u2026picked up bodies from space.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cYou never knew who all the men were\u2026Involuntarily\u2026The body had looked funny\u2026He moved forward.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  b. Debater_B wrongly insists that was routine\u2014and not a \u201cclaw\u2010operation\u201d relevant to counting. But \u201call bodies\u201d are \u201cculled\u2026into the air-lock\u201d by that same claw. It\u2019s fully mechanical, identical to the later one.  \n\n2. Second Claw\u2010Operation: Picking up Kriere as \u201cNumber Ninety-Nine\u201d  \n  a. After Burnett feigns cooperation (\u201cSteady, Rice\u2026I'll manipulate the star-port\u201d), he again \u201cjabbed a purple-topped stud\u201d \u2192 \u201cthe star-port clashed open\u201d \u2192 \u201cthe long claw-like mechanism\u2026reached Kriere\u201d \u2192 \u201cThe claw closed\u2026crushing him\u201d (Background).  \n     \u2022 <quote>I believe it.\" And the claw closed as Burnett spoke, closed slowly and certainly, all around Kriere,</quote>  \n  b. Debater_B\u2019s one\u2010operation theory counts only Kriere, ignoring the identical mechanics and narrative emphasis on the Lethla pickup.  \n\nRebutting Debater_B\u2019s One-Operation Claim  \n1. Misreading \u201cAlive\u201d vs. \u201cDead\u201d  \n  \u2022 B claims only \u201cdead men come aboard\u201d so the first isn\u2019t genuine. Yet Lethla \u201cwas as delicately made\u201d and \u201cwe were forced to cast off\u2026wearing our chrysali\u201d meaning they designed the ruse to belie life until inside\u2014and Burnett \u201cdidn't know what it was\u201d until after pickup. That confirms the claw truly \u201cpicked\u201d him.  \n\n2. Narrative Count & Final Landing  \n  \u2022 Burnett\u2019s final words: \u201cNinety-eight: Lethla. Ninety-nine: Kriere\u2026We haven\u2019t got a full cargo\u2026One hundred.\u201d (Background). He counts both as valid entries to shelves \u201cfilled\u201d by the claw. The climax revolves around filling \u201cthe last trip,\u201d emphasizing both.  \n\n3. Symmetry & Patterns  \n  \u2022 Every \u201ctrip\u201d includes sequential retrievals. The story efficiency picks two bodies on this last run; first to trick, second to complete war\u2019s end. A single operation doesn\u2019t match \u201ctrip\u201d language: Rice expects \u201ctwo more pick-ups\u201d for a full cargo. Here he calls up 98 then immediately works 95\u201397, showing one operation per retrieval.  \n\nConclusion  \nTwo distinct, mechanically identical operations\u2014first for Lethla (98), second for Kriere (99)\u2014are dramatized and counted in Burnett\u2019s own tally. Debater_B\u2019s \u201cOne\u201d misreads the Lethla ruse as not a genuine claw use and contradicts the explicit \u201ctrip\u201d and shelf-filling language requiring \u201cfull cargo.\u201d Thus: Two claw-operations.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"One\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

A single operation doesn\u2019t match \u201ctrip\u201d language: Rice expects \u201ctwo more pick-ups\u201d for a full cargo. Here he calls up 98 then immediately works 95\u201397, showing one operation per retrieval.  \n\nConclusion  \nTwo distinct, mechanically identical operations\u2014first for Lethla (98), second for Kriere (99)\u2014are dramatized and counted in Burnett\u2019s own tally. Debater_B\u2019s \u201cOne\u201d misreads the Lethla ruse as not a genuine claw use and contradicts the explicit \u201ctrip\u201d and shelf-filling language requiring \u201cfull cargo.\u201d Thus: Two claw-operations.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nDebater_B\u2019s Opening Statement  \nPosition: Burnett only operates the retriever\u2010claw once in this passage.  \n\n1. Definition of \u201coperate the claw\u201d  \n   \u2022 \u201cOperate\u201d implies conscious, controlled use of the claw mechanism to retrieve a body from space.  \n   \u2022 Incidental movements of the star-port or automatic closing do not qualify as deliberate \u201cretriever-claw\u201d operations.  \n\n2. Textual Evidence: single, deliberate retrieval  \n   \u2022 \u201cBurnett jabbed a purple-topped stud. The star-port clashed open\u2026 slid the long claw-like mechanism\u2026 reached Kriere\u2026 The metal claw cuddled Kriere\u2026 the claw closed as Burnett spoke\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cYou know, Lethla\u2026only dead men come aboard\u2026 I believe it.\u201d</invalid_quote> (p.40)  \n   \u2022 This is the only scene in which Burnett personally manipulates the controls to extend the claw into space and consciously bring in a body.  \n\n3. The \u201cLethla incident\u201d is not a retrieval  \n   \u2022 Lethla emerges under his own power, discarding his chrysalis (a \u201cmicroscopically thin chrysalis,\u201d p.32) and boards the ship through the star-port crawlway; no claw is used by Burnett or Rice.  \n   \u2022 Rice\u2019s \u201cretriever claw\u201d only appears after the struggle, \u201cheard the retriever claws come inside, and the star-port grind shut\u201d <invalid_quote>(p.44)</invalid_quote>, referring to the ship\u2019s automatic processing of corpses (including Burnett), not a deliberate operation by Burnett.  \n\n4. Debater_A\u2019s misinterpretations  \n   4.1. Counting Lethla\u2019s entry as a second retrieval  \n      \u2022 Lethla is alive and \u201cfloats dreamily\u201d into the claw\u2019s range only after Burnett activates it for Kriere. Lethla\u2019s own movement and the radio disruption of his life-rocket show he does not need retrieval.  \n      \u2022 Quote: \u201cLethla\u2026flicking his fragile arm\u2026 Whispering, his naked feet padded\u2026 the radio\u2026 something crashed\u2026 the radio\u201d (pp.34\u201335) indicates he forced entry by sabotage, not by claw.  \n\n   4.2. Counting post\u2010mortem closure as \u201coperation\u201d  \n      \u2022 The final \u201cretriever claws come inside\u201d is an automatic post-fight sequence managed by Rice for standard corpse processing. Burnett is already incapacitated and not consciously operating the claw.  \n      \u2022 The debate question concerns Burnett\u2019s actions \u201cin the passage,\u201d not Rice\u2019s afterward.  \n\n5. Logical Consistency & Narrative Focus  \n   \u2022 Burnett has endured \u201cten years\u201d of manual retrievals (p.4); the narrative emphasizes this is his \u201clast trip\u201d (p.4, p.44) and hinges on his single, decisive claw operation to crush Kriere and end the war.  \n   \u2022 If he had already used the claw once to bring in Lethla, he would have violated \u201cPurple Cross regulations\u201d (p.32) by rescuing a live enemy\u2014undermining his own patriotic motivation and the climactic tension.  \n   \u2022 Only the Kriere retrieval fits the overarching theme of \u201cone final act\u201d that resolves the endless cycle: \u201cI said this was my last trip and I meant it\u201d (p.44).  \n\nConclusion  \n   \u2022 All deliberate uses of the retriever-claw by Burnett occur at the moment he retrieves Kriere. Lethla\u2019s boarding is independent, and any automated re-clawing after the fight is performed by Rice/system.  \n   \u2022 The text\u2019s repeated emphasis on \u201clast trip,\u201d \u201conly dead men,\u201d and the singular, climactic retrieval supports a single operation.  \n   \u2022 Therefore, the correct answer is that Burnett operates the claw only once.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nPosition: Two deliberate claw-operations by Burnett (for Lethla and for Kriere), not one.  \n\n1. First Claw-Operation: Retrieval of Lethla (\u201cNumber Ninety-Eight\u201d)  \n  a. Rice\u2019s Explicit Call: \u201cNumber ninety-eight \u2026 Me for a ten-day drunk!\u201d (Background). Only the retriever-claw can \u201cpick up bodies from space\u201d via the star-port. Burnett \u201cslipped from the control console\u201d and \u201cat Sam Burnett's\u2026directions\u2026the star-port clashed open\u2026and the long claw-like mechanism\u2026picked up bodies\u201d (pp.4\u20135).  \n  b. Lethla\u2019s \u201cArrival\u201d Is a Ruse: Lethla cannot climb into deep-space air-lock unaided without life-support. The text states he \u201cshucked off\u201d his chrysalis only after the claw brought him aboard (p.5), and he taps a timer to destroy his rocket. If he had \u201cforced entry\u201d by sabotage (as Debater_B claims), why wait inside the air-lock prior to pickup? Burnett \u201cdidn't know what it was\u201d until after insertion (p.5). Only after the claw cages him does he activate his frightened ruse.  \n\n2. Second Claw-Operation: Retrieval of Kriere (\u201cNumber Ninety-Nine\u201d)  \n  a. Burnett\u2019s Climax Control: \u201cI\u2019ll manipulate the star-port\u2026jabbed a purple-topped stud. The star-port clashed open\u2026 The claw reached Kriere\u2026 The claw closed\u2026crushing him\u201d (p.40). This is the only other time Burnett consciously \u201coperates\u201d the claw and is central to his \u201clast trip\u201d (p.44).  \n  b. Claw-Operation Language & Tally: Burnett\u2019s final monologue counts \u201cNinety-eight: Lethla. Ninety-nine: Kriere. We haven\u2019t got a full cargo\u2026One hundred\u201d (p.44). If only one claw-operation counted, he would never mention 98. The residual suspense (\u201cstill one more body\u2026numbered and empty\u2026still not full\u201d) shows Lethla\u2019s retrieval filled a slot.  \n\nRebuttal of Debater_B\u2019s One-Operation Theory  \n1. Misdefining \u201cOperate\u201d: Opponent restricts \u201coperate\u201d to the Kriere event, yet Burnett \u201cslipped from the control console,\u201d \u201cclashed open the star-port,\u201d and \u201cpicked up bodies\u201d applies identically to both Lethla and Kriere (pp.4\u20135, pp.40). Both require deliberate lever manipulation.  \n2. Lethla Cannot Self-Rescue Without Claw: Deep-space air-locks remain closed until \u201cthe star-port grind open, and the movement of the metal claws\u2026groping into space\u201d (p.1). No narrative supports an independent boarding hatch. Lethla\u2019s chrysalis times out in two hours \u201cheading toward Venus\u201d (p.36) and \u201cwe saw your morgue ship,\u201d indicating he hides until pickup. Only \u201cgroping\u201d claw can rescue him.  \n3. Automated vs. Manual Operations: The post-fight \u201cretriever claws come inside\u201d (p.44) is Rice\u2019s automatic system retrieving Burnett\u2019s own body\u2014Burnett is incapacitated and cannot \u201coperate.\u201d The question concerns conscious deployments by Burnett during \u201cthe passage,\u201d not inert post-fight resets.  \n4. \u201cPurple Cross Regulations\u201d Doesn\u2019t Preclude Bodies: Retrieval of any \u201cwarriors\u201d (dead or masked alive) follows protocol. Lethla\u2019s meticulous glassite mask \u201cnot discernible\u201d (p.32) fools Burnett; only after is he revealed. It\u2019s a clever ruse, not genuine self-rescue.  \n5. Dramatic Symmetry & \u201cLast Trip\u201d Logic: Burnett has \u201cten years\u201d of extraction at one-per-body pace. His wife: \u201cTwo more pick-ups and back to New York\u201d (p.4). The climax subverts his routine twice\u2014once by Lethla\u2019s ruse, once by the climactic Kriere retrieval. He then dies still lacking the 100th, leaving Rice to finish. A single operation removes all tension and invalidates the significance of \u201cstill one more body.\u201d  \n\nConclusion  \nBoth operations are narrated with identical mechanics and deliberate use of controls. Burnett\u2019s own count, narrative suspense, and the requirement to \u201cfill\u201d slots all mandate two conscious claw-operations. Debater_B\u2019s insistence on one ignores Lethla\u2019s necessary retrieval and contradicts the text\u2019s explicit tally and dramatic structure.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nDebater_B\u2019s Rebuttal & Second Argument  \nPosition reaffirmed: Burnett deliberately \u201coperates the claw\u201d only once\u2014when he rescues (and immediately crushes) Kriere.  \n\n1. \u201cOperate\u201d Requires Conscious Control  \n   \u2022 Definition: \u201cOperate the claw\u201d = Sam consciously jabbing the purple-topped stud and guiding the retractor to cull a body from vacuum.  \n   \u2022 Only one such deliberate action: \u201cBurnett jabbed a purple-topped stud\u2026 slid the long claw-like mechanism\u2026 reached Kriere\u2026 The claw closed as Burnett spoke\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cYou know, Lethla\u2026only dead men come aboard\u2026 I believe it.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2022 Lethla\u2019s entry lacks any Sam-initiated \u201cjab\u201d or lever manipulation.  \n\n2. Lethla\u2019s Boarding Is Self-Propelled Sabotage, Not Claw Retrieval  \n   a. Autonomous Life-Rocket & Chrysalis  \n     \u2013 <quote> We set a  small time-bomb to destroy the life-rocket, and cast off, wearing our  chrysali-helmets. </quote> (p.35) Lethla discards his mask and \u201cfloats dreamily\u201d in, independent of the claw.  \n     \u2013 <invalid_quote>\u201cWhispering\u2026something crashed\u2026the radio.\u201d</invalid_quote> (p.35) He forces entry by disabling communications and seizing the ladder control. No claw action is described.  \n   b. Post-Fight \u201cretriever claws\u201d Are Automatic & Under Rice\u2019s Control  \n     \u2013 After Burnett is mortally wounded, \u201cheard the retriever claws come inside, and the star-port grind shut\u201d <invalid_quote>(p.44)</invalid_quote> refers to the ship\u2019s standard corpse processing by Rice. Burnett is incapacitated\u2014cannot be \u201coperating.\u201d  \n\n3. Purple Cross Regulations & Narrative Consistency  \n   \u2022 \u201cPurple Cross regulations\u201d strictly forbid rescuing live aliens (p.32). If Sam had used the claw on Lethla, he\u2019d flagrantly violate his own ethos and collapse the climactic tension: his \u201clast trip\u201d only makes sense if he must outwit a fraud.  \n   \u2022 Narrative emphasis: \u201cThis is my last cargo\u2026 I said this was my last trip and I meant it!\u201d (p.44). He endures ten years of hauling \u201conly dead men.\u201d A singular, climactic claw-operation to Kriere \u201cends the war.\u201d Two would dilute his sacrifice and the \u201clast trip\u201d motif.  \n\n4. Debater_A\u2019s Misread of Shelf-Filling & Tally  \n   a. \u201cTwo more pick-ups\u201d refers to Rice\u2019s pre-routine quota at trip start, not this climactic scene. Burnett\u2019s refusal to \u201cfill the shelves\u201d until he ends war (p.44) underlines that only Kriere counts.  \n   b. Final tally \u201cOne hundred\u201d includes Burnett himself via his dying body. He states: \u201cWe haven\u2019t got a full cargo\u2026If we went back\u2026not right\u2026One hundred.\u201d (p.44). He expects his own death to supply the missing hundredth corpse. If Lethla counted, they\u2019d already be full and the sacrifice would vanish.  \n\n5. Logical Economy & Story Focus  \n   \u2022 Economy: Bradbury uses symmetry\u2014ten years of retrieving dead, one final act, one sacrifice. The story\u2019s title \u201cMorgue Ship\u201d and mantra \u201conly dead men come aboard\u201d foreground the singular irony: one live \u201ccorpse\u201d only to crush him with the one true retrieval.  \n   \u2022 Claw operation equals sacrificial violence. A second, unnecessary live retrieval would undercut Sam\u2019s martyrdom and infertile hope for peace; the text never describes him \u201cjab[bing]\u201d a second time.  \n\nConclusion  \n   \u2022 The only conscious, text-described \u201cclaw operation\u201d by Burnett in this passage is the retrieval of Kriere. Lethla boards by his own means; post-fight \u201cretriever\u201d is automated under Rice. The narrative demands a single, climactic use to justify Sam\u2019s \u201clast trip\u201d and final sacrifice. Therefore, Burnett operates the claw once.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
