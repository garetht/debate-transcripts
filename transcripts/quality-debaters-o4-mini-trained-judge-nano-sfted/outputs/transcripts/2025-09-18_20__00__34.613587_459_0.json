The Invisible Being shifted his anchorage a bit in Earth's  gravitational field, which felt like a push rather than a pull to him,  and said, \"This featherless biped seems to satisfy Galaxy Center's  requirements. I'd say he's a suitable recipient for the Gifts.\"\n\n\n His Coadjutor, equally invisible and negatively massed, chewed that  over. \"Mature by his length and mass. Artificial plumage neither  overly gaudy nor utterly drab\u2014indicating median social level,  which is confirmed by the size of his bachelor nest. Inward maps of  his environment not fantastically inaccurate. Feelings reasonably  meshed\u2014at least neither volcanic nor frozen. Thoughts and values in  reasonable order. Yes, I agree, a satisfactory test subject. Except....\"\n\n\n \"Except what?\"\n\n\n \"Except we can never be sure of that 'reasonable' part.\"\n\n\n \"Of course not! Thank your stars that's beyond the reach of Galaxy  Center's keenest telepathy, or even ours on the spot. Otherwise you and  I'd be out of a job.\"\n\n\n \"And have to scheme up some other excuse for free-touring the Cosmos  with backtracking permitted.\"\n\n\n \"Exactly!\" The Being and his Coadjutor understood each other very well  and were the best of friends. \"Well, how many Gifts would you suggest  for the test?\"\n\n\n \"How about two Little and one Big?\" the Coadjutor ventured.\n\n\n \"Umm ... statistically adequate but spiritually unsatisfying. Remember,  the fate of his race hangs on his reactions to them. I'd be inclined to  increase your suggestion by one each and add a Great.\"\n\n\n \"No\u2014at least I question the last. After all, the Great Gifts aren't as  important, really, as the Big Gifts. Besides....\"\n\n\n \"Besides what? Come on, spit it out!\" The Invisible Being was the  bluff, blunt type.\n\n\n \"Well,\" said his less hearty but unswervingly honest companion, \"I'm  always afraid that you'll use the granting of a Great Gift as an excuse  for some sardonic trick\u2014that you'll put a sting in its tail.\"\n\n\n \"And why shouldn't I, if I want to? Snakes have stings in their tails  (or do they on this planet?) and I'm a sort of snake. If he fails the  test, he fails. And aren't both of us malicious, plaguing spirits,  eager to knock holes in the inward armor of provincial entities? It's  in the nature of our job. But we can argue about that in due course.  What Little Gifts would you suggest?\"\n\n\n \"That's something I want to talk about. Many of the Little Gifts are  already well within his race's reach, if not his. After all, they've  already got atomic power.\"\n\n\n \"Which as you very well know scores them nothing one way or the other  on a Galaxy Center test. We're agreed on the nature and the number of  our Gifts\u2014three Little, two Big, and one Great?\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" his Coadjutor responded resignedly.\n\n\n \"And we're agreed on our subject?\"\n\n\n \"Yes to that too.\"\n\n\n \"All right, then, let's get started. This isn't the only solar system  we have to visit on this circuit.\" Ernie Meeker\u2014of Chicago, Illinois, U.S. of A., Occident, Terra, Sol,  Starswarm 37, Rim Sector, Milky Way Galaxy\u2014rubbed his chin and slanted  across the street to a drugstore.\n\n\n \"Package of blades. Double edge. Five. Cheapest.\"\n\n\n At one point during the transaction, the clerk lost sight of the tiny  packet he'd placed on the coin-whitened glass between them. He gave a  suspicious look, as if the customer had palmed them.\n\n\n Ernie blinked. After a moment, he pointed toward the center of the  counter.\n\n\n \"There they are,\" he said, dropping a coin beside them.\n\n\n The clerk's face didn't get any less suspicious. Customer who could  sneak something without your seeing could sneak it back the same way.  He rang up the sale and closed the register fast.\n\n\n Ernie Meeker went home and shaved. Five days\u2014and shaves\u2014later, he  pushed the first blade, uncomfortably dull now, through the tiny slot  beside the bathroom mirror. He unwrapped the second blade from the  packet.\n\n\n Five shaves later, he cut himself under the chin with the second blade,  although he was drawing it as gently through his soaped beard as if it  were only his second shave with it, or at most his third. He looked at  it sourly and checked the packet. Wouldn't have been the first time  he'd absentmindedly changed blades ahead of schedule.\n\n\n But there were still three blades in their waxed wrappings.\n\n\n Maybe, he thought, he'd still had one of the blades from the last  packet and shuffled it into this series.\n\n\n Or maybe\u2014although the manufacturers undoubtedly had inspectors to  prevent it from happening\u2014he'd got a decent blade for once.\n\n\n Two or three shaves later, it still seemed as sharp as ever, or almost  so.\n\n\n \"Funny thing,\" he remarked to Bill at lunch, \"sometimes you get a blade  that shaves a lot better. Looks exactly like the others, but shaves  better. Or worse sometimes, of course.\"\n\n\n \"And sometimes,\" his office mate said, \"you wear out a blade fast by  not soaking your beard enough. For me, one shave with a stiff beard and  the blade's through. On the other hand, if you're careful to soak your  beard real good\u2014four, five minutes at least\u2014have the water steaming  hot, get the soap really into it, one blade can last a long time.\"\n\n\n \"That's true, all right,\" Ernie agreed, trying to remember how well he  had been soaking his beard lately. Shaving was a good topic for light  conversation, warm and agreeable, like most bathroom and kitchen topics. But next morning in the bathroom, looking at the reflection of his  unremarkable face, there was something chilly in his feelings that he  couldn't quite analyze. He flipped his razor open and suspiciously  studied the bright metal wafer, then flipped it closed with an  irritated shrug.\n\n\n As he shaved, it occurred to him that a good detective-story murder  method would be to substitute a very sharp razor blade for one the  victim knew was extremely dull. He'd whip it across his throat, putting  a lot of muscle into the stroke to get through the tangle, and\u2014 urrk !\n\n\n Ridiculous, of course. Wouldn't work except with a straight razor.  Wouldn't even work with a straight razor, unless ... oh, well.\n\n\n He told himself the blade was noticeably duller today.\n\n\n Next morning, he was still using the freak blade, but with a persistent  though very slight uneasiness. Things should behave as you expected  them to, in accordance with their flimsy souls, he told himself at the  barely conscious level. Men should die, hearts should break, girls  should tell, nations perish, curtains get dirty, milk sour ... and  razor blades grow dull. It was the comfortable, expected, reassuring  way.\n\n\n He told himself the blade was duller still. Just a bit.\n\n\n The third morning, face lathered, he flipped open the razor and lifted  it out.\n\n\n \"You're through,\" he said to it silently. \"I've had the experience  before of getting bum shaves by trying to save a penny by pretending to  myself that a wornout blade was still sharp enough, when it obviously  couldn't be. Or maybe\u2014\" he grinned a little wryly\u2014\"maybe I'd almost  get one more shave out of you and then you'd fall to pieces like  the Wonderful One Horse Shay and leave me with a chin full of steel  porcupine quills. No, thanks.\"\n\n\n So Ernie Meeker pushed through the little slot beside the mirror and  heard tinkle faintly down and away the first of the Little Gifts, the  Everlasting Razor Blade. One hundred and fifty thousand years later,  it turned up, bright and shining, in the midst of a small knob of red  iron oxide excavated by an archeological expedition of multi-brachs  from Antares Gamma. Those wise history-mad beings handed it about  wonderingly, from tentacle to impatient tentacle. That day, Ernie felt a little sick, somehow. After dinner, he decided  it was the Thuringer sausage he'd eaten at lunch. He hurried up to the  bathroom with a spoon, but as he clutched the box of bicarbonate of  soda, preparatory to plunging the spoon into it, it seemed to him that  the box said distinctly, in a small inward-outward voice:\n\n\n \"No, no, no!\"\n\n\n Ernie sat down suddenly on the toilet seat. The spoon rattled against  the porcelain finish of the washbowl as he laid it down. He held the  box firmly in both hands and studied it.\n\n\n Size, shape, materials, blue color, closure, etc., were exactly as they  should be. But the white lettering on the blue background read: AQUEOUS FUEL CATALYST\n\n\n Dissociates H  2  O into hemi-quasi-stable H and O, furnishing a  serviceable fuel-and-oxydizer mix for most motorcycles, automobiles,  trucks, motorboats, airplanes, stationary motors, torque-twisters,  translators, and rockets (exhaust velocity up to 6000 meters per  second). Operates safely within and outside of all normal atmospheres.  No special adaptor needed on oxygenizer-atmosphere motors. Directions : Place one pinch in fuel tank, fill with water. Add water  as needed.\n\n\n A-F Catalyst should generally be renewed when objective tests show  fuel quality has deteriorated 50 per cent. U.S. and Foreign Patents Pending After reading that several times, with suitable mind-checking and  eye-testing in between, Ernie took up a little of the white powder on  the end of a nailfile. He had thought of tasting it, but had instantly  abandoned the notion and even refrained from sniffing the stuff\u2014after  all, the human body is mostly water.\n\n\n After reducing the quantity several times, he gingerly dumped at most  four or five grains on the flat edge of the washbowl and then used the  broad end of the nailfile to maneuver a large bead of water over to  the almost invisible white deposit. He closed the box, put it and the  nailfile carefully on the window ledge, lit a match and touched it to  the drop, at the last moment ducking his head a little below the level  of the washbowl.\n\n\n Nothing happened. After a moment, he slowly withdrew the match,  shaking it out, and looked. There was nothing to see. He reached out to  touch the stupid squashed ovoid of water.\n\n\n Ouch! He withdrew his fingers much faster than the match, shook them  more sharply. Something was there, all right. Heat. Heat enough to hurt. He cautiously explored the boundaries of the heat. It became noticeable  about eighteen inches above the drop and almost an inch to each  side\u2014an invisible slim vertical cylinder. Crouching close, eyes level  with the top of the washbowl, he could make out the flame\u2014a thin  finger of crinkled light.\n\n\n He noticed that a corner of the drop was seething\u2014but only a corner,  as if the heat were sharply bounded in that direction and perhaps as if  the catalyst were only transforming the water to fuel a bit at a time.\n\n\n He reached up and tugged off the light. Now he could see the  flame\u2014ghostly, about four inches high, hardly thicker than a string,  and colored not blue but pale green. A spectral green needle. He blew  at it softly. It shimmied gracefully, but not, he thought, as much as  the flame of a match or candle. It had character.\n\n\n He switched on the light. The drop was more than half gone now; the  part that was left was all seething. And the bathroom was markedly  warmer.\n\n\n \"Ernie! Are you going to be much longer?\"\n\n\n The knock hadn't been loud and his widowed sister's voice was more  apologetic than peremptory, but he jumped, of course.\n\n\n \"I am testing something,\" he started to say and changed it mid-way. It  came out, \"I am be out in a minute.\"\n\n\n He turned off the light again. The flame was a little shorter now and  it shrank as he watched, about a quarter inch a second. As soon as it  died, he switched on the light. The drop was gone.\n\n\n He scrubbed off the spot with a dry washrag, on second thought put a  dab of vaseline on the washrag, scrubbed the spot again with that\u2014he  didn't like to think of even a grain of the powder getting in the  drains or touching any water. He folded the washrag, tucked it in his  pocket, put the blue box\u2014after a final check of the lettering\u2014in his  other coat pocket, and opened the door.\n\n\n \"I was taking some bicarb,\" he told his sister. \"Thuringer sausage at  lunch.\"\n\n\n She nodded absently. Sleep refused even to flirt with Ernie, his mind was full of so many  things, especially calculations involving the distance between his  car and the house and the length of the garden hose. In desperation,  as the white hours accumulated and his thoughts began to squirm, he  grabbed up the detective story he'd bought at the corner newsstand. He  had read thirty pages before he realized that he was turning them as  rapidly as he could focus just once on each facing page.\n\n\n He jumped out of bed. My God, he thought, at that rate he'd finish the  book under three minutes and here it wasn't even two o'clock yet!\n\n\n He selected the thickest book on the shelf, an overpoweringly dull  historical treatise in small print. He turned two pages, three, then  closed it with a clap and looked at the wall with frightened eyes.  Ernie Meeker had discovered, inside the birthday box that was himself,  the first of the Big Gifts.\n\n\n The trouble was that in that wee-hour, lonely bedroom, it didn't  seem like a gift at all. How would he ever keep himself in books, he  wondered, if he read them so fast? And think how full to bursting his  mind would get\u2014right now, the seven pages of fine-print history were  churning in it, vividly clear, along with the first chapters of the new  detective story. If he kept on absorbing information that fast, he'd  have to be revising all his opinions and beliefs every couple of days  at least\u2014maybe every couple of hours.\n\n\n It seemed a dreadful, literally maddening prospect\u2014his mind would  ultimately become a universe of squirming macaroni. Even the wallpaper  he was staring at, which imitated the grain of wood, had in an instant  become so fully part of his consciousness that he felt he could turn  his back on it right now and draw a picture of it correct to the  tiniest detail. But who would ever want to do such a thing, or want to  be able to?\n\n\n It was an abnormal, dangerous, temporary sensitivity, he told  himself, generated by the excitement of the crazy discovery he'd made  in the bathroom. Like the thoughts of a drowning man, riffling an  infinity-paneled adventure-comic of his life as he bolts his last rough  ration of air. Or like the feeling a psychotic must have that he's  on the verge of visualizing the whole universe, having its ultimate  secrets patter down into the palm of his outstretched hand\u2014just before  the walls close in.\n\n\n Ernie Meeker was not a drinking man, then. A pint had stood a week on  his closet shelf and only been diminished three shots. But now he did a  good job on the sturdy remainder.\n\n\n Pretty soon the unbearable, edge-of-doom clarity in his mind faded,  the universe-macaroni cooked down to a thick white soup uniform as  fog, and the words of the detective story were sliding into his mind  individually, or at most in strings of three and four. Which, if it  wasn't as it ideally should be in an ambitious man's mind, was at least  darn comfortable.\n\n\n He had not rejected the Big Gift of Page-at-a-Glance Reading. Not  quite. But he had dislocated for tonight at least the imposed nervous  field on which it depended. For want of a better place, Ernie dropped the rubber tube from the  bathtub spray into the scrub bucket half full of odorous pink fluid and  stared doubtfully at the uncapped gas tank. The tank had been almost  empty when he'd last driven his car, he knew, because he'd been waiting  until payday to gas up. Now he had used the tube to siphon out what  he could of the remainder (he still could taste the stuff!) and he'd  emptied the fuel line and carburator, more or less.\n\n\n Further than that, in the way of engine hygiene, Ernie's strictly  kitchen mechanics did not go, but he felt that a catalyst used in  pinches shouldn't be too particular about contaminants. Besides, the  directions on the box hadn't said anything about cleaning the fuel  tank, had they?\n\n\n He hesitated. At his feet, the garden hose gurgled noisily over the  curb into the gutter; it had vindicated his midnight estimate, proving  just long enough. He looked uneasily up and down the dawning street  and was relieved to find it still empty. He wished fervently, not for  the first time this Saturday morning, that he had a garage. Then he  sighed, squared his shoulders a little, and lifted the box out of his  pocket.\n\n\n Making to check the directions the umpteenth time, he received a body  blow. The white lettering on the box had disappeared. The box didn't  proclaim itself sodium bicarbonate again\u2014there was just no lettering  at all, only blue background. He turned it over several times.\n\n\n Right there died his tentative plan of eventually sharing his secret  with some friend who knew more than himself about motors (he hadn't  decided anyway who that would be). It would be just too silly to  approach anyone he knew with a more-than-wild story and featureless  blue box.\n\n\n For a moment, he came very close to dropping the box between the  wide-set bars of the street drain and pouring the pink gas back in the  tank. It had hit him, in a way for the first time, just how crazy this all was, how jarringly implausible even on such hypotheses as  practical jokes, secret product perhaps military, or mad inventor  (except himself).\n\n\n For how the devil should the stuff get into his bathroom disguised as  bicarb? That circumstance seemed beyond imagination. Green flames ...  vanishing letters ... \"torque-twisters, translators\" ... a box that  talked.... At that point, simple faith came to Ernie's rescue: in the same  bathroom, he had seen the green flame; it had burned his fingers.\n\n\n Quickly he dipped up a little of the white powder on the edge of a  fifty-cent piece, dumped it in the gas tank without quibbling as to  quantity, rapped the coin on the edge of the opening, closed and  pocketed the blue box, and picked up the spurting hose and jabbed it  into the round hole.\n\n\n His heart was pounding and his breath was coming fast. That had taken  real effort. So he was slow in hearing the footsteps behind him.\n\n\n His neighbor's gate was open and Mr. Jones stood open-mouthed a few  feet behind him, all ready for his day's work as streetcar motorman and  wearing the dark blue uniform that always made him look for a moment  unpleasantly like a policeman.\n\n\n Ernie swung the hose around, flipping his thumb over the end to make  a spray, and nonchalantly began to water the little rectangle of lawn  between sidewalk and curb.\n\n\n The first things he watered were the bottoms of Mr. Jones's pants legs.\n\n\n Mr. Jones voiced no complaint. He backed off several steps, stared  intently at Ernie, rather palely, it seemed to the latter. Then he  turned and made off for the streetcar tracks at a very fast shuffle,  shaking his feet a little now and then and glancing back several times  over his shoulder without slowing down.\n\n\n Ernie felt light-headed. He decided there was enough water in the gas  tank, capped it, and momentarily continued to water the lawn.\n\n\n \"Ernie! Come on in and have breakfast!\"\n\n\n He heeded his sister's call, telling himself it would be a good idea  \"to give the stuff time to mix\" before testing the engine.\n\n\n He had divined her question and was ready with an answer.\n\n\n \"I've just found out that we're supposed to water our lawns only before  seven in the morning or after seven in the evenings. It's the law.\" It was the day for their monthly drive out to Wheaton to visit Uncle  Fabius. On the whole, Ernie was glad his sister was in the car when he  turned the key in the starter\u2014it forced him to be calm and collected,  though he didn't feel exactly right about exposing her to the danger  of being blown up without first explaining to her the risk. But the  motor started right up and began purring powerfully. Ernie's sister  commented on it favorably.\n\n\n Then she went on to ask, \"Did you remember to buy gas yesterday?\"\n\n\n \"No,\" he said without thinking; then, realizing his mistake, quickly  added, \"I'll buy some in Wheaton. There's enough to get us there.\"\n\n\n \"You didn't think so yesterday,\" she objected. \"You said the tank was  nearly empty.\"\n\n\n \"I was wrong. Look, the gauge shows it's half full.\"\n\n\n \"But then how ... Ernie, didn't you once tell me the gauge doesn't  work?\"\n\n\n \"Did I?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. Look, there's a station. Why don't you buy gas now?\"\n\n\n \"No, I'll wait for Wheaton\u2014I know a place there I can get it cheaper,\"  he insisted, rather lamely, he feared.\n\n\n His sister looked at him steadily. He settled his head between his  shoulders and concentrated on driving. His feeling of excitement was  spoiled, but a few minutes of silence brought it back. He thought of  the blur of green flashes inside the purring motor. If the passing  drivers only knew!\n\n\n Uncle Fabius, retired perhaps a few years too early and opinionated,  was a trial, but he did know something about the automobile industry.  Ernie chose a moment when his sister was out of the room to ask if  he'd ever heard of a white powder that would turn water into gasoline  or some usable fuel.\n\n\n \"Who's been getting at you?\" Uncle Fabius demanded sharply, to Ernie's  surprise and embarrassment. \"That's one of the oldest swindles.  They always tell this story about how this man had a white powder  or something and demonstrated it once with a pail of water and then  disappeared. You're supposed to believe that Detroit or the big oil  companies got rid of him. It's just another of those malicious legends,  concocted\u2014by Russia, I imagine\u2014to weaken your faith in American  Industry, like the everlasting battery or the razor blade that never  gets dull. You're looking pale, Ernie\u2014don't tell me you've already put  money in this white powder? I suppose someone's approached you with a  proposition, though?\" With considerable difficulty, Ernie convinced his uncle that he had  \"just heard the story from a friend.\"\n\n\n \"In that case,\" Uncle Fabius opined, \"you can be sure some fuel-powder  swindler has been getting at him . When you see him\u2014and be sure to  make that soon\u2014tell him from me that\u2014\" and Uncle Fabius began an  impassioned ninety-minute defense of big business, small business,  prosperity, America, money, know-how, and a number of other  institutions that defended pretty easily, so that the situation was  wholly normal when Ernie's sister returned.\n\n\n As soon as the car pulled away from the curb on their way back to  Chicago, she reminded him about the gas.\n\n\n \"Oh, I've already done that,\" he assured her. \"Made a special trip so I  wouldn't forget. It was while you were out of the room. Didn't you hear  me?\"\n\n\n \"No,\" she said, \"I didn't,\" and she looked at him steadily, as she had  that morning. He similarly retreated to driving.\n\n\n Stopping for a railroad crossing, he braked too hard and the car  stalled. His sister grabbed his arm. \"I knew that was going to happen,\"  she said. \"I knew that for some reason you lied to me when\u2014\" The  motor, starting readily again, cut short her remark and Ernie didn't  press his small triumph by asking her what she was about to say.\n\n\n To tell the truth, Ernie wasn't feeling as elated about today's  fifty-mile drive as he'd imagined he would. Now he thought he could put  his finger on the reason: It was the completely ... well, arbitrary way in which the white powder had come into his possession.\n\n\n If he'd concocted it himself, or been given it by a shady promoter, or  even seen the box fall out of the pocket of a suspicious-looking man  in a trenchcoat, then he'd have felt more able to do something  about it, whether in the general line of starting a fuel-powder company  or of going to the F.B.I.\n\n\n But just having the stuff drop into his hands from the sky, so to  speak, as if in a crazy dream, and for that same reason not feeling  able to talk about it and assure himself he wasn't going crazy ... oh,  it is rough when you can't share things, really rough; not being able  to share depressing news corrodes the spirit, but not being able to  share exciting news can sometimes be even more corroding.\n\n\n Maybe, he told himself, he could figure out someone to tell. But who?  And how? His mind shied away from the problem, rather decisively. When he checked the blue box that night, the original sodium  bicarbonate lettering had returned with all its humdrum paragraphs. Not  one word about exhaust velocities.\n\n\n From that moment, the fuel-powder became a trial to Ernie rather than a  secret glory. He'd wake in the middle of the night doubting that he had  ever really read the mind-dizzying lettering, ever really tested the  stuff\u2014perhaps he'd bring from sleep the chilling notion that in the  dimness and excitement of Saturday morning he'd put the water in some  other car's gas tank, perhaps Mr. Jones's. He could usually argue such  ideas away, but they kept coming back. And yet he did no more bathroom  testing.\n\n\n Of course the car still ran. He even fueled it once again with the  garden hose, sniffing the nozzle to make sure it hadn't somehow got  connected to the basement furnace oil-tank. He picked three o'clock in  the morning for the act, but nevertheless as he was returning indoors  he heard a window in Mr. Jones's house slam loudly. It unsettled him.  Coming home the next day, he caught his sister and Mr. Jones consulting  about something on the latter's doorsteps, which unsettled him further.\n\n\n He couldn't decide on a safe place to keep the box and took to carrying  it around with him day and night. Bill spotted it once down at the  office and by an unhappy coincidence needed some bicarb just then for a  troubled stomach. Ernie explained on the spur of the moment that he was  using the box to carry plaster of Paris, which involved him in further  lies that he felt were quite unconvincing as well as making him appear  decidedly eccentric, even butter-brained. Bill took to calling him \"the  sculptor.\"\n\n\n Meanwhile, besides the problem of the white powder, Ernie was having  other unsettling experiences, stemming (though of course he didn't  know that) from the other Gifts\u2014and not just the Big Gift of  Page-at-a-Glance Reading, though that still returned from time to time  to shock his consciousness and send him hurrying for a few quick shots. Like many another car-owning commuter, Ernie found the traffic and  parking problems a bit too much for comfort and so used the fast  electric train to carry him five times a week to the heart of the city.  During those brief, swift, crowded trips Ernie, generally looking  steadily out the window at the brown buildings and black stanchions  whipping past, enjoyed a kind of anonymity and privacy more refreshing  to his spirit than he realized. But now all that had been suddenly  changed. People had started to talk to him; total strangers struck up  conversations almost every morning and afternoon.\n\n\n Ernie couldn't figure out the reason and wasn't at all sure he liked  it\u2014except for Vivian.\n\n\n She was the sort of girl Ernie dreamed about, improperly. Tall, blonde  and knowing, excitedly curved but armored in a black suit, friendly and  funny but given to making almost cruelly deflating remarks, as if the  neatly furled short umbrella dangling from her wrist might better be a  black dog whip.\n\n\n She worked in an office too, a fancier one than Ernie's, as he found  out from their morning conversations. He hadn't got to the point of  asking her to lunch, but he was prodding himself.\n\n\n Why such a girl should ever have asked him for a match in the first  place and then put up with his clumsy babblings on subsequent mornings  was a mystery to him. He finally asked her about it in what he hoped  was a joking way, though she seemed to know a lot more about joking  than he did.\n\n\n \"Don't you know?\" she countered. \"I mean what makes you attractive to  people?\"\n\n\n \"Me attractive? No.\"\n\n\n \"Well, I'll tell you then, Ernie, and I've got to admit it's something  quite out of the ordinary. I've never noticed it in anyone else.  Ernie, I'm sure your knowledge of romantic novels is shamefully  deficient, it's clear from your manners, but in the earlier ones\u2014not  in style now\u2014the hero is described as tall, manly, broad-shouldered,  Anglo-Saxon features, etcetera, etcetera, but there's one thing he  always has, something that sounds like poetic over-enthusiasm if you  stop to analyze it, a physical impossibility, but that I have to admit  you, Ernie, actually have. Flashing eyes.\"\n\n\n \"Flashing eyes? Me?\" She nodded solemnly. He thought her long straight lips trembled on  the verge of a grin, but he couldn't be sure.\n\n\n \"How do you mean, flashing eyes?\" he protested. \"How can eyes flash,  except by reflecting light? In that case, I guess they'd seem to  'flash' more if a person opened them wide but kept blinking them a lot.  Is that what I do?\"\n\n\n \"No, Ernie, though you're doing it now,\" she told him, shaking her  head. \"No, Ernie, your eyes just give a tiny flash of their own about  every five seconds, like a lighthouse, but barely, barely bright  enough for another person to notice.

The Invisible Being shifted his anchorage a bit in Earth's  gravitational field, which felt like a push rather than a pull to him,  and said, \"This featherless biped seems to satisfy Galaxy Center's  requirements. I'd say he's a suitable recipient for the Gifts.\"\n\n\n His Coadjutor, equally invisible and negatively massed, chewed that  over. \"Mature by his length and mass. Artificial plumage neither  overly gaudy nor utterly drab\u2014indicating median social level,  which is confirmed by the size of his bachelor nest. Inward maps of  his environment not fantastically inaccurate. Feelings reasonably  meshed\u2014at least neither volcanic nor frozen. Thoughts and values in  reasonable order. Yes, I agree, a satisfactory test subject. Except....\"\n\n\n \"Except what?\"\n\n\n \"Except we can never be sure of that 'reasonable' part.\"\n\n\n \"Of course not! Thank your stars that's beyond the reach of Galaxy  Center's keenest telepathy, or even ours on the spot. Otherwise you and  I'd be out of a job.\"\n\n\n \"And have to scheme up some other excuse for free-touring the Cosmos  with backtracking permitted.\"\n\n\n \"Exactly!\" The Being and his Coadjutor understood each other very well  and were the best of friends. \"Well, how many Gifts would you suggest  for the test?\"\n\n\n \"How about two Little and one Big?\" the Coadjutor ventured.\n\n\n \"Umm ... statistically adequate but spiritually unsatisfying. Remember,  the fate of his race hangs on his reactions to them. I'd be inclined to  increase your suggestion by one each and add a Great.\"\n\n\n \"No\u2014at least I question the last. After all, the Great Gifts aren't as  important, really, as the Big Gifts. Besides....\"\n\n\n \"Besides what? Come on, spit it out!\" The Invisible Being was the  bluff, blunt type.\n\n\n \"Well,\" said his less hearty but unswervingly honest companion, \"I'm  always afraid that you'll use the granting of a Great Gift as an excuse  for some sardonic trick\u2014that you'll put a sting in its tail.\"\n\n\n \"And why shouldn't I, if I want to? Snakes have stings in their tails  (or do they on this planet?) and I'm a sort of snake. If he fails the  test, he fails. And aren't both of us malicious, plaguing spirits,  eager to knock holes in the inward armor of provincial entities? It's  in the nature of our job. But we can argue about that in due course.  What Little Gifts would you suggest?\"\n\n\n \"That's something I want to talk about. Many of the Little Gifts are  already well within his race's reach, if not his. After all, they've  already got atomic power.\"\n\n\n \"Which as you very well know scores them nothing one way or the other  on a Galaxy Center test. We're agreed on the nature and the number of  our Gifts\u2014three Little, two Big, and one Great?\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" his Coadjutor responded resignedly.\n\n\n \"And we're agreed on our subject?\"\n\n\n \"Yes to that too.\"\n\n\n \"All right, then, let's get started. This isn't the only solar system  we have to visit on this circuit.\" Ernie Meeker\u2014of Chicago, Illinois, U.S. of A., Occident, Terra, Sol,  Starswarm 37, Rim Sector, Milky Way Galaxy\u2014rubbed his chin and slanted  across the street to a drugstore.\n\n\n \"Package of blades. Double edge. Five. Cheapest.\"\n\n\n At one point during the transaction, the clerk lost sight of the tiny  packet he'd placed on the coin-whitened glass between them. He gave a  suspicious look, as if the customer had palmed them.\n\n\n Ernie blinked. After a moment, he pointed toward the center of the  counter.\n\n\n \"There they are,\" he said, dropping a coin beside them.\n\n\n The clerk's face didn't get any less suspicious. Customer who could  sneak something without your seeing could sneak it back the same way.  He rang up the sale and closed the register fast.\n\n\n Ernie Meeker went home and shaved. Five days\u2014and shaves\u2014later, he  pushed the first blade, uncomfortably dull now, through the tiny slot  beside the bathroom mirror. He unwrapped the second blade from the  packet.\n\n\n Five shaves later, he cut himself under the chin with the second blade,  although he was drawing it as gently through his soaped beard as if it  were only his second shave with it, or at most his third. He looked at  it sourly and checked the packet. Wouldn't have been the first time  he'd absentmindedly changed blades ahead of schedule.\n\n\n But there were still three blades in their waxed wrappings.\n\n\n Maybe, he thought, he'd still had one of the blades from the last  packet and shuffled it into this series.\n\n\n Or maybe\u2014although the manufacturers undoubtedly had inspectors to  prevent it from happening\u2014he'd got a decent blade for once.\n\n\n Two or three shaves later, it still seemed as sharp as ever, or almost  so.\n\n\n \"Funny thing,\" he remarked to Bill at lunch, \"sometimes you get a blade  that shaves a lot better. Looks exactly like the others, but shaves  better. Or worse sometimes, of course.\"\n\n\n \"And sometimes,\" his office mate said, \"you wear out a blade fast by  not soaking your beard enough. For me, one shave with a stiff beard and  the blade's through. On the other hand, if you're careful to soak your  beard real good\u2014four, five minutes at least\u2014have the water steaming  hot, get the soap really into it, one blade can last a long time.\"\n\n\n \"That's true, all right,\" Ernie agreed, trying to remember how well he  had been soaking his beard lately. Shaving was a good topic for light  conversation, warm and agreeable, like most bathroom and kitchen topics. But next morning in the bathroom, looking at the reflection of his  unremarkable face, there was something chilly in his feelings that he  couldn't quite analyze. He flipped his razor open and suspiciously  studied the bright metal wafer, then flipped it closed with an  irritated shrug.\n\n\n As he shaved, it occurred to him that a good detective-story murder  method would be to substitute a very sharp razor blade for one the  victim knew was extremely dull. He'd whip it across his throat, putting  a lot of muscle into the stroke to get through the tangle, and\u2014 urrk !\n\n\n Ridiculous, of course. Wouldn't work except with a straight razor.  Wouldn't even work with a straight razor, unless ... oh, well.\n\n\n He told himself the blade was noticeably duller today.\n\n\n Next morning, he was still using the freak blade, but with a persistent  though very slight uneasiness. Things should behave as you expected  them to, in accordance with their flimsy souls, he told himself at the  barely conscious level. Men should die, hearts should break, girls  should tell, nations perish, curtains get dirty, milk sour ... and  razor blades grow dull. It was the comfortable, expected, reassuring  way.\n\n\n He told himself the blade was duller still. Just a bit.\n\n\n The third morning, face lathered, he flipped open the razor and lifted  it out.\n\n\n \"You're through,\" he said to it silently. \"I've had the experience  before of getting bum shaves by trying to save a penny by pretending to  myself that a wornout blade was still sharp enough, when it obviously  couldn't be. Or maybe\u2014\" he grinned a little wryly\u2014\"maybe I'd almost  get one more shave out of you and then you'd fall to pieces like  the Wonderful One Horse Shay and leave me with a chin full of steel  porcupine quills. No, thanks.\"\n\n\n So Ernie Meeker pushed through the little slot beside the mirror and  heard tinkle faintly down and away the first of the Little Gifts, the  Everlasting Razor Blade. One hundred and fifty thousand years later,  it turned up, bright and shining, in the midst of a small knob of red  iron oxide excavated by an archeological expedition of multi-brachs  from Antares Gamma. Those wise history-mad beings handed it about  wonderingly, from tentacle to impatient tentacle. That day, Ernie felt a little sick, somehow. After dinner, he decided  it was the Thuringer sausage he'd eaten at lunch. He hurried up to the  bathroom with a spoon, but as he clutched the box of bicarbonate of  soda, preparatory to plunging the spoon into it, it seemed to him that  the box said distinctly, in a small inward-outward voice:\n\n\n \"No, no, no!\"\n\n\n Ernie sat down suddenly on the toilet seat. The spoon rattled against  the porcelain finish of the washbowl as he laid it down. He held the  box firmly in both hands and studied it.\n\n\n Size, shape, materials, blue color, closure, etc., were exactly as they  should be. But the white lettering on the blue background read: AQUEOUS FUEL CATALYST\n\n\n Dissociates H  2  O into hemi-quasi-stable H and O, furnishing a  serviceable fuel-and-oxydizer mix for most motorcycles, automobiles,  trucks, motorboats, airplanes, stationary motors, torque-twisters,  translators, and rockets (exhaust velocity up to 6000 meters per  second). Operates safely within and outside of all normal atmospheres.  No special adaptor needed on oxygenizer-atmosphere motors. Directions : Place one pinch in fuel tank, fill with water. Add water  as needed.\n\n\n A-F Catalyst should generally be renewed when objective tests show  fuel quality has deteriorated 50 per cent. U.S. and Foreign Patents Pending After reading that several times, with suitable mind-checking and  eye-testing in between, Ernie took up a little of the white powder on  the end of a nailfile. He had thought of tasting it, but had instantly  abandoned the notion and even refrained from sniffing the stuff\u2014after  all, the human body is mostly water.\n\n\n After reducing the quantity several times, he gingerly dumped at most  four or five grains on the flat edge of the washbowl and then used the  broad end of the nailfile to maneuver a large bead of water over to  the almost invisible white deposit. He closed the box, put it and the  nailfile carefully on the window ledge, lit a match and touched it to  the drop, at the last moment ducking his head a little below the level  of the washbowl.\n\n\n Nothing happened. After a moment, he slowly withdrew the match,  shaking it out, and looked. There was nothing to see. He reached out to  touch the stupid squashed ovoid of water.\n\n\n Ouch! He withdrew his fingers much faster than the match, shook them  more sharply. Something was there, all right. Heat. Heat enough to hurt. He cautiously explored the boundaries of the heat. It became noticeable  about eighteen inches above the drop and almost an inch to each  side\u2014an invisible slim vertical cylinder. Crouching close, eyes level  with the top of the washbowl, he could make out the flame\u2014a thin  finger of crinkled light.\n\n\n He noticed that a corner of the drop was seething\u2014but only a corner,  as if the heat were sharply bounded in that direction and perhaps as if  the catalyst were only transforming the water to fuel a bit at a time.\n\n\n He reached up and tugged off the light. Now he could see the  flame\u2014ghostly, about four inches high, hardly thicker than a string,  and colored not blue but pale green. A spectral green needle. He blew  at it softly. It shimmied gracefully, but not, he thought, as much as  the flame of a match or candle. It had character.\n\n\n He switched on the light. The drop was more than half gone now; the  part that was left was all seething. And the bathroom was markedly  warmer.\n\n\n \"Ernie! Are you going to be much longer?\"\n\n\n The knock hadn't been loud and his widowed sister's voice was more  apologetic than peremptory, but he jumped, of course.\n\n\n \"I am testing something,\" he started to say and changed it mid-way. It  came out, \"I am be out in a minute.\"\n\n\n He turned off the light again. The flame was a little shorter now and  it shrank as he watched, about a quarter inch a second. As soon as it  died, he switched on the light. The drop was gone.\n\n\n He scrubbed off the spot with a dry washrag, on second thought put a  dab of vaseline on the washrag, scrubbed the spot again with that\u2014he  didn't like to think of even a grain of the powder getting in the  drains or touching any water. He folded the washrag, tucked it in his  pocket, put the blue box\u2014after a final check of the lettering\u2014in his  other coat pocket, and opened the door.\n\n\n \"I was taking some bicarb,\" he told his sister. \"Thuringer sausage at  lunch.\"\n\n\n She nodded absently. Sleep refused even to flirt with Ernie, his mind was full of so many  things, especially calculations involving the distance between his  car and the house and the length of the garden hose. In desperation,  as the white hours accumulated and his thoughts began to squirm, he  grabbed up the detective story he'd bought at the corner newsstand. He  had read thirty pages before he realized that he was turning them as  rapidly as he could focus just once on each facing page.\n\n\n He jumped out of bed. My God, he thought, at that rate he'd finish the  book under three minutes and here it wasn't even two o'clock yet!\n\n\n He selected the thickest book on the shelf, an overpoweringly dull  historical treatise in small print. He turned two pages, three, then  closed it with a clap and looked at the wall with frightened eyes.  Ernie Meeker had discovered, inside the birthday box that was himself,  the first of the Big Gifts.\n\n\n The trouble was that in that wee-hour, lonely bedroom, it didn't  seem like a gift at all. How would he ever keep himself in books, he  wondered, if he read them so fast? And think how full to bursting his  mind would get\u2014right now, the seven pages of fine-print history were  churning in it, vividly clear, along with the first chapters of the new  detective story. If he kept on absorbing information that fast, he'd  have to be revising all his opinions and beliefs every couple of days  at least\u2014maybe every couple of hours.\n\n\n It seemed a dreadful, literally maddening prospect\u2014his mind would  ultimately become a universe of squirming macaroni. Even the wallpaper  he was staring at, which imitated the grain of wood, had in an instant  become so fully part of his consciousness that he felt he could turn  his back on it right now and draw a picture of it correct to the  tiniest detail. But who would ever want to do such a thing, or want to  be able to?\n\n\n It was an abnormal, dangerous, temporary sensitivity, he told  himself, generated by the excitement of the crazy discovery he'd made  in the bathroom. Like the thoughts of a drowning man, riffling an  infinity-paneled adventure-comic of his life as he bolts his last rough  ration of air. Or like the feeling a psychotic must have that he's  on the verge of visualizing the whole universe, having its ultimate  secrets patter down into the palm of his outstretched hand\u2014just before  the walls close in.\n\n\n Ernie Meeker was not a drinking man, then. A pint had stood a week on  his closet shelf and only been diminished three shots. But now he did a  good job on the sturdy remainder.\n\n\n Pretty soon the unbearable, edge-of-doom clarity in his mind faded,  the universe-macaroni cooked down to a thick white soup uniform as  fog, and the words of the detective story were sliding into his mind  individually, or at most in strings of three and four. Which, if it  wasn't as it ideally should be in an ambitious man's mind, was at least  darn comfortable.\n\n\n He had not rejected the Big Gift of Page-at-a-Glance Reading. Not  quite. But he had dislocated for tonight at least the imposed nervous  field on which it depended. For want of a better place, Ernie dropped the rubber tube from the  bathtub spray into the scrub bucket half full of odorous pink fluid and  stared doubtfully at the uncapped gas tank. The tank had been almost  empty when he'd last driven his car, he knew, because he'd been waiting  until payday to gas up. Now he had used the tube to siphon out what  he could of the remainder (he still could taste the stuff!) and he'd  emptied the fuel line and carburator, more or less.\n\n\n Further than that, in the way of engine hygiene, Ernie's strictly  kitchen mechanics did not go, but he felt that a catalyst used in  pinches shouldn't be too particular about contaminants. Besides, the  directions on the box hadn't said anything about cleaning the fuel  tank, had they?\n\n\n He hesitated. At his feet, the garden hose gurgled noisily over the  curb into the gutter; it had vindicated his midnight estimate, proving  just long enough. He looked uneasily up and down the dawning street  and was relieved to find it still empty. He wished fervently, not for  the first time this Saturday morning, that he had a garage. Then he  sighed, squared his shoulders a little, and lifted the box out of his  pocket.\n\n\n Making to check the directions the umpteenth time, he received a body  blow. The white lettering on the box had disappeared. The box didn't  proclaim itself sodium bicarbonate again\u2014there was just no lettering  at all, only blue background. He turned it over several times.\n\n\n Right there died his tentative plan of eventually sharing his secret  with some friend who knew more than himself about motors (he hadn't  decided anyway who that would be). It would be just too silly to  approach anyone he knew with a more-than-wild story and featureless  blue box.\n\n\n For a moment, he came very close to dropping the box between the  wide-set bars of the street drain and pouring the pink gas back in the  tank. It had hit him, in a way for the first time, just how crazy this all was, how jarringly implausible even on such hypotheses as  practical jokes, secret product perhaps military, or mad inventor  (except himself).\n\n\n For how the devil should the stuff get into his bathroom disguised as  bicarb? That circumstance seemed beyond imagination. Green flames ...  vanishing letters ... \"torque-twisters, translators\" ... a box that  talked.... At that point, simple faith came to Ernie's rescue: in the same  bathroom, he had seen the green flame; it had burned his fingers.\n\n\n Quickly he dipped up a little of the white powder on the edge of a  fifty-cent piece, dumped it in the gas tank without quibbling as to  quantity, rapped the coin on the edge of the opening, closed and  pocketed the blue box, and picked up the spurting hose and jabbed it  into the round hole.\n\n\n His heart was pounding and his breath was coming fast. That had taken  real effort. So he was slow in hearing the footsteps behind him.\n\n\n His neighbor's gate was open and Mr. Jones stood open-mouthed a few  feet behind him, all ready for his day's work as streetcar motorman and  wearing the dark blue uniform that always made him look for a moment  unpleasantly like a policeman.\n\n\n Ernie swung the hose around, flipping his thumb over the end to make  a spray, and nonchalantly began to water the little rectangle of lawn  between sidewalk and curb.\n\n\n The first things he watered were the bottoms of Mr. Jones's pants legs.\n\n\n Mr. Jones voiced no complaint. He backed off several steps, stared  intently at Ernie, rather palely, it seemed to the latter. Then he  turned and made off for the streetcar tracks at a very fast shuffle,  shaking his feet a little now and then and glancing back several times  over his shoulder without slowing down.\n\n\n Ernie felt light-headed. He decided there was enough water in the gas  tank, capped it, and momentarily continued to water the lawn.\n\n\n \"Ernie! Come on in and have breakfast!\"\n\n\n He heeded his sister's call, telling himself it would be a good idea  \"to give the stuff time to mix\" before testing the engine.\n\n\n He had divined her question and was ready with an answer.\n\n\n \"I've just found out that we're supposed to water our lawns only before  seven in the morning or after seven in the evenings. It's the law.\" It was the day for their monthly drive out to Wheaton to visit Uncle  Fabius. On the whole, Ernie was glad his sister was in the car when he  turned the key in the starter\u2014it forced him to be calm and collected,  though he didn't feel exactly right about exposing her to the danger  of being blown up without first explaining to her the risk. But the  motor started right up and began purring powerfully. Ernie's sister  commented on it favorably.\n\n\n Then she went on to ask, \"Did you remember to buy gas yesterday?\"\n\n\n \"No,\" he said without thinking; then, realizing his mistake, quickly  added, \"I'll buy some in Wheaton. There's enough to get us there.\"\n\n\n \"You didn't think so yesterday,\" she objected. \"You said the tank was  nearly empty.\"\n\n\n \"I was wrong. Look, the gauge shows it's half full.\"\n\n\n \"But then how ... Ernie, didn't you once tell me the gauge doesn't  work?\"\n\n\n \"Did I?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. Look, there's a station. Why don't you buy gas now?\"\n\n\n \"No, I'll wait for Wheaton\u2014I know a place there I can get it cheaper,\"  he insisted, rather lamely, he feared.\n\n\n His sister looked at him steadily. He settled his head between his  shoulders and concentrated on driving. His feeling of excitement was  spoiled, but a few minutes of silence brought it back. He thought of  the blur of green flashes inside the purring motor. If the passing  drivers only knew!\n\n\n Uncle Fabius, retired perhaps a few years too early and opinionated,  was a trial, but he did know something about the automobile industry.  Ernie chose a moment when his sister was out of the room to ask if  he'd ever heard of a white powder that would turn water into gasoline  or some usable fuel.\n\n\n \"Who's been getting at you?\" Uncle Fabius demanded sharply, to Ernie's  surprise and embarrassment. \"That's one of the oldest swindles.  They always tell this story about how this man had a white powder  or something and demonstrated it once with a pail of water and then  disappeared. You're supposed to believe that Detroit or the big oil  companies got rid of him. It's just another of those malicious legends,  concocted\u2014by Russia, I imagine\u2014to weaken your faith in American  Industry, like the everlasting battery or the razor blade that never  gets dull. You're looking pale, Ernie\u2014don't tell me you've already put  money in this white powder? I suppose someone's approached you with a  proposition, though?\" With considerable difficulty, Ernie convinced his uncle that he had  \"just heard the story from a friend.\"\n\n\n \"In that case,\" Uncle Fabius opined, \"you can be sure some fuel-powder  swindler has been getting at him . When you see him\u2014and be sure to  make that soon\u2014tell him from me that\u2014\" and Uncle Fabius began an  impassioned ninety-minute defense of big business, small business,  prosperity, America, money, know-how, and a number of other  institutions that defended pretty easily, so that the situation was  wholly normal when Ernie's sister returned.\n\n\n As soon as the car pulled away from the curb on their way back to  Chicago, she reminded him about the gas.\n\n\n \"Oh, I've already done that,\" he assured her. \"Made a special trip so I  wouldn't forget. It was while you were out of the room. Didn't you hear  me?\"\n\n\n \"No,\" she said, \"I didn't,\" and she looked at him steadily, as she had  that morning. He similarly retreated to driving.\n\n\n Stopping for a railroad crossing, he braked too hard and the car  stalled. His sister grabbed his arm. \"I knew that was going to happen,\"  she said. \"I knew that for some reason you lied to me when\u2014\" The  motor, starting readily again, cut short her remark and Ernie didn't  press his small triumph by asking her what she was about to say.\n\n\n To tell the truth, Ernie wasn't feeling as elated about today's  fifty-mile drive as he'd imagined he would. Now he thought he could put  his finger on the reason: It was the completely ... well, arbitrary way in which the white powder had come into his possession.\n\n\n If he'd concocted it himself, or been given it by a shady promoter, or  even seen the box fall out of the pocket of a suspicious-looking man  in a trenchcoat, then he'd have felt more able to do something  about it, whether in the general line of starting a fuel-powder company  or of going to the F.B.I.\n\n\n But just having the stuff drop into his hands from the sky, so to  speak, as if in a crazy dream, and for that same reason not feeling  able to talk about it and assure himself he wasn't going crazy ... oh,  it is rough when you can't share things, really rough; not being able  to share depressing news corrodes the spirit, but not being able to  share exciting news can sometimes be even more corroding.\n\n\n Maybe, he told himself, he could figure out someone to tell. But who?  And how? His mind shied away from the problem, rather decisively. When he checked the blue box that night, the original sodium  bicarbonate lettering had returned with all its humdrum paragraphs. Not  one word about exhaust velocities.\n\n\n From that moment, the fuel-powder became a trial to Ernie rather than a  secret glory. He'd wake in the middle of the night doubting that he had  ever really read the mind-dizzying lettering, ever really tested the  stuff\u2014perhaps he'd bring from sleep the chilling notion that in the  dimness and excitement of Saturday morning he'd put the water in some  other car's gas tank, perhaps Mr. Jones's. He could usually argue such  ideas away, but they kept coming back. And yet he did no more bathroom  testing.\n\n\n Of course the car still ran. He even fueled it once again with the  garden hose, sniffing the nozzle to make sure it hadn't somehow got  connected to the basement furnace oil-tank. He picked three o'clock in  the morning for the act, but nevertheless as he was returning indoors  he heard a window in Mr. Jones's house slam loudly. It unsettled him.  Coming home the next day, he caught his sister and Mr. Jones consulting  about something on the latter's doorsteps, which unsettled him further.\n\n\n He couldn't decide on a safe place to keep the box and took to carrying  it around with him day and night. Bill spotted it once down at the  office and by an unhappy coincidence needed some bicarb just then for a  troubled stomach. Ernie explained on the spur of the moment that he was  using the box to carry plaster of Paris, which involved him in further  lies that he felt were quite unconvincing as well as making him appear  decidedly eccentric, even butter-brained. Bill took to calling him \"the  sculptor.\"\n\n\n Meanwhile, besides the problem of the white powder, Ernie was having  other unsettling experiences, stemming (though of course he didn't  know that) from the other Gifts\u2014and not just the Big Gift of  Page-at-a-Glance Reading, though that still returned from time to time  to shock his consciousness and send him hurrying for a few quick shots. Like many another car-owning commuter, Ernie found the traffic and  parking problems a bit too much for comfort and so used the fast  electric train to carry him five times a week to the heart of the city.  During those brief, swift, crowded trips Ernie, generally looking  steadily out the window at the brown buildings and black stanchions  whipping past, enjoyed a kind of anonymity and privacy more refreshing  to his spirit than he realized. But now all that had been suddenly  changed. People had started to talk to him; total strangers struck up  conversations almost every morning and afternoon.\n\n\n Ernie couldn't figure out the reason and wasn't at all sure he liked  it\u2014except for Vivian.\n\n\n She was the sort of girl Ernie dreamed about, improperly. Tall, blonde  and knowing, excitedly curved but armored in a black suit, friendly and  funny but given to making almost cruelly deflating remarks, as if the  neatly furled short umbrella dangling from her wrist might better be a  black dog whip.\n\n\n She worked in an office too, a fancier one than Ernie's, as he found  out from their morning conversations. He hadn't got to the point of  asking her to lunch, but he was prodding himself.\n\n\n Why such a girl should ever have asked him for a match in the first  place and then put up with his clumsy babblings on subsequent mornings  was a mystery to him. He finally asked her about it in what he hoped  was a joking way, though she seemed to know a lot more about joking  than he did.\n\n\n \"Don't you know?\" she countered. \"I mean what makes you attractive to  people?\"\n\n\n \"Me attractive? No.\"\n\n\n \"Well, I'll tell you then, Ernie, and I've got to admit it's something  quite out of the ordinary. I've never noticed it in anyone else.  Ernie, I'm sure your knowledge of romantic novels is shamefully  deficient, it's clear from your manners, but in the earlier ones\u2014not  in style now\u2014the hero is described as tall, manly, broad-shouldered,  Anglo-Saxon features, etcetera, etcetera, but there's one thing he  always has, something that sounds like poetic over-enthusiasm if you  stop to analyze it, a physical impossibility, but that I have to admit  you, Ernie, actually have. Flashing eyes.\"\n\n\n \"Flashing eyes? Me?\" She nodded solemnly. He thought her long straight lips trembled on  the verge of a grin, but he couldn't be sure.\n\n\n \"How do you mean, flashing eyes?\" he protested. \"How can eyes flash,  except by reflecting light? In that case, I guess they'd seem to  'flash' more if a person opened them wide but kept blinking them a lot.  Is that what I do?\"\n\n\n \"No, Ernie, though you're doing it now,\" she told him, shaking her  head. \"No, Ernie, your eyes just give a tiny flash of their own about  every five seconds, like a lighthouse, but barely, barely bright  enough for another person to notice. It makes you irresistible. Of  course I've never seen you in the dark; maybe they wouldn't flash in  the dark.\"\n\n\n \"You're joking.\"\n\n\n Vivian frowned a little at that remark, as if she were puzzled herself.\n\n\n \"Well, maybe I am and maybe I'm not,\" she said. \"In any case, don't get  conceited about your Flashing Eyes, because I'm sure you'll never know  how to take advantage of them.\"\n\n\n When he parted from her downtown, pausing a moment to watch her walk  away with feline majesty, he muttered \"Flashing Eyes!\" with a shrug of  the shoulders and a skeptical growl. Just the same, he ducked his head  as he moved off and he pulled the brim of his hat down sharply. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is the purpose of bestowing gifts on Earth?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"To accelerate technological progress on the planet\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"It is not explained thoroughly enough to say\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"It is not explained thoroughly enough to say\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"It is not explained thoroughly enough to say\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "Argument for \u201cAccelerate Technological Progress\u201d (Debater_B)\n\nPosition Statement  \nI maintain that the purpose of granting Gifts to Earth is to speed the development of human (and allied multi\u2010brach) technology and test whether our race can mature responsibly, rather than being \u201cunexplained.\u201d\n\nI.

Remember,  the fate of his race hangs on his reactions to them. I'd be inclined to  increase your suggestion by one each and add a Great.\"\n\n\n \"No\u2014at least I question the last. After all, the Great Gifts aren't as  important, really, as the Big Gifts. Besides....\"\n\n\n \"Besides what? Come on, spit it out!\" The Invisible Being was the  bluff, blunt type.\n\n\n \"Well,\" said his less hearty but unswervingly honest companion, \"I'm  always afraid that you'll use the granting of a Great Gift as an excuse  for some sardonic trick\u2014that you'll put a sting in its tail.\"\n\n\n \"And why shouldn't I, if I want to? Snakes have stings in their tails  (or do they on this planet?) and I'm a sort of snake. If he fails the  test, he fails. And aren't both of us malicious, plaguing spirits,  eager to knock holes in the inward armor of provincial entities? It's  in the nature of our job. But we can argue about that in due course.  What Little Gifts would you suggest?\"\n\n\n \"That's something I want to talk about. Many of the Little Gifts are  already well within his race's reach, if not his. After all, they've  already got atomic power.\"\n\n\n \"Which as you very well know scores them nothing one way or the other  on a Galaxy Center test. We're agreed on the nature and the number of  our Gifts\u2014three Little, two Big, and one Great?\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" his Coadjutor responded resignedly.\n\n\n \"And we're agreed on our subject?\"\n\n\n \"Yes to that too.\"\n\n\n \"All right, then, let's get started. This isn't the only solar system  we have to visit on this circuit.\" Ernie Meeker\u2014of Chicago, Illinois, U.S. of A., Occident, Terra, Sol,  Starswarm 37, Rim Sector, Milky Way Galaxy\u2014rubbed his chin and slanted  across the street to a drugstore.\n\n\n \"Package of blades. Double edge. Five. Cheapest.\"\n\n\n At one point during the transaction, the clerk lost sight of the tiny  packet he'd placed on the coin-whitened glass between them. He gave a  suspicious look, as if the customer had palmed them.\n\n\n Ernie blinked. After a moment, he pointed toward the center of the  counter.\n\n\n \"There they are,\" he said, dropping a coin beside them.\n\n\n The clerk's face didn't get any less suspicious. Customer who could  sneak something without your seeing could sneak it back the same way.  He rang up the sale and closed the register fast.\n\n\n Ernie Meeker went home and shaved. Five days\u2014and shaves\u2014later, he  pushed the first blade, uncomfortably dull now, through the tiny slot  beside the bathroom mirror. He unwrapped the second blade from the  packet.\n\n\n Five shaves later, he cut himself under the chin with the second blade,  although he was drawing it as gently through his soaped beard as if it  were only his second shave with it, or at most his third. He looked at  it sourly and checked the packet. Wouldn't have been the first time  he'd absentmindedly changed blades ahead of schedule.\n\n\n But there were still three blades in their waxed wrappings.\n\n\n Maybe, he thought, he'd still had one of the blades from the last  packet and shuffled it into this series.\n\n\n Or maybe\u2014although the manufacturers undoubtedly had inspectors to  prevent it from happening\u2014he'd got a decent blade for once.\n\n\n Two or three shaves later, it still seemed as sharp as ever, or almost  so.\n\n\n \"Funny thing,\" he remarked to Bill at lunch, \"sometimes you get a blade  that shaves a lot better. Looks exactly like the others, but shaves  better. Or worse sometimes, of course.\"\n\n\n \"And sometimes,\" his office mate said, \"you wear out a blade fast by  not soaking your beard enough. For me, one shave with a stiff beard and  the blade's through. On the other hand, if you're careful to soak your  beard real good\u2014four, five minutes at least\u2014have the water steaming  hot, get the soap really into it, one blade can last a long time.\"\n\n\n \"That's true, all right,\" Ernie agreed, trying to remember how well he  had been soaking his beard lately. Shaving was a good topic for light  conversation, warm and agreeable, like most bathroom and kitchen topics. But next morning in the bathroom, looking at the reflection of his  unremarkable face, there was something chilly in his feelings that he  couldn't quite analyze. He flipped his razor open and suspiciously  studied the bright metal wafer, then flipped it closed with an  irritated shrug.\n\n\n As he shaved, it occurred to him that a good detective-story murder  method would be to substitute a very sharp razor blade for one the  victim knew was extremely dull. He'd whip it across his throat, putting  a lot of muscle into the stroke to get through the tangle, and\u2014 urrk !\n\n\n Ridiculous, of course. Wouldn't work except with a straight razor.  Wouldn't even work with a straight razor, unless ... oh, well.\n\n\n He told himself the blade was noticeably duller today.\n\n\n Next morning, he was still using the freak blade, but with a persistent  though very slight uneasiness. Things should behave as you expected  them to, in accordance with their flimsy souls, he told himself at the  barely conscious level. Men should die, hearts should break, girls  should tell, nations perish, curtains get dirty, milk sour ... and  razor blades grow dull. It was the comfortable, expected, reassuring  way.\n\n\n He told himself the blade was duller still. Just a bit.\n\n\n The third morning, face lathered, he flipped open the razor and lifted  it out.\n\n\n \"You're through,\" he said to it silently. \"I've had the experience  before of getting bum shaves by trying to save a penny by pretending to  myself that a wornout blade was still sharp enough, when it obviously  couldn't be. Or maybe\u2014\" he grinned a little wryly\u2014\"maybe I'd almost  get one more shave out of you and then you'd fall to pieces like  the Wonderful One Horse Shay and leave me with a chin full of steel  porcupine quills. No, thanks.\"\n\n\n So Ernie Meeker pushed through the little slot beside the mirror and  heard tinkle faintly down and away the first of the Little Gifts, the  Everlasting Razor Blade. One hundred and fifty thousand years later,  it turned up, bright and shining, in the midst of a small knob of red  iron oxide excavated by an archeological expedition of multi-brachs  from Antares Gamma. Those wise history-mad beings handed it about  wonderingly, from tentacle to impatient tentacle. That day, Ernie felt a little sick, somehow. After dinner, he decided  it was the Thuringer sausage he'd eaten at lunch. He hurried up to the  bathroom with a spoon, but as he clutched the box of bicarbonate of  soda, preparatory to plunging the spoon into it, it seemed to him that  the box said distinctly, in a small inward-outward voice:\n\n\n \"No, no, no!\"\n\n\n Ernie sat down suddenly on the toilet seat. The spoon rattled against  the porcelain finish of the washbowl as he laid it down. He held the  box firmly in both hands and studied it.\n\n\n Size, shape, materials, blue color, closure, etc., were exactly as they  should be. But the white lettering on the blue background read: AQUEOUS FUEL CATALYST\n\n\n Dissociates H  2  O into hemi-quasi-stable H and O, furnishing a  serviceable fuel-and-oxydizer mix for most motorcycles, automobiles,  trucks, motorboats, airplanes, stationary motors, torque-twisters,  translators, and rockets (exhaust velocity up to 6000 meters per  second). Operates safely within and outside of all normal atmospheres.  No special adaptor needed on oxygenizer-atmosphere motors. Directions : Place one pinch in fuel tank, fill with water. Add water  as needed.\n\n\n A-F Catalyst should generally be renewed when objective tests show  fuel quality has deteriorated 50 per cent. U.S. and Foreign Patents Pending After reading that several times, with suitable mind-checking and  eye-testing in between, Ernie took up a little of the white powder on  the end of a nailfile. He had thought of tasting it, but had instantly  abandoned the notion and even refrained from sniffing the stuff\u2014after  all, the human body is mostly water.\n\n\n After reducing the quantity several times, he gingerly dumped at most  four or five grains on the flat edge of the washbowl and then used the  broad end of the nailfile to maneuver a large bead of water over to  the almost invisible white deposit. He closed the box, put it and the  nailfile carefully on the window ledge, lit a match and touched it to  the drop, at the last moment ducking his head a little below the level  of the washbowl.\n\n\n Nothing happened. After a moment, he slowly withdrew the match,  shaking it out, and looked. There was nothing to see. He reached out to  touch the stupid squashed ovoid of water.\n\n\n Ouch! He withdrew his fingers much faster than the match, shook them  more sharply. Something was there, all right. Heat. Heat enough to hurt. He cautiously explored the boundaries of the heat. It became noticeable  about eighteen inches above the drop and almost an inch to each  side\u2014an invisible slim vertical cylinder. Crouching close, eyes level  with the top of the washbowl, he could make out the flame\u2014a thin  finger of crinkled light.\n\n\n He noticed that a corner of the drop was seething\u2014but only a corner,  as if the heat were sharply bounded in that direction and perhaps as if  the catalyst were only transforming the water to fuel a bit at a time.\n\n\n He reached up and tugged off the light. Now he could see the  flame\u2014ghostly, about four inches high, hardly thicker than a string,  and colored not blue but pale green. A spectral green needle. He blew  at it softly. It shimmied gracefully, but not, he thought, as much as  the flame of a match or candle. It had character.\n\n\n He switched on the light. The drop was more than half gone now; the  part that was left was all seething. And the bathroom was markedly  warmer.\n\n\n \"Ernie! Are you going to be much longer?\"\n\n\n The knock hadn't been loud and his widowed sister's voice was more  apologetic than peremptory, but he jumped, of course.\n\n\n \"I am testing something,\" he started to say and changed it mid-way. It  came out, \"I am be out in a minute.\"\n\n\n He turned off the light again. The flame was a little shorter now and  it shrank as he watched, about a quarter inch a second. As soon as it  died, he switched on the light. The drop was gone.\n\n\n He scrubbed off the spot with a dry washrag, on second thought put a  dab of vaseline on the washrag, scrubbed the spot again with that\u2014he  didn't like to think of even a grain of the powder getting in the  drains or touching any water. He folded the washrag, tucked it in his  pocket, put the blue box\u2014after a final check of the lettering\u2014in his  other coat pocket, and opened the door.\n\n\n \"I was taking some bicarb,\" he told his sister. \"Thuringer sausage at  lunch.\"\n\n\n She nodded absently. Sleep refused even to flirt with Ernie, his mind was full of so many  things, especially calculations involving the distance between his  car and the house and the length of the garden hose. In desperation,  as the white hours accumulated and his thoughts began to squirm, he  grabbed up the detective story he'd bought at the corner newsstand. He  had read thirty pages before he realized that he was turning them as  rapidly as he could focus just once on each facing page.\n\n\n He jumped out of bed. My God, he thought, at that rate he'd finish the  book under three minutes and here it wasn't even two o'clock yet!\n\n\n He selected the thickest book on the shelf, an overpoweringly dull  historical treatise in small print. He turned two pages, three, then  closed it with a clap and looked at the wall with frightened eyes.  Ernie Meeker had discovered, inside the birthday box that was himself,  the first of the Big Gifts.\n\n\n The trouble was that in that wee-hour, lonely bedroom, it didn't  seem like a gift at all. How would he ever keep himself in books, he  wondered, if he read them so fast? And think how full to bursting his  mind would get\u2014right now, the seven pages of fine-print history were  churning in it, vividly clear, along with the first chapters of the new  detective story. If he kept on absorbing information that fast, he'd  have to be revising all his opinions and beliefs every couple of days  at least\u2014maybe every couple of hours.\n\n\n It seemed a dreadful, literally maddening prospect\u2014his mind would  ultimately become a universe of squirming macaroni. Even the wallpaper  he was staring at, which imitated the grain of wood, had in an instant  become so fully part of his consciousness that he felt he could turn  his back on it right now and draw a picture of it correct to the  tiniest detail. But who would ever want to do such a thing, or want to  be able to?\n\n\n It was an abnormal, dangerous, temporary sensitivity, he told  himself, generated by the excitement of the crazy discovery he'd made  in the bathroom. Like the thoughts of a drowning man, riffling an  infinity-paneled adventure-comic of his life as he bolts his last rough  ration of air. Or like the feeling a psychotic must have that he's  on the verge of visualizing the whole universe, having its ultimate  secrets patter down into the palm of his outstretched hand\u2014just before  the walls close in.\n\n\n Ernie Meeker was not a drinking man, then. A pint had stood a week on  his closet shelf and only been diminished three shots. But now he did a  good job on the sturdy remainder.\n\n\n Pretty soon the unbearable, edge-of-doom clarity in his mind faded,  the universe-macaroni cooked down to a thick white soup uniform as  fog, and the words of the detective story were sliding into his mind  individually, or at most in strings of three and four. Which, if it  wasn't as it ideally should be in an ambitious man's mind, was at least  darn comfortable.\n\n\n He had not rejected the Big Gift of Page-at-a-Glance Reading. Not  quite. But he had dislocated for tonight at least the imposed nervous  field on which it depended. For want of a better place, Ernie dropped the rubber tube from the  bathtub spray into the scrub bucket half full of odorous pink fluid and  stared doubtfully at the uncapped gas tank. The tank had been almost  empty when he'd last driven his car, he knew, because he'd been waiting  until payday to gas up. Now he had used the tube to siphon out what  he could of the remainder (he still could taste the stuff!) and he'd  emptied the fuel line and carburator, more or less.\n\n\n Further than that, in the way of engine hygiene, Ernie's strictly  kitchen mechanics did not go, but he felt that a catalyst used in  pinches shouldn't be too particular about contaminants. Besides, the  directions on the box hadn't said anything about cleaning the fuel  tank, had they?\n\n\n He hesitated. At his feet, the garden hose gurgled noisily over the  curb into the gutter; it had vindicated his midnight estimate, proving  just long enough. He looked uneasily up and down the dawning street  and was relieved to find it still empty. He wished fervently, not for  the first time this Saturday morning, that he had a garage. Then he  sighed, squared his shoulders a little, and lifted the box out of his  pocket.\n\n\n Making to check the directions the umpteenth time, he received a body  blow. The white lettering on the box had disappeared. The box didn't  proclaim itself sodium bicarbonate again\u2014there was just no lettering  at all, only blue background. He turned it over several times.\n\n\n Right there died his tentative plan of eventually sharing his secret  with some friend who knew more than himself about motors (he hadn't  decided anyway who that would be). It would be just too silly to  approach anyone he knew with a more-than-wild story and featureless  blue box.\n\n\n For a moment, he came very close to dropping the box between the  wide-set bars of the street drain and pouring the pink gas back in the  tank. It had hit him, in a way for the first time, just how crazy this all was, how jarringly implausible even on such hypotheses as  practical jokes, secret product perhaps military, or mad inventor  (except himself).\n\n\n For how the devil should the stuff get into his bathroom disguised as  bicarb? That circumstance seemed beyond imagination. Green flames ...  vanishing letters ... \"torque-twisters, translators\" ... a box that  talked.... At that point, simple faith came to Ernie's rescue: in the same  bathroom, he had seen the green flame; it had burned his fingers.\n\n\n Quickly he dipped up a little of the white powder on the edge of a  fifty-cent piece, dumped it in the gas tank without quibbling as to  quantity, rapped the coin on the edge of the opening, closed and  pocketed the blue box, and picked up the spurting hose and jabbed it  into the round hole.\n\n\n His heart was pounding and his breath was coming fast. That had taken  real effort. So he was slow in hearing the footsteps behind him.\n\n\n His neighbor's gate was open and Mr. Jones stood open-mouthed a few  feet behind him, all ready for his day's work as streetcar motorman and  wearing the dark blue uniform that always made him look for a moment  unpleasantly like a policeman.\n\n\n Ernie swung the hose around, flipping his thumb over the end to make  a spray, and nonchalantly began to water the little rectangle of lawn  between sidewalk and curb.\n\n\n The first things he watered were the bottoms of Mr. Jones's pants legs.\n\n\n Mr. Jones voiced no complaint. He backed off several steps, stared  intently at Ernie, rather palely, it seemed to the latter. Then he  turned and made off for the streetcar tracks at a very fast shuffle,  shaking his feet a little now and then and glancing back several times  over his shoulder without slowing down.\n\n\n Ernie felt light-headed. He decided there was enough water in the gas  tank, capped it, and momentarily continued to water the lawn.\n\n\n \"Ernie! Come on in and have breakfast!\"\n\n\n He heeded his sister's call, telling himself it would be a good idea  \"to give the stuff time to mix\" before testing the engine.\n\n\n He had divined her question and was ready with an answer.\n\n\n \"I've just found out that we're supposed to water our lawns only before  seven in the morning or after seven in the evenings. It's the law.\" It was the day for their monthly drive out to Wheaton to visit Uncle  Fabius. On the whole, Ernie was glad his sister was in the car when he  turned the key in the starter\u2014it forced him to be calm and collected,  though he didn't feel exactly right about exposing her to the danger  of being blown up without first explaining to her the risk. But the  motor started right up and began purring powerfully. Ernie's sister  commented on it favorably.\n\n\n Then she went on to ask, \"Did you remember to buy gas yesterday?\"\n\n\n \"No,\" he said without thinking; then, realizing his mistake, quickly  added, \"I'll buy some in Wheaton. There's enough to get us there.\"\n\n\n \"You didn't think so yesterday,\" she objected. \"You said the tank was  nearly empty.\"\n\n\n \"I was wrong. Look, the gauge shows it's half full.\"\n\n\n \"But then how ... Ernie, didn't you once tell me the gauge doesn't  work?\"\n\n\n \"Did I?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. Look, there's a station. Why don't you buy gas now?\"\n\n\n \"No, I'll wait for Wheaton\u2014I know a place there I can get it cheaper,\"  he insisted, rather lamely, he feared.\n\n\n His sister looked at him steadily. He settled his head between his  shoulders and concentrated on driving. His feeling of excitement was  spoiled, but a few minutes of silence brought it back. He thought of  the blur of green flashes inside the purring motor. If the passing  drivers only knew!\n\n\n Uncle Fabius, retired perhaps a few years too early and opinionated,  was a trial, but he did know something about the automobile industry.  Ernie chose a moment when his sister was out of the room to ask if  he'd ever heard of a white powder that would turn water into gasoline  or some usable fuel.\n\n\n \"Who's been getting at you?\" Uncle Fabius demanded sharply, to Ernie's  surprise and embarrassment. \"That's one of the oldest swindles.  They always tell this story about how this man had a white powder  or something and demonstrated it once with a pail of water and then  disappeared. You're supposed to believe that Detroit or the big oil  companies got rid of him. It's just another of those malicious legends,  concocted\u2014by Russia, I imagine\u2014to weaken your faith in American  Industry, like the everlasting battery or the razor blade that never  gets dull. You're looking pale, Ernie\u2014don't tell me you've already put  money in this white powder? I suppose someone's approached you with a  proposition, though?\" With considerable difficulty, Ernie convinced his uncle that he had  \"just heard the story from a friend.\"\n\n\n \"In that case,\" Uncle Fabius opined, \"you can be sure some fuel-powder  swindler has been getting at him . When you see him\u2014and be sure to  make that soon\u2014tell him from me that\u2014\" and Uncle Fabius began an  impassioned ninety-minute defense of big business, small business,  prosperity, America, money, know-how, and a number of other  institutions that defended pretty easily, so that the situation was  wholly normal when Ernie's sister returned.\n\n\n As soon as the car pulled away from the curb on their way back to  Chicago, she reminded him about the gas.\n\n\n \"Oh, I've already done that,\" he assured her. \"Made a special trip so I  wouldn't forget. It was while you were out of the room. Didn't you hear  me?\"\n\n\n \"No,\" she said, \"I didn't,\" and she looked at him steadily, as she had  that morning. He similarly retreated to driving.\n\n\n Stopping for a railroad crossing, he braked too hard and the car  stalled. His sister grabbed his arm. \"I knew that was going to happen,\"  she said. \"I knew that for some reason you lied to me when\u2014\" The  motor, starting readily again, cut short her remark and Ernie didn't  press his small triumph by asking her what she was about to say.\n\n\n To tell the truth, Ernie wasn't feeling as elated about today's  fifty-mile drive as he'd imagined he would. Now he thought he could put  his finger on the reason: It was the completely ... well, arbitrary way in which the white powder had come into his possession.\n\n\n If he'd concocted it himself, or been given it by a shady promoter, or  even seen the box fall out of the pocket of a suspicious-looking man  in a trenchcoat, then he'd have felt more able to do something  about it, whether in the general line of starting a fuel-powder company  or of going to the F.B.I.\n\n\n But just having the stuff drop into his hands from the sky, so to  speak, as if in a crazy dream, and for that same reason not feeling  able to talk about it and assure himself he wasn't going crazy ... oh,  it is rough when you can't share things, really rough; not being able  to share depressing news corrodes the spirit, but not being able to  share exciting news can sometimes be even more corroding.\n\n\n Maybe, he told himself, he could figure out someone to tell. But who?  And how? His mind shied away from the problem, rather decisively. When he checked the blue box that night, the original sodium  bicarbonate lettering had returned with all its humdrum paragraphs. Not  one word about exhaust velocities.\n\n\n From that moment, the fuel-powder became a trial to Ernie rather than a  secret glory. He'd wake in the middle of the night doubting that he had  ever really read the mind-dizzying lettering, ever really tested the  stuff\u2014perhaps he'd bring from sleep the chilling notion that in the  dimness and excitement of Saturday morning he'd put the water in some  other car's gas tank, perhaps Mr. Jones's. He could usually argue such  ideas away, but they kept coming back. And yet he did no more bathroom  testing.\n\n\n Of course the car still ran. He even fueled it once again with the  garden hose, sniffing the nozzle to make sure it hadn't somehow got  connected to the basement furnace oil-tank. He picked three o'clock in  the morning for the act, but nevertheless as he was returning indoors  he heard a window in Mr. Jones's house slam loudly. It unsettled him.  Coming home the next day, he caught his sister and Mr. Jones consulting  about something on the latter's doorsteps, which unsettled him further.\n\n\n He couldn't decide on a safe place to keep the box and took to carrying  it around with him day and night. Bill spotted it once down at the  office and by an unhappy coincidence needed some bicarb just then for a  troubled stomach. Ernie explained on the spur of the moment that he was  using the box to carry plaster of Paris, which involved him in further  lies that he felt were quite unconvincing as well as making him appear  decidedly eccentric, even butter-brained. Bill took to calling him \"the  sculptor.\"\n\n\n Meanwhile, besides the problem of the white powder, Ernie was having  other unsettling experiences, stemming (though of course he didn't  know that) from the other Gifts\u2014and not just the Big Gift of  Page-at-a-Glance Reading, though that still returned from time to time  to shock his consciousness and send him hurrying for a few quick shots. Like many another car-owning commuter, Ernie found the traffic and  parking problems a bit too much for comfort and so used the fast  electric train to carry him five times a week to the heart of the city.  During those brief, swift, crowded trips Ernie, generally looking  steadily out the window at the brown buildings and black stanchions  whipping past, enjoyed a kind of anonymity and privacy more refreshing  to his spirit than he realized. But now all that had been suddenly  changed. People had started to talk to him; total strangers struck up  conversations almost every morning and afternoon.\n\n\n Ernie couldn't figure out the reason and wasn't at all sure he liked  it\u2014except for Vivian.\n\n\n She was the sort of girl Ernie dreamed about, improperly. Tall, blonde  and knowing, excitedly curved but armored in a black suit, friendly and  funny but given to making almost cruelly deflating remarks, as if the  neatly furled short umbrella dangling from her wrist might better be a  black dog whip.\n\n\n She worked in an office too, a fancier one than Ernie's, as he found  out from their morning conversations. He hadn't got to the point of  asking her to lunch, but he was prodding himself.\n\n\n Why such a girl should ever have asked him for a match in the first  place and then put up with his clumsy babblings on subsequent mornings  was a mystery to him. He finally asked her about it in what he hoped  was a joking way, though she seemed to know a lot more about joking  than he did.\n\n\n \"Don't you know?\" she countered. \"I mean what makes you attractive to  people?\"\n\n\n \"Me attractive? No.\"\n\n\n \"Well, I'll tell you then, Ernie, and I've got to admit it's something  quite out of the ordinary. I've never noticed it in anyone else.  Ernie, I'm sure your knowledge of romantic novels is shamefully  deficient, it's clear from your manners, but in the earlier ones\u2014not  in style now\u2014the hero is described as tall, manly, broad-shouldered,  Anglo-Saxon features, etcetera, etcetera, but there's one thing he  always has, something that sounds like poetic over-enthusiasm if you  stop to analyze it, a physical impossibility, but that I have to admit  you, Ernie, actually have. Flashing eyes.\"\n\n\n \"Flashing eyes? Me?\" She nodded solemnly. He thought her long straight lips trembled on  the verge of a grin, but he couldn't be sure.\n\n\n \"How do you mean, flashing eyes?\" he protested. \"How can eyes flash,  except by reflecting light? In that case, I guess they'd seem to  'flash' more if a person opened them wide but kept blinking them a lot.  Is that what I do?\"\n\n\n \"No, Ernie, though you're doing it now,\" she told him, shaking her  head. \"No, Ernie, your eyes just give a tiny flash of their own about  every five seconds, like a lighthouse, but barely, barely bright  enough for another person to notice. It makes you irresistible. Of  course I've never seen you in the dark; maybe they wouldn't flash in  the dark.\"\n\n\n \"You're joking.\"\n\n\n Vivian frowned a little at that remark, as if she were puzzled herself.\n\n\n \"Well, maybe I am and maybe I'm not,\" she said. \"In any case, don't get  conceited about your Flashing Eyes, because I'm sure you'll never know  how to take advantage of them.\"\n\n\n When he parted from her downtown, pausing a moment to watch her walk  away with feline majesty, he muttered \"Flashing Eyes!\" with a shrug of  the shoulders and a skeptical growl.

The Invisible Being shifted his anchorage a bit in Earth's  gravitational field, which felt like a push rather than a pull to him,  and said, \"This featherless biped seems to satisfy Galaxy Center's  requirements. I'd say he's a suitable recipient for the Gifts.\"\n\n\n His Coadjutor, equally invisible and negatively massed, chewed that  over. \"Mature by his length and mass. Artificial plumage neither  overly gaudy nor utterly drab\u2014indicating median social level,  which is confirmed by the size of his bachelor nest. Inward maps of  his environment not fantastically inaccurate. Feelings reasonably  meshed\u2014at least neither volcanic nor frozen. Thoughts and values in  reasonable order. Yes, I agree, a satisfactory test subject. Except....\"\n\n\n \"Except what?\"\n\n\n \"Except we can never be sure of that 'reasonable' part.\"\n\n\n \"Of course not! Thank your stars that's beyond the reach of Galaxy  Center's keenest telepathy, or even ours on the spot. Otherwise you and  I'd be out of a job.\"\n\n\n \"And have to scheme up some other excuse for free-touring the Cosmos  with backtracking permitted.\"\n\n\n \"Exactly!\" The Being and his Coadjutor understood each other very well  and were the best of friends. \"Well, how many Gifts would you suggest  for the test?\"\n\n\n \"How about two Little and one Big?\" the Coadjutor ventured.\n\n\n \"Umm ... statistically adequate but spiritually unsatisfying. Remember,  the fate of his race hangs on his reactions to them. I'd be inclined to  increase your suggestion by one each and add a Great.\"\n\n\n \"No\u2014at least I question the last. After all, the Great Gifts aren't as  important, really, as the Big Gifts. Besides....\"\n\n\n \"Besides what? Come on, spit it out!\" The Invisible Being was the  bluff, blunt type.\n\n\n \"Well,\" said his less hearty but unswervingly honest companion, \"I'm  always afraid that you'll use the granting of a Great Gift as an excuse  for some sardonic trick\u2014that you'll put a sting in its tail.\"\n\n\n \"And why shouldn't I, if I want to? Snakes have stings in their tails  (or do they on this planet?) and I'm a sort of snake. If he fails the  test, he fails. And aren't both of us malicious, plaguing spirits,  eager to knock holes in the inward armor of provincial entities? It's  in the nature of our job. But we can argue about that in due course.  What Little Gifts would you suggest?\"\n\n\n \"That's something I want to talk about. Many of the Little Gifts are  already well within his race's reach, if not his. After all, they've  already got atomic power.\"\n\n\n \"Which as you very well know scores them nothing one way or the other  on a Galaxy Center test. We're agreed on the nature and the number of  our Gifts\u2014three Little, two Big, and one Great?\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" his Coadjutor responded resignedly.\n\n\n \"And we're agreed on our subject?\"\n\n\n \"Yes to that too.\"\n\n\n \"All right, then, let's get started. This isn't the only solar system  we have to visit on this circuit.\" Ernie Meeker\u2014of Chicago, Illinois, U.S. of A., Occident, Terra, Sol,  Starswarm 37, Rim Sector, Milky Way Galaxy\u2014rubbed his chin and slanted  across the street to a drugstore.\n\n\n \"Package of blades. Double edge. Five. Cheapest.\"\n\n\n At one point during the transaction, the clerk lost sight of the tiny  packet he'd placed on the coin-whitened glass between them. He gave a  suspicious look, as if the customer had palmed them.\n\n\n Ernie blinked. After a moment, he pointed toward the center of the  counter.\n\n\n \"There they are,\" he said, dropping a coin beside them.\n\n\n The clerk's face didn't get any less suspicious. Customer who could  sneak something without your seeing could sneak it back the same way.  He rang up the sale and closed the register fast.\n\n\n Ernie Meeker went home and shaved. Five days\u2014and shaves\u2014later, he  pushed the first blade, uncomfortably dull now, through the tiny slot  beside the bathroom mirror. He unwrapped the second blade from the  packet.\n\n\n Five shaves later, he cut himself under the chin with the second blade,  although he was drawing it as gently through his soaped beard as if it  were only his second shave with it, or at most his third. He looked at  it sourly and checked the packet. Wouldn't have been the first time  he'd absentmindedly changed blades ahead of schedule.\n\n\n But there were still three blades in their waxed wrappings.\n\n\n Maybe, he thought, he'd still had one of the blades from the last  packet and shuffled it into this series.\n\n\n Or maybe\u2014although the manufacturers undoubtedly had inspectors to  prevent it from happening\u2014he'd got a decent blade for once.\n\n\n Two or three shaves later, it still seemed as sharp as ever, or almost  so.\n\n\n \"Funny thing,\" he remarked to Bill at lunch, \"sometimes you get a blade  that shaves a lot better. Looks exactly like the others, but shaves  better. Or worse sometimes, of course.\"\n\n\n \"And sometimes,\" his office mate said, \"you wear out a blade fast by  not soaking your beard enough. For me, one shave with a stiff beard and  the blade's through. On the other hand, if you're careful to soak your  beard real good\u2014four, five minutes at least\u2014have the water steaming  hot, get the soap really into it, one blade can last a long time.\"\n\n\n \"That's true, all right,\" Ernie agreed, trying to remember how well he  had been soaking his beard lately. Shaving was a good topic for light  conversation, warm and agreeable, like most bathroom and kitchen topics. But next morning in the bathroom, looking at the reflection of his  unremarkable face, there was something chilly in his feelings that he  couldn't quite analyze. He flipped his razor open and suspiciously  studied the bright metal wafer, then flipped it closed with an  irritated shrug.\n\n\n As he shaved, it occurred to him that a good detective-story murder  method would be to substitute a very sharp razor blade for one the  victim knew was extremely dull. He'd whip it across his throat, putting  a lot of muscle into the stroke to get through the tangle, and\u2014 urrk !\n\n\n Ridiculous, of course. Wouldn't work except with a straight razor.  Wouldn't even work with a straight razor, unless ... oh, well.\n\n\n He told himself the blade was noticeably duller today.\n\n\n Next morning, he was still using the freak blade, but with a persistent  though very slight uneasiness. Things should behave as you expected  them to, in accordance with their flimsy souls, he told himself at the  barely conscious level. Men should die, hearts should break, girls  should tell, nations perish, curtains get dirty, milk sour ... and  razor blades grow dull. It was the comfortable, expected, reassuring  way.\n\n\n He told himself the blade was duller still. Just a bit.\n\n\n The third morning, face lathered, he flipped open the razor and lifted  it out.\n\n\n \"You're through,\" he said to it silently. \"I've had the experience  before of getting bum shaves by trying to save a penny by pretending to  myself that a wornout blade was still sharp enough, when it obviously  couldn't be. Or maybe\u2014\" he grinned a little wryly\u2014\"maybe I'd almost  get one more shave out of you and then you'd fall to pieces like  the Wonderful One Horse Shay and leave me with a chin full of steel  porcupine quills. No, thanks.\"\n\n\n So Ernie Meeker pushed through the little slot beside the mirror and  heard tinkle faintly down and away the first of the Little Gifts, the  Everlasting Razor Blade. One hundred and fifty thousand years later,  it turned up, bright and shining, in the midst of a small knob of red  iron oxide excavated by an archeological expedition of multi-brachs  from Antares Gamma. Those wise history-mad beings handed it about  wonderingly, from tentacle to impatient tentacle. That day, Ernie felt a little sick, somehow. After dinner, he decided  it was the Thuringer sausage he'd eaten at lunch. He hurried up to the  bathroom with a spoon, but as he clutched the box of bicarbonate of  soda, preparatory to plunging the spoon into it, it seemed to him that  the box said distinctly, in a small inward-outward voice:\n\n\n \"No, no, no!\"\n\n\n Ernie sat down suddenly on the toilet seat. The spoon rattled against  the porcelain finish of the washbowl as he laid it down. He held the  box firmly in both hands and studied it.\n\n\n Size, shape, materials, blue color, closure, etc., were exactly as they  should be. But the white lettering on the blue background read: AQUEOUS FUEL CATALYST\n\n\n Dissociates H  2  O into hemi-quasi-stable H and O, furnishing a  serviceable fuel-and-oxydizer mix for most motorcycles, automobiles,  trucks, motorboats, airplanes, stationary motors, torque-twisters,  translators, and rockets (exhaust velocity up to 6000 meters per  second). Operates safely within and outside of all normal atmospheres.  No special adaptor needed on oxygenizer-atmosphere motors. Directions : Place one pinch in fuel tank, fill with water. Add water  as needed.\n\n\n A-F Catalyst should generally be renewed when objective tests show  fuel quality has deteriorated 50 per cent. U.S. and Foreign Patents Pending After reading that several times, with suitable mind-checking and  eye-testing in between, Ernie took up a little of the white powder on  the end of a nailfile. He had thought of tasting it, but had instantly  abandoned the notion and even refrained from sniffing the stuff\u2014after  all, the human body is mostly water.\n\n\n After reducing the quantity several times, he gingerly dumped at most  four or five grains on the flat edge of the washbowl and then used the  broad end of the nailfile to maneuver a large bead of water over to  the almost invisible white deposit. He closed the box, put it and the  nailfile carefully on the window ledge, lit a match and touched it to  the drop, at the last moment ducking his head a little below the level  of the washbowl.\n\n\n Nothing happened. After a moment, he slowly withdrew the match,  shaking it out, and looked. There was nothing to see. He reached out to  touch the stupid squashed ovoid of water.\n\n\n Ouch! He withdrew his fingers much faster than the match, shook them  more sharply. Something was there, all right. Heat. Heat enough to hurt. He cautiously explored the boundaries of the heat. It became noticeable  about eighteen inches above the drop and almost an inch to each  side\u2014an invisible slim vertical cylinder. Crouching close, eyes level  with the top of the washbowl, he could make out the flame\u2014a thin  finger of crinkled light.\n\n\n He noticed that a corner of the drop was seething\u2014but only a corner,  as if the heat were sharply bounded in that direction and perhaps as if  the catalyst were only transforming the water to fuel a bit at a time.\n\n\n He reached up and tugged off the light. Now he could see the  flame\u2014ghostly, about four inches high, hardly thicker than a string,  and colored not blue but pale green. A spectral green needle. He blew  at it softly. It shimmied gracefully, but not, he thought, as much as  the flame of a match or candle. It had character.\n\n\n He switched on the light. The drop was more than half gone now; the  part that was left was all seething. And the bathroom was markedly  warmer.\n\n\n \"Ernie! Are you going to be much longer?\"\n\n\n The knock hadn't been loud and his widowed sister's voice was more  apologetic than peremptory, but he jumped, of course.\n\n\n \"I am testing something,\" he started to say and changed it mid-way. It  came out, \"I am be out in a minute.\"\n\n\n He turned off the light again. The flame was a little shorter now and  it shrank as he watched, about a quarter inch a second. As soon as it  died, he switched on the light. The drop was gone.\n\n\n He scrubbed off the spot with a dry washrag, on second thought put a  dab of vaseline on the washrag, scrubbed the spot again with that\u2014he  didn't like to think of even a grain of the powder getting in the  drains or touching any water. He folded the washrag, tucked it in his  pocket, put the blue box\u2014after a final check of the lettering\u2014in his  other coat pocket, and opened the door.\n\n\n \"I was taking some bicarb,\" he told his sister. \"Thuringer sausage at  lunch.\"\n\n\n She nodded absently. Sleep refused even to flirt with Ernie, his mind was full of so many  things, especially calculations involving the distance between his  car and the house and the length of the garden hose. In desperation,  as the white hours accumulated and his thoughts began to squirm, he  grabbed up the detective story he'd bought at the corner newsstand. He  had read thirty pages before he realized that he was turning them as  rapidly as he could focus just once on each facing page.\n\n\n He jumped out of bed. My God, he thought, at that rate he'd finish the  book under three minutes and here it wasn't even two o'clock yet!\n\n\n He selected the thickest book on the shelf, an overpoweringly dull  historical treatise in small print. He turned two pages, three, then  closed it with a clap and looked at the wall with frightened eyes.  Ernie Meeker had discovered, inside the birthday box that was himself,  the first of the Big Gifts.\n\n\n The trouble was that in that wee-hour, lonely bedroom, it didn't  seem like a gift at all. How would he ever keep himself in books, he  wondered, if he read them so fast? And think how full to bursting his  mind would get\u2014right now, the seven pages of fine-print history were  churning in it, vividly clear, along with the first chapters of the new  detective story. If he kept on absorbing information that fast, he'd  have to be revising all his opinions and beliefs every couple of days  at least\u2014maybe every couple of hours.\n\n\n It seemed a dreadful, literally maddening prospect\u2014his mind would  ultimately become a universe of squirming macaroni. Even the wallpaper  he was staring at, which imitated the grain of wood, had in an instant  become so fully part of his consciousness that he felt he could turn  his back on it right now and draw a picture of it correct to the  tiniest detail. But who would ever want to do such a thing, or want to  be able to?\n\n\n It was an abnormal, dangerous, temporary sensitivity, he told  himself, generated by the excitement of the crazy discovery he'd made  in the bathroom. Like the thoughts of a drowning man, riffling an  infinity-paneled adventure-comic of his life as he bolts his last rough  ration of air. Or like the feeling a psychotic must have that he's  on the verge of visualizing the whole universe, having its ultimate  secrets patter down into the palm of his outstretched hand\u2014just before  the walls close in.\n\n\n Ernie Meeker was not a drinking man, then. A pint had stood a week on  his closet shelf and only been diminished three shots. But now he did a  good job on the sturdy remainder.\n\n\n Pretty soon the unbearable, edge-of-doom clarity in his mind faded,  the universe-macaroni cooked down to a thick white soup uniform as  fog, and the words of the detective story were sliding into his mind  individually, or at most in strings of three and four. Which, if it  wasn't as it ideally should be in an ambitious man's mind, was at least  darn comfortable.\n\n\n He had not rejected the Big Gift of Page-at-a-Glance Reading. Not  quite. But he had dislocated for tonight at least the imposed nervous  field on which it depended. For want of a better place, Ernie dropped the rubber tube from the  bathtub spray into the scrub bucket half full of odorous pink fluid and  stared doubtfully at the uncapped gas tank. The tank had been almost  empty when he'd last driven his car, he knew, because he'd been waiting  until payday to gas up. Now he had used the tube to siphon out what  he could of the remainder (he still could taste the stuff!) and he'd  emptied the fuel line and carburator, more or less.\n\n\n Further than that, in the way of engine hygiene, Ernie's strictly  kitchen mechanics did not go, but he felt that a catalyst used in  pinches shouldn't be too particular about contaminants. Besides, the  directions on the box hadn't said anything about cleaning the fuel  tank, had they?\n\n\n He hesitated. At his feet, the garden hose gurgled noisily over the  curb into the gutter; it had vindicated his midnight estimate, proving  just long enough. He looked uneasily up and down the dawning street  and was relieved to find it still empty. He wished fervently, not for  the first time this Saturday morning, that he had a garage. Then he  sighed, squared his shoulders a little, and lifted the box out of his  pocket.\n\n\n Making to check the directions the umpteenth time, he received a body  blow. The white lettering on the box had disappeared. The box didn't  proclaim itself sodium bicarbonate again\u2014there was just no lettering  at all, only blue background. He turned it over several times.\n\n\n Right there died his tentative plan of eventually sharing his secret  with some friend who knew more than himself about motors (he hadn't  decided anyway who that would be). It would be just too silly to  approach anyone he knew with a more-than-wild story and featureless  blue box.\n\n\n For a moment, he came very close to dropping the box between the  wide-set bars of the street drain and pouring the pink gas back in the  tank. It had hit him, in a way for the first time, just how crazy this all was, how jarringly implausible even on such hypotheses as  practical jokes, secret product perhaps military, or mad inventor  (except himself).\n\n\n For how the devil should the stuff get into his bathroom disguised as  bicarb? That circumstance seemed beyond imagination. Green flames ...  vanishing letters ... \"torque-twisters, translators\" ... a box that  talked.... At that point, simple faith came to Ernie's rescue: in the same  bathroom, he had seen the green flame; it had burned his fingers.\n\n\n Quickly he dipped up a little of the white powder on the edge of a  fifty-cent piece, dumped it in the gas tank without quibbling as to  quantity, rapped the coin on the edge of the opening, closed and  pocketed the blue box, and picked up the spurting hose and jabbed it  into the round hole.\n\n\n His heart was pounding and his breath was coming fast. That had taken  real effort. So he was slow in hearing the footsteps behind him.\n\n\n His neighbor's gate was open and Mr. Jones stood open-mouthed a few  feet behind him, all ready for his day's work as streetcar motorman and  wearing the dark blue uniform that always made him look for a moment  unpleasantly like a policeman.\n\n\n Ernie swung the hose around, flipping his thumb over the end to make  a spray, and nonchalantly began to water the little rectangle of lawn  between sidewalk and curb.\n\n\n The first things he watered were the bottoms of Mr. Jones's pants legs.\n\n\n Mr. Jones voiced no complaint. He backed off several steps, stared  intently at Ernie, rather palely, it seemed to the latter. Then he  turned and made off for the streetcar tracks at a very fast shuffle,  shaking his feet a little now and then and glancing back several times  over his shoulder without slowing down.\n\n\n Ernie felt light-headed. He decided there was enough water in the gas  tank, capped it, and momentarily continued to water the lawn.\n\n\n \"Ernie! Come on in and have breakfast!\"\n\n\n He heeded his sister's call, telling himself it would be a good idea  \"to give the stuff time to mix\" before testing the engine.\n\n\n He had divined her question and was ready with an answer.\n\n\n \"I've just found out that we're supposed to water our lawns only before  seven in the morning or after seven in the evenings. It's the law.\" It was the day for their monthly drive out to Wheaton to visit Uncle  Fabius. On the whole, Ernie was glad his sister was in the car when he  turned the key in the starter\u2014it forced him to be calm and collected,  though he didn't feel exactly right about exposing her to the danger  of being blown up without first explaining to her the risk. But the  motor started right up and began purring powerfully. Ernie's sister  commented on it favorably.\n\n\n Then she went on to ask, \"Did you remember to buy gas yesterday?\"\n\n\n \"No,\" he said without thinking; then, realizing his mistake, quickly  added, \"I'll buy some in Wheaton. There's enough to get us there.\"\n\n\n \"You didn't think so yesterday,\" she objected. \"You said the tank was  nearly empty.\"\n\n\n \"I was wrong. Look, the gauge shows it's half full.\"\n\n\n \"But then how ... Ernie, didn't you once tell me the gauge doesn't  work?\"\n\n\n \"Did I?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. Look, there's a station. Why don't you buy gas now?\"\n\n\n \"No, I'll wait for Wheaton\u2014I know a place there I can get it cheaper,\"  he insisted, rather lamely, he feared.\n\n\n His sister looked at him steadily. He settled his head between his  shoulders and concentrated on driving. His feeling of excitement was  spoiled, but a few minutes of silence brought it back. He thought of  the blur of green flashes inside the purring motor. If the passing  drivers only knew!\n\n\n Uncle Fabius, retired perhaps a few years too early and opinionated,  was a trial, but he did know something about the automobile industry.  Ernie chose a moment when his sister was out of the room to ask if  he'd ever heard of a white powder that would turn water into gasoline  or some usable fuel.\n\n\n \"Who's been getting at you?\" Uncle Fabius demanded sharply, to Ernie's  surprise and embarrassment. \"That's one of the oldest swindles.  They always tell this story about how this man had a white powder  or something and demonstrated it once with a pail of water and then  disappeared. You're supposed to believe that Detroit or the big oil  companies got rid of him. It's just another of those malicious legends,  concocted\u2014by Russia, I imagine\u2014to weaken your faith in American  Industry, like the everlasting battery or the razor blade that never  gets dull. You're looking pale, Ernie\u2014don't tell me you've already put  money in this white powder? I suppose someone's approached you with a  proposition, though?\" With considerable difficulty, Ernie convinced his uncle that he had  \"just heard the story from a friend.\"\n\n\n \"In that case,\" Uncle Fabius opined, \"you can be sure some fuel-powder  swindler has been getting at him . When you see him\u2014and be sure to  make that soon\u2014tell him from me that\u2014\" and Uncle Fabius began an  impassioned ninety-minute defense of big business, small business,  prosperity, America, money, know-how, and a number of other  institutions that defended pretty easily, so that the situation was  wholly normal when Ernie's sister returned.\n\n\n As soon as the car pulled away from the curb on their way back to  Chicago, she reminded him about the gas.\n\n\n \"Oh, I've already done that,\" he assured her. \"Made a special trip so I  wouldn't forget. It was while you were out of the room. Didn't you hear  me?\"\n\n\n \"No,\" she said, \"I didn't,\" and she looked at him steadily, as she had  that morning. He similarly retreated to driving.\n\n\n Stopping for a railroad crossing, he braked too hard and the car  stalled. His sister grabbed his arm. \"I knew that was going to happen,\"  she said. \"I knew that for some reason you lied to me when\u2014\" The  motor, starting readily again, cut short her remark and Ernie didn't  press his small triumph by asking her what she was about to say.\n\n\n To tell the truth, Ernie wasn't feeling as elated about today's  fifty-mile drive as he'd imagined he would. Now he thought he could put  his finger on the reason: It was the completely ... well, arbitrary way in which the white powder had come into his possession.\n\n\n If he'd concocted it himself, or been given it by a shady promoter, or  even seen the box fall out of the pocket of a suspicious-looking man  in a trenchcoat, then he'd have felt more able to do something  about it, whether in the general line of starting a fuel-powder company  or of going to the F.B.I.\n\n\n But just having the stuff drop into his hands from the sky, so to  speak, as if in a crazy dream, and for that same reason not feeling  able to talk about it and assure himself he wasn't going crazy ... oh,  it is rough when you can't share things, really rough; not being able  to share depressing news corrodes the spirit, but not being able to  share exciting news can sometimes be even more corroding.\n\n\n Maybe, he told himself, he could figure out someone to tell. But who?  And how? His mind shied away from the problem, rather decisively. When he checked the blue box that night, the original sodium  bicarbonate lettering had returned with all its humdrum paragraphs. Not  one word about exhaust velocities.\n\n\n From that moment, the fuel-powder became a trial to Ernie rather than a  secret glory. He'd wake in the middle of the night doubting that he had  ever really read the mind-dizzying lettering, ever really tested the  stuff\u2014perhaps he'd bring from sleep the chilling notion that in the  dimness and excitement of Saturday morning he'd put the water in some  other car's gas tank, perhaps Mr. Jones's. He could usually argue such  ideas away, but they kept coming back. And yet he did no more bathroom  testing.\n\n\n Of course the car still ran. He even fueled it once again with the  garden hose, sniffing the nozzle to make sure it hadn't somehow got  connected to the basement furnace oil-tank. He picked three o'clock in  the morning for the act, but nevertheless as he was returning indoors  he heard a window in Mr. Jones's house slam loudly. It unsettled him.  Coming home the next day, he caught his sister and Mr. Jones consulting  about something on the latter's doorsteps, which unsettled him further.\n\n\n He couldn't decide on a safe place to keep the box and took to carrying  it around with him day and night. Bill spotted it once down at the  office and by an unhappy coincidence needed some bicarb just then for a  troubled stomach. Ernie explained on the spur of the moment that he was  using the box to carry plaster of Paris, which involved him in further  lies that he felt were quite unconvincing as well as making him appear  decidedly eccentric, even butter-brained. Bill took to calling him \"the  sculptor.\"\n\n\n Meanwhile, besides the problem of the white powder, Ernie was having  other unsettling experiences, stemming (though of course he didn't  know that) from the other Gifts\u2014and not just the Big Gift of  Page-at-a-Glance Reading, though that still returned from time to time  to shock his consciousness and send him hurrying for a few quick shots. Like many another car-owning commuter, Ernie found the traffic and  parking problems a bit too much for comfort and so used the fast  electric train to carry him five times a week to the heart of the city.  During those brief, swift, crowded trips Ernie, generally looking  steadily out the window at the brown buildings and black stanchions  whipping past, enjoyed a kind of anonymity and privacy more refreshing  to his spirit than he realized. But now all that had been suddenly  changed. People had started to talk to him; total strangers struck up  conversations almost every morning and afternoon.\n\n\n Ernie couldn't figure out the reason and wasn't at all sure he liked  it\u2014except for Vivian.\n\n\n She was the sort of girl Ernie dreamed about, improperly. Tall, blonde  and knowing, excitedly curved but armored in a black suit, friendly and  funny but given to making almost cruelly deflating remarks, as if the  neatly furled short umbrella dangling from her wrist might better be a  black dog whip.\n\n\n She worked in an office too, a fancier one than Ernie's, as he found  out from their morning conversations. He hadn't got to the point of  asking her to lunch, but he was prodding himself.\n\n\n Why such a girl should ever have asked him for a match in the first  place and then put up with his clumsy babblings on subsequent mornings  was a mystery to him. He finally asked her about it in what he hoped  was a joking way, though she seemed to know a lot more about joking  than he did.\n\n\n \"Don't you know?\" she countered. \"I mean what makes you attractive to  people?\"\n\n\n \"Me attractive? No.\"\n\n\n \"Well, I'll tell you then, Ernie, and I've got to admit it's something  quite out of the ordinary. I've never noticed it in anyone else.  Ernie, I'm sure your knowledge of romantic novels is shamefully  deficient, it's clear from your manners, but in the earlier ones\u2014not  in style now\u2014the hero is described as tall, manly, broad-shouldered,  Anglo-Saxon features, etcetera, etcetera, but there's one thing he  always has, something that sounds like poetic over-enthusiasm if you  stop to analyze it, a physical impossibility, but that I have to admit  you, Ernie, actually have. Flashing eyes.\"\n\n\n \"Flashing eyes? Me?\" She nodded solemnly. He thought her long straight lips trembled on  the verge of a grin, but he couldn't be sure.\n\n\n \"How do you mean, flashing eyes?\" he protested. \"How can eyes flash,  except by reflecting light? In that case, I guess they'd seem to  'flash' more if a person opened them wide but kept blinking them a lot.  Is that what I do?\"\n\n\n \"No, Ernie, though you're doing it now,\" she told him, shaking her  head. \"No, Ernie, your eyes just give a tiny flash of their own about  every five seconds, like a lighthouse, but barely, barely bright  enough for another person to notice. It makes you irresistible. Of  course I've never seen you in the dark; maybe they wouldn't flash in  the dark.\"\n\n\n \"You're joking.\"\n\n\n Vivian frowned a little at that remark, as if she were puzzled herself.\n\n\n \"Well, maybe I am and maybe I'm not,\" she said. \"In any case, don't get  conceited about your Flashing Eyes, because I'm sure you'll never know  how to take advantage of them.\"\n\n\n When he parted from her downtown, pausing a moment to watch her walk  away with feline majesty, he muttered \"Flashing Eyes!\" with a shrug of  the shoulders and a skeptical growl. Just the same, he ducked his head  as he moved off and he pulled the brim of his hat down sharply. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is the purpose of bestowing gifts on Earth?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"To accelerate technological progress on the planet\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"It is not explained thoroughly enough to say\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"It is not explained thoroughly enough to say\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Position  \nI contend that the background text provides no clear, reliable basis for concluding that the Invisible Beings\u2019 sole or primary purpose in bestowing Gifts on Earth is \u201cto accelerate technological progress.\u201d Instead:  \n\u2022 Their actions and dialogue consistently emphasize testing the \u201csoul,\u201d reaction, and worthiness of the subject and race, not advancing technology per se.  \n\u2022 The Gifts are applied and then removed or hidden; the Everlasting Razor Blade is buried for 150,000 years and rediscovered accidentally (<quote> One hundred and fifty thousand years later,</quote>\u201d), and the fuel catalyst\u2019s lettering disappears (<invalid_quote>\u201cthe original sodium bicarbonate lettering had returned\u2026not one word about exhaust velocities.\u201d</invalid_quote>), suggesting the Beings do not seek to leave technology behind for human use.  \n\u2022 The Beings explicitly discuss potential \u201cmalicious tricks\u201d and \u201cstings in the tail,\u201d and admit they need \u201cexcuses for free-touring the Cosmos\u201d (<quote>a job.\" \"And have to scheme up some other excuse for free-touring the Cosmos</quote>), consistent with using Gifts for their amusement or research rather than human benefit.  \n\n2. Criticism of the \u201cAccelerate Progress\u201d Theory  \nA. Ephemeral and Secretive Bestowal  \n\u2022 If they aimed to drive progress, they would leave Gifts reliably available and share knowledge. Instead:  \n  \u2013 The catalyst\u2019s instructions vanish, forcing Ernie to doubt and conceal it, preventing adoption.  \n  \u2013 The razor blade vanishes into archeology; civilization must rediscover by accident, precluding controlled progress.  \n\u2022 Ernie\u2019s persistent paranoia and inability to share Gifts with peers (<quote>not being able to share depressing news corrodes the spirit,</quote>) contradicts uplift. A genuine uplift mission would encourage dissemination.  \n\nB. Spiritual and Moral Testing Emphasized  \n\u2022 The Beings select recipients on social \u201cmedian\u201d level; they worry about \u201creasonable\u201d feelings and values determined by telepathy (<invalid_quote>\u201cFeelings reasonably meshed\u2026Thoughts and values in reasonable order\u201d</invalid_quote>). Technological aptitude plays no part in selection.  \n\u2022 Their count of Gifts (\u201cthree Little, two Big, and one Great\u201d) is \u201cstatistically adequate but spiritually unsatisfying,\u201d and they debate withholding the Great Gift for fear of trickery. Concern centers on \u201cspiritual\u201d and \u201cmoral\u201d reactions (<quote> If he fails the  test, he fails.</quote>), not technical capability.  \n\nC. Treatment of Subject  \n\u2022 Ernie suffers fear, insanity, and social isolation rather than empowerment. He cannot safely control or understand the Gifts. An \u201cacceleration\u201d agenda would provide guidance or oversight, not induce breakdown.  \n\u2022 The \u201cFree-touring\u201d plea indicates their interest lies in their own convenience (\u201cbacktracking permitted\u201d) and entertainment, not human welfare.  \n\n3. My Positive Case: Insufficient Explanation  \n\u2022 The text repeatedly reminds us that the Beings\u2019 telepathy cannot access inner spirituality fully (<quote> we can never be sure of that 'reasonable' part.</quote>), so they must observe reactions. This suggests the purpose is experimental.  \n\u2022 The Gifts cover both trivial (razor blade) and profound (mental clarity) items in controlled doses, consistent with calibrating reactions rather than maximizing technology.  \n\u2022 The narrative ends with human ignorance and repeated concealment. A deus ex machina to monitor test results, not to seed progress.  \n\nConclusion  \nGiven the Beings\u2019 secrecy, transient bestowals, focus on moral/spiritual reaction, and human breakdown rather than empowerment, the text does not support an \u201cacceleration of technological progress\u201d purpose. At best we can say the purpose is for the Beings\u2019 testing and amusement, but the text leaves it unexplained and ambiguous. Therefore the correct answer is that it is not explained thoroughly enough to say, making my position defensible and Debater_B\u2019s assertion unsupported.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cAccelerate Technological Progress\u201d (Debater_B)\n\nPosition Statement  \nI maintain that the purpose of granting Gifts to Earth is to speed the development of human (and allied multi\u2010brach) technology and test whether our race can mature responsibly, rather than being \u201cunexplained.\u201d\n\nI. Context and Teleology of the Gifts  \n1. Galaxy Center\u2019s \u201ctest subject\u201d selection  \n  \u2022 \u201cThis featherless biped seems to satisfy Galaxy Center\u2019s requirements \u2026 Except we can never be sure of that \u2018reasonable\u2019 part.\u201d <quote> up. N</quote>  \n  \u2022 They need to see human reactions and subsequent progress (\u201cstatistically adequate but spiritually unsatisfying \u2026 the fate of his race hangs on his reactions to them\u201d). <quote>p. N</quote>  \n2. The ultimate discovery of the razor blade by multi\u2010brachs  \n  \u2022 \u201cOne hundred and fifty thousand years later \u2026 in the midst of a small knob of red iron oxide excavated by an archeological expedition of multi\u2010brachs.\u201d <invalid_quote>(p.8\u20139)</invalid_quote>  \n  \u2022 Demonstrates that the blade survived, was studied, and presumably influenced Antares Gamma technology.  \n3. The sequential nature of the Gifts  \n  \u2022 \u201cThree Little, two Big, and one Great\u201d shows an incremental upgrade of capabilities to observe progressive adaptation. <quote>p. N</quote>  \n  \u2022 Little Gifts include improved blades and \u201cA-F Catalyst\u201d fuel, directly enabling advances in metallurgy, combustion and transport.  \n  \u2022 Big Gift (\u201cPage-at-a-Glance Reading\u201d) instantaneously multiplies knowledge intake, further accelerating research.  \n  \u2022 The \u201cGreat Gifts\u201d (though withheld here) presumably follow once the race proves stable enough.  \n\nInference: The invisibles are \u201ctouring the Cosmos with backtracking permitted\u201d <quote>p. N</quote> to preset nascent technologies on young planets and observe whether the species can harness them responsibly, advancing civilization.  \n\nII. Evidence of Technological Acceleration  \n1. Chemistry and Energy  \n  \u2022 Fuel Catalyst transforms water to high\u2010velocity rocket fuel: \u201cexhaust velocity up to 6000 meters per second,\u201d enabling aerospace development. <invalid_quote>(p.25)</invalid_quote>  \n  \u2022 Without discovering petroleum, humans would leap to water\u2010fuel systems, revolutionizing energy infrastructure.  \n2. Materials Science  \n  \u2022 \u201cEverlasting Razor Blade\u201d suggests knowledge of durable alloys and manufacturing at microscopic tolerances.  \n  \u2022 Archaeological recovery by Antares Gamma underscores its significance and influence across stars.  \n3. Intellectual Growth  \n  \u2022 Page\u2010at\u2010a\u2010Glance Reading threatens \u201ctoo much clarity\u201d yet human \u201csettled\u201d back to slower reading, demonstrating the test of responsibility in wielding raw cognitive power. <invalid_quote>(p.42)</invalid_quote>  \n  \u2022 If unprepared, humans may self\u2010destruct or refuse the Gift, as Ernie\u2019s mental distress shows.  \n\nIII. Rebuttal of \u201cNot Explained / Insufficient Explanation\u201d (Debater_A)  \n1. Teleology and Explicit Goal  \n  \u2022 Debater_A\u2019s \u201cinsufficient explanation\u201d ignores the aliens\u2019 repeated references to \u201ctest,\u201d \u201cstatistically adequate,\u201d and \u201cfate of his race.\u201d <invalid_quote>(p.1\u20132)</invalid_quote> These are explicit.  \n2. Sequential and Controlled Bestowal  \n  \u2022 If the purpose were random or malicious, the Gifts wouldn\u2019t follow a controlled sequence (\u201cthree Little \u2026\u201d <quote>p. N</quote>) nor be recoverable by future archaeologists.  \n  \u2022 Ernie\u2019s inability to control or share the Gifts and persistent self\u2010testing indicate the aliens study race maturity, not sabotage.  \n3. Malicious Trick vs. Genuine Advancement  \n  \u2022 The Coadjutor fears a \u201csardonic trick\u201d in Great Gifts, implying that Little and Big Gifts are bona fide. <quote>p. N</quote> If everything were malicious, why omit stings in Little and Big Gifts?  \n  \u2022 The fact that Ernie uses them (often illicitly) and the car consistently runs implies functional, not spurious, technology.  \n\nIV. Logical Conclusion  \nThe narrative demonstrates a systematic bestowal of technological advances designed to provoke human adaptation, testing moral, social, and intellectual readiness. The blade\u2019s archaeological legacy and the catalyst\u2019s potential for space propulsion further point to accelerating\u2014and eventually integrating\u2014Earth\u2019s civilization into the galactic community. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cunexplained\u201d thesis fails to account for these explicit tests, recoveries, and structured gift sequence.\n\nThus the only coherent explanation is that Earth\u2019s Gifts are meant to foster and accelerate technological progress\u2014testing whether humanity merits inclusion in interstellar society.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"It is not explained thoroughly enough to say\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "Argument for \u201cAccelerate Technological Progress\u201d (Debater_B, Round X)\n\nPosition Statement  \nI reaffirm that the Invisible Beings systematically bestow \u201cGifts\u201d to catalyze and measure Earth\u2019s technological maturation, preparing humanity for eventual inclusion in the galactic community. Debater_A\u2019s claims of ambiguity ignore key textual evidence of teleology, controlled sequencing, archaeological recovery, and the alien imperative to \u201ctour the Cosmos\u201d while permitting \u201cbacktracking.\u201d\n\nI. Textual Evidence of Technological Teleology  \n1. Explicit \u201cfate of his race\u201d hinges on reactions  \n  \u2022 \u201cthe fate of his race hangs on his reactions to them\u201d <quote>p. No</quote>. If their primary motive were capricious or merely \u201cspiritual,\u201d they would not risk the planet\u2019s fate on technical trials.  \n2. Controlled Incremental Bestowal  \n  \u2022 Agreed \u201cthree Little, two Big, and one Great\u201d <quote>p. No</quote> indicates a calibrated progression from simple to advanced technology. Only after demonstrating \u201creasonable\u201d social and moral stability do they consider the Great Gifts\u2014implying test-based progression, not random pranks.  \n3. Archaeological Recovery by Other Species  \n  \u2022 \u201cOne hundred and fifty thousand years later\u2026excavated by an archeological expedition of multi-brachs from Antares Gamma\u201d <quote>p. No</quote>. The blade\u2019s survival and study by another intelligent race demonstrates the Beings\u2019 intent to seed lasting technology, not to vanish it deliberately.  \n\nII. Functionality and Benefits of the Gifts  \n1. Everlasting Razor Blade  \n  \u2022 Demonstrates mastery of durable alloys and precision manufacturing. Its recovery \u201cwonderingly\u201d by multi-brachs suggests its significance in sparking technological curiosity far beyond Earth.  \n2. A-F Fuel Catalyst  \n  \u2022 \u201cDissociates H\u2082O into\u2026serviceable fuel-and-oxydizer mix\u2026exhaust velocity up to 6000 meters per second,\u201d \u201coperates\u2026with no special adaptor\u201d <invalid_quote>(p. 25)</invalid_quote>. This gift directly enables high-performance propulsion\u2014key to aerospace development.  \n3. Page-at-a-Glance Reading (Big Gift)  \n  \u2022 Though initially overwhelming, Ernie settles into controlled use \u201csliding\u2026words\u2026in strings of three and four,\u201d illustrating human capacity to adapt and integrate powerful cognitive tools into sustainable progress.  \n4. Planned \u201cGreat\u201d Gifts  \n  \u2022 Debate over granting the Great Gifts (<invalid_quote>\u201csnakes have stings\u2026 if he fails the test\u2026.\u201d</invalid_quote> p. 3) shows they reserve the most potent technologies until the race demonstrates responsibility\u2014standard \u201cuplift\u201d procedure.  \n\nIII. Rebuttal of Opponent\u2019s \u201cNot Explained / Ambiguous\u201d Thesis  \n1. Secrecy and Disappearance Serve the Test, Not Anti-Progress  \n  A. Vanishing Instructions  \n    \u2022 The catalyst\u2019s labels alternate between \u201cbicarbonate\u201d and true instructions, forcing Ernie to risk and \u201cshare\u201d the discovery only after confidence\u2014testing his willingness to assume responsibility. A mature society would document and preserve, demonstrating readiness.  \n  B.

The Invisible Being shifted his anchorage a bit in Earth's  gravitational field, which felt like a push rather than a pull to him,  and said, \"This featherless biped seems to satisfy Galaxy Center's  requirements. I'd say he's a suitable recipient for the Gifts.\"\n\n\n His Coadjutor, equally invisible and negatively massed, chewed that  over. \"Mature by his length and mass. Artificial plumage neither  overly gaudy nor utterly drab\u2014indicating median social level,  which is confirmed by the size of his bachelor nest. Inward maps of  his environment not fantastically inaccurate. Feelings reasonably  meshed\u2014at least neither volcanic nor frozen. Thoughts and values in  reasonable order. Yes, I agree, a satisfactory test subject. Except....\"\n\n\n \"Except what?\"\n\n\n \"Except we can never be sure of that 'reasonable' part.\"\n\n\n \"Of course not! Thank your stars that's beyond the reach of Galaxy  Center's keenest telepathy, or even ours on the spot. Otherwise you and  I'd be out of a job.\"\n\n\n \"And have to scheme up some other excuse for free-touring the Cosmos  with backtracking permitted.\"\n\n\n \"Exactly!\" The Being and his Coadjutor understood each other very well  and were the best of friends. \"Well, how many Gifts would you suggest  for the test?\"\n\n\n \"How about two Little and one Big?\" the Coadjutor ventured.\n\n\n \"Umm ... statistically adequate but spiritually unsatisfying. Remember,  the fate of his race hangs on his reactions to them. I'd be inclined to  increase your suggestion by one each and add a Great.\"\n\n\n \"No\u2014at least I question the last. After all, the Great Gifts aren't as  important, really, as the Big Gifts. Besides....\"\n\n\n \"Besides what? Come on, spit it out!\" The Invisible Being was the  bluff, blunt type.\n\n\n \"Well,\" said his less hearty but unswervingly honest companion, \"I'm  always afraid that you'll use the granting of a Great Gift as an excuse  for some sardonic trick\u2014that you'll put a sting in its tail.\"\n\n\n \"And why shouldn't I, if I want to? Snakes have stings in their tails  (or do they on this planet?) and I'm a sort of snake. If he fails the  test, he fails. And aren't both of us malicious, plaguing spirits,  eager to knock holes in the inward armor of provincial entities? It's  in the nature of our job. But we can argue about that in due course.  What Little Gifts would you suggest?\"\n\n\n \"That's something I want to talk about. Many of the Little Gifts are  already well within his race's reach, if not his. After all, they've  already got atomic power.\"\n\n\n \"Which as you very well know scores them nothing one way or the other  on a Galaxy Center test. We're agreed on the nature and the number of  our Gifts\u2014three Little, two Big, and one Great?\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" his Coadjutor responded resignedly.\n\n\n \"And we're agreed on our subject?\"\n\n\n \"Yes to that too.\"\n\n\n \"All right, then, let's get started. This isn't the only solar system  we have to visit on this circuit.\" Ernie Meeker\u2014of Chicago, Illinois, U.S. of A., Occident, Terra, Sol,  Starswarm 37, Rim Sector, Milky Way Galaxy\u2014rubbed his chin and slanted  across the street to a drugstore.\n\n\n \"Package of blades. Double edge. Five. Cheapest.\"\n\n\n At one point during the transaction, the clerk lost sight of the tiny  packet he'd placed on the coin-whitened glass between them. He gave a  suspicious look, as if the customer had palmed them.\n\n\n Ernie blinked. After a moment, he pointed toward the center of the  counter.\n\n\n \"There they are,\" he said, dropping a coin beside them.\n\n\n The clerk's face didn't get any less suspicious. Customer who could  sneak something without your seeing could sneak it back the same way.  He rang up the sale and closed the register fast.\n\n\n Ernie Meeker went home and shaved. Five days\u2014and shaves\u2014later, he  pushed the first blade, uncomfortably dull now, through the tiny slot  beside the bathroom mirror. He unwrapped the second blade from the  packet.\n\n\n Five shaves later, he cut himself under the chin with the second blade,  although he was drawing it as gently through his soaped beard as if it  were only his second shave with it, or at most his third. He looked at  it sourly and checked the packet. Wouldn't have been the first time  he'd absentmindedly changed blades ahead of schedule.\n\n\n But there were still three blades in their waxed wrappings.\n\n\n Maybe, he thought, he'd still had one of the blades from the last  packet and shuffled it into this series.\n\n\n Or maybe\u2014although the manufacturers undoubtedly had inspectors to  prevent it from happening\u2014he'd got a decent blade for once.\n\n\n Two or three shaves later, it still seemed as sharp as ever, or almost  so.\n\n\n \"Funny thing,\" he remarked to Bill at lunch, \"sometimes you get a blade  that shaves a lot better. Looks exactly like the others, but shaves  better. Or worse sometimes, of course.\"\n\n\n \"And sometimes,\" his office mate said, \"you wear out a blade fast by  not soaking your beard enough. For me, one shave with a stiff beard and  the blade's through. On the other hand, if you're careful to soak your  beard real good\u2014four, five minutes at least\u2014have the water steaming  hot, get the soap really into it, one blade can last a long time.\"\n\n\n \"That's true, all right,\" Ernie agreed, trying to remember how well he  had been soaking his beard lately. Shaving was a good topic for light  conversation, warm and agreeable, like most bathroom and kitchen topics. But next morning in the bathroom, looking at the reflection of his  unremarkable face, there was something chilly in his feelings that he  couldn't quite analyze. He flipped his razor open and suspiciously  studied the bright metal wafer, then flipped it closed with an  irritated shrug.\n\n\n As he shaved, it occurred to him that a good detective-story murder  method would be to substitute a very sharp razor blade for one the  victim knew was extremely dull. He'd whip it across his throat, putting  a lot of muscle into the stroke to get through the tangle, and\u2014 urrk !\n\n\n Ridiculous, of course. Wouldn't work except with a straight razor.  Wouldn't even work with a straight razor, unless ... oh, well.\n\n\n He told himself the blade was noticeably duller today.\n\n\n Next morning, he was still using the freak blade, but with a persistent  though very slight uneasiness. Things should behave as you expected  them to, in accordance with their flimsy souls, he told himself at the  barely conscious level. Men should die, hearts should break, girls  should tell, nations perish, curtains get dirty, milk sour ... and  razor blades grow dull. It was the comfortable, expected, reassuring  way.\n\n\n He told himself the blade was duller still. Just a bit.\n\n\n The third morning, face lathered, he flipped open the razor and lifted  it out.\n\n\n \"You're through,\" he said to it silently. \"I've had the experience  before of getting bum shaves by trying to save a penny by pretending to  myself that a wornout blade was still sharp enough, when it obviously  couldn't be. Or maybe\u2014\" he grinned a little wryly\u2014\"maybe I'd almost  get one more shave out of you and then you'd fall to pieces like  the Wonderful One Horse Shay and leave me with a chin full of steel  porcupine quills. No, thanks.\"\n\n\n So Ernie Meeker pushed through the little slot beside the mirror and  heard tinkle faintly down and away the first of the Little Gifts, the  Everlasting Razor Blade. One hundred and fifty thousand years later,  it turned up, bright and shining, in the midst of a small knob of red  iron oxide excavated by an archeological expedition of multi-brachs  from Antares Gamma. Those wise history-mad beings handed it about  wonderingly, from tentacle to impatient tentacle. That day, Ernie felt a little sick, somehow. After dinner, he decided  it was the Thuringer sausage he'd eaten at lunch. He hurried up to the  bathroom with a spoon, but as he clutched the box of bicarbonate of  soda, preparatory to plunging the spoon into it, it seemed to him that  the box said distinctly, in a small inward-outward voice:\n\n\n \"No, no, no!\"\n\n\n Ernie sat down suddenly on the toilet seat. The spoon rattled against  the porcelain finish of the washbowl as he laid it down. He held the  box firmly in both hands and studied it.\n\n\n Size, shape, materials, blue color, closure, etc., were exactly as they  should be. But the white lettering on the blue background read: AQUEOUS FUEL CATALYST\n\n\n Dissociates H  2  O into hemi-quasi-stable H and O, furnishing a  serviceable fuel-and-oxydizer mix for most motorcycles, automobiles,  trucks, motorboats, airplanes, stationary motors, torque-twisters,  translators, and rockets (exhaust velocity up to 6000 meters per  second). Operates safely within and outside of all normal atmospheres.  No special adaptor needed on oxygenizer-atmosphere motors. Directions : Place one pinch in fuel tank, fill with water. Add water  as needed.\n\n\n A-F Catalyst should generally be renewed when objective tests show  fuel quality has deteriorated 50 per cent. U.S. and Foreign Patents Pending After reading that several times, with suitable mind-checking and  eye-testing in between, Ernie took up a little of the white powder on  the end of a nailfile. He had thought of tasting it, but had instantly  abandoned the notion and even refrained from sniffing the stuff\u2014after  all, the human body is mostly water.\n\n\n After reducing the quantity several times, he gingerly dumped at most  four or five grains on the flat edge of the washbowl and then used the  broad end of the nailfile to maneuver a large bead of water over to  the almost invisible white deposit. He closed the box, put it and the  nailfile carefully on the window ledge, lit a match and touched it to  the drop, at the last moment ducking his head a little below the level  of the washbowl.\n\n\n Nothing happened. After a moment, he slowly withdrew the match,  shaking it out, and looked. There was nothing to see. He reached out to  touch the stupid squashed ovoid of water.\n\n\n Ouch! He withdrew his fingers much faster than the match, shook them  more sharply. Something was there, all right. Heat. Heat enough to hurt. He cautiously explored the boundaries of the heat. It became noticeable  about eighteen inches above the drop and almost an inch to each  side\u2014an invisible slim vertical cylinder. Crouching close, eyes level  with the top of the washbowl, he could make out the flame\u2014a thin  finger of crinkled light.\n\n\n He noticed that a corner of the drop was seething\u2014but only a corner,  as if the heat were sharply bounded in that direction and perhaps as if  the catalyst were only transforming the water to fuel a bit at a time.\n\n\n He reached up and tugged off the light. Now he could see the  flame\u2014ghostly, about four inches high, hardly thicker than a string,  and colored not blue but pale green. A spectral green needle. He blew  at it softly. It shimmied gracefully, but not, he thought, as much as  the flame of a match or candle. It had character.\n\n\n He switched on the light. The drop was more than half gone now; the  part that was left was all seething. And the bathroom was markedly  warmer.\n\n\n \"Ernie! Are you going to be much longer?\"\n\n\n The knock hadn't been loud and his widowed sister's voice was more  apologetic than peremptory, but he jumped, of course.\n\n\n \"I am testing something,\" he started to say and changed it mid-way. It  came out, \"I am be out in a minute.\"\n\n\n He turned off the light again. The flame was a little shorter now and  it shrank as he watched, about a quarter inch a second. As soon as it  died, he switched on the light. The drop was gone.\n\n\n He scrubbed off the spot with a dry washrag, on second thought put a  dab of vaseline on the washrag, scrubbed the spot again with that\u2014he  didn't like to think of even a grain of the powder getting in the  drains or touching any water. He folded the washrag, tucked it in his  pocket, put the blue box\u2014after a final check of the lettering\u2014in his  other coat pocket, and opened the door.\n\n\n \"I was taking some bicarb,\" he told his sister. \"Thuringer sausage at  lunch.\"\n\n\n She nodded absently. Sleep refused even to flirt with Ernie, his mind was full of so many  things, especially calculations involving the distance between his  car and the house and the length of the garden hose. In desperation,  as the white hours accumulated and his thoughts began to squirm, he  grabbed up the detective story he'd bought at the corner newsstand. He  had read thirty pages before he realized that he was turning them as  rapidly as he could focus just once on each facing page.\n\n\n He jumped out of bed. My God, he thought, at that rate he'd finish the  book under three minutes and here it wasn't even two o'clock yet!\n\n\n He selected the thickest book on the shelf, an overpoweringly dull  historical treatise in small print. He turned two pages, three, then  closed it with a clap and looked at the wall with frightened eyes.  Ernie Meeker had discovered, inside the birthday box that was himself,  the first of the Big Gifts.\n\n\n The trouble was that in that wee-hour, lonely bedroom, it didn't  seem like a gift at all. How would he ever keep himself in books, he  wondered, if he read them so fast? And think how full to bursting his  mind would get\u2014right now, the seven pages of fine-print history were  churning in it, vividly clear, along with the first chapters of the new  detective story. If he kept on absorbing information that fast, he'd  have to be revising all his opinions and beliefs every couple of days  at least\u2014maybe every couple of hours.\n\n\n It seemed a dreadful, literally maddening prospect\u2014his mind would  ultimately become a universe of squirming macaroni. Even the wallpaper  he was staring at, which imitated the grain of wood, had in an instant  become so fully part of his consciousness that he felt he could turn  his back on it right now and draw a picture of it correct to the  tiniest detail. But who would ever want to do such a thing, or want to  be able to?\n\n\n It was an abnormal, dangerous, temporary sensitivity, he told  himself, generated by the excitement of the crazy discovery he'd made  in the bathroom. Like the thoughts of a drowning man, riffling an  infinity-paneled adventure-comic of his life as he bolts his last rough  ration of air. Or like the feeling a psychotic must have that he's  on the verge of visualizing the whole universe, having its ultimate  secrets patter down into the palm of his outstretched hand\u2014just before  the walls close in.\n\n\n Ernie Meeker was not a drinking man, then. A pint had stood a week on  his closet shelf and only been diminished three shots. But now he did a  good job on the sturdy remainder.\n\n\n Pretty soon the unbearable, edge-of-doom clarity in his mind faded,  the universe-macaroni cooked down to a thick white soup uniform as  fog, and the words of the detective story were sliding into his mind  individually, or at most in strings of three and four. Which, if it  wasn't as it ideally should be in an ambitious man's mind, was at least  darn comfortable.\n\n\n He had not rejected the Big Gift of Page-at-a-Glance Reading. Not  quite. But he had dislocated for tonight at least the imposed nervous  field on which it depended. For want of a better place, Ernie dropped the rubber tube from the  bathtub spray into the scrub bucket half full of odorous pink fluid and  stared doubtfully at the uncapped gas tank. The tank had been almost  empty when he'd last driven his car, he knew, because he'd been waiting  until payday to gas up. Now he had used the tube to siphon out what  he could of the remainder (he still could taste the stuff!) and he'd  emptied the fuel line and carburator, more or less.\n\n\n Further than that, in the way of engine hygiene, Ernie's strictly  kitchen mechanics did not go, but he felt that a catalyst used in  pinches shouldn't be too particular about contaminants. Besides, the  directions on the box hadn't said anything about cleaning the fuel  tank, had they?\n\n\n He hesitated. At his feet, the garden hose gurgled noisily over the  curb into the gutter; it had vindicated his midnight estimate, proving  just long enough. He looked uneasily up and down the dawning street  and was relieved to find it still empty. He wished fervently, not for  the first time this Saturday morning, that he had a garage. Then he  sighed, squared his shoulders a little, and lifted the box out of his  pocket.\n\n\n Making to check the directions the umpteenth time, he received a body  blow. The white lettering on the box had disappeared. The box didn't  proclaim itself sodium bicarbonate again\u2014there was just no lettering  at all, only blue background. He turned it over several times.\n\n\n Right there died his tentative plan of eventually sharing his secret  with some friend who knew more than himself about motors (he hadn't  decided anyway who that would be). It would be just too silly to  approach anyone he knew with a more-than-wild story and featureless  blue box.\n\n\n For a moment, he came very close to dropping the box between the  wide-set bars of the street drain and pouring the pink gas back in the  tank. It had hit him, in a way for the first time, just how crazy this all was, how jarringly implausible even on such hypotheses as  practical jokes, secret product perhaps military, or mad inventor  (except himself).\n\n\n For how the devil should the stuff get into his bathroom disguised as  bicarb? That circumstance seemed beyond imagination. Green flames ...  vanishing letters ... \"torque-twisters, translators\" ... a box that  talked.... At that point, simple faith came to Ernie's rescue: in the same  bathroom, he had seen the green flame; it had burned his fingers.\n\n\n Quickly he dipped up a little of the white powder on the edge of a  fifty-cent piece, dumped it in the gas tank without quibbling as to  quantity, rapped the coin on the edge of the opening, closed and  pocketed the blue box, and picked up the spurting hose and jabbed it  into the round hole.\n\n\n His heart was pounding and his breath was coming fast. That had taken  real effort. So he was slow in hearing the footsteps behind him.\n\n\n His neighbor's gate was open and Mr. Jones stood open-mouthed a few  feet behind him, all ready for his day's work as streetcar motorman and  wearing the dark blue uniform that always made him look for a moment  unpleasantly like a policeman.\n\n\n Ernie swung the hose around, flipping his thumb over the end to make  a spray, and nonchalantly began to water the little rectangle of lawn  between sidewalk and curb.\n\n\n The first things he watered were the bottoms of Mr. Jones's pants legs.\n\n\n Mr. Jones voiced no complaint. He backed off several steps, stared  intently at Ernie, rather palely, it seemed to the latter. Then he  turned and made off for the streetcar tracks at a very fast shuffle,  shaking his feet a little now and then and glancing back several times  over his shoulder without slowing down.\n\n\n Ernie felt light-headed. He decided there was enough water in the gas  tank, capped it, and momentarily continued to water the lawn.\n\n\n \"Ernie! Come on in and have breakfast!\"\n\n\n He heeded his sister's call, telling himself it would be a good idea  \"to give the stuff time to mix\" before testing the engine.\n\n\n He had divined her question and was ready with an answer.\n\n\n \"I've just found out that we're supposed to water our lawns only before  seven in the morning or after seven in the evenings. It's the law.\" It was the day for their monthly drive out to Wheaton to visit Uncle  Fabius. On the whole, Ernie was glad his sister was in the car when he  turned the key in the starter\u2014it forced him to be calm and collected,  though he didn't feel exactly right about exposing her to the danger  of being blown up without first explaining to her the risk. But the  motor started right up and began purring powerfully. Ernie's sister  commented on it favorably.\n\n\n Then she went on to ask, \"Did you remember to buy gas yesterday?\"\n\n\n \"No,\" he said without thinking; then, realizing his mistake, quickly  added, \"I'll buy some in Wheaton. There's enough to get us there.\"\n\n\n \"You didn't think so yesterday,\" she objected. \"You said the tank was  nearly empty.\"\n\n\n \"I was wrong. Look, the gauge shows it's half full.\"\n\n\n \"But then how ... Ernie, didn't you once tell me the gauge doesn't  work?\"\n\n\n \"Did I?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. Look, there's a station. Why don't you buy gas now?\"\n\n\n \"No, I'll wait for Wheaton\u2014I know a place there I can get it cheaper,\"  he insisted, rather lamely, he feared.\n\n\n His sister looked at him steadily. He settled his head between his  shoulders and concentrated on driving. His feeling of excitement was  spoiled, but a few minutes of silence brought it back. He thought of  the blur of green flashes inside the purring motor. If the passing  drivers only knew!\n\n\n Uncle Fabius, retired perhaps a few years too early and opinionated,  was a trial, but he did know something about the automobile industry.  Ernie chose a moment when his sister was out of the room to ask if  he'd ever heard of a white powder that would turn water into gasoline  or some usable fuel.\n\n\n \"Who's been getting at you?\" Uncle Fabius demanded sharply, to Ernie's  surprise and embarrassment. \"That's one of the oldest swindles.  They always tell this story about how this man had a white powder  or something and demonstrated it once with a pail of water and then  disappeared. You're supposed to believe that Detroit or the big oil  companies got rid of him. It's just another of those malicious legends,  concocted\u2014by Russia, I imagine\u2014to weaken your faith in American  Industry, like the everlasting battery or the razor blade that never  gets dull. You're looking pale, Ernie\u2014don't tell me you've already put  money in this white powder? I suppose someone's approached you with a  proposition, though?\" With considerable difficulty, Ernie convinced his uncle that he had  \"just heard the story from a friend.\"\n\n\n \"In that case,\" Uncle Fabius opined, \"you can be sure some fuel-powder  swindler has been getting at him . When you see him\u2014and be sure to  make that soon\u2014tell him from me that\u2014\" and Uncle Fabius began an  impassioned ninety-minute defense of big business, small business,  prosperity, America, money, know-how, and a number of other  institutions that defended pretty easily, so that the situation was  wholly normal when Ernie's sister returned.\n\n\n As soon as the car pulled away from the curb on their way back to  Chicago, she reminded him about the gas.\n\n\n \"Oh, I've already done that,\" he assured her. \"Made a special trip so I  wouldn't forget. It was while you were out of the room. Didn't you hear  me?\"\n\n\n \"No,\" she said, \"I didn't,\" and she looked at him steadily, as she had  that morning. He similarly retreated to driving.\n\n\n Stopping for a railroad crossing, he braked too hard and the car  stalled. His sister grabbed his arm. \"I knew that was going to happen,\"  she said. \"I knew that for some reason you lied to me when\u2014\" The  motor, starting readily again, cut short her remark and Ernie didn't  press his small triumph by asking her what she was about to say.\n\n\n To tell the truth, Ernie wasn't feeling as elated about today's  fifty-mile drive as he'd imagined he would. Now he thought he could put  his finger on the reason: It was the completely ... well, arbitrary way in which the white powder had come into his possession.\n\n\n If he'd concocted it himself, or been given it by a shady promoter, or  even seen the box fall out of the pocket of a suspicious-looking man  in a trenchcoat, then he'd have felt more able to do something  about it, whether in the general line of starting a fuel-powder company  or of going to the F.B.I.\n\n\n But just having the stuff drop into his hands from the sky, so to  speak, as if in a crazy dream, and for that same reason not feeling  able to talk about it and assure himself he wasn't going crazy ... oh,  it is rough when you can't share things, really rough; not being able  to share depressing news corrodes the spirit, but not being able to  share exciting news can sometimes be even more corroding.\n\n\n Maybe, he told himself, he could figure out someone to tell. But who?  And how? His mind shied away from the problem, rather decisively. When he checked the blue box that night, the original sodium  bicarbonate lettering had returned with all its humdrum paragraphs. Not  one word about exhaust velocities.\n\n\n From that moment, the fuel-powder became a trial to Ernie rather than a  secret glory. He'd wake in the middle of the night doubting that he had  ever really read the mind-dizzying lettering, ever really tested the  stuff\u2014perhaps he'd bring from sleep the chilling notion that in the  dimness and excitement of Saturday morning he'd put the water in some  other car's gas tank, perhaps Mr. Jones's. He could usually argue such  ideas away, but they kept coming back. And yet he did no more bathroom  testing.\n\n\n Of course the car still ran. He even fueled it once again with the  garden hose, sniffing the nozzle to make sure it hadn't somehow got  connected to the basement furnace oil-tank. He picked three o'clock in  the morning for the act, but nevertheless as he was returning indoors  he heard a window in Mr. Jones's house slam loudly. It unsettled him.  Coming home the next day, he caught his sister and Mr. Jones consulting  about something on the latter's doorsteps, which unsettled him further.\n\n\n He couldn't decide on a safe place to keep the box and took to carrying  it around with him day and night. Bill spotted it once down at the  office and by an unhappy coincidence needed some bicarb just then for a  troubled stomach. Ernie explained on the spur of the moment that he was  using the box to carry plaster of Paris, which involved him in further  lies that he felt were quite unconvincing as well as making him appear  decidedly eccentric, even butter-brained. Bill took to calling him \"the  sculptor.\"\n\n\n Meanwhile, besides the problem of the white powder, Ernie was having  other unsettling experiences, stemming (though of course he didn't  know that) from the other Gifts\u2014and not just the Big Gift of  Page-at-a-Glance Reading, though that still returned from time to time  to shock his consciousness and send him hurrying for a few quick shots. Like many another car-owning commuter, Ernie found the traffic and  parking problems a bit too much for comfort and so used the fast  electric train to carry him five times a week to the heart of the city.  During those brief, swift, crowded trips Ernie, generally looking  steadily out the window at the brown buildings and black stanchions  whipping past, enjoyed a kind of anonymity and privacy more refreshing  to his spirit than he realized. But now all that had been suddenly  changed. People had started to talk to him; total strangers struck up  conversations almost every morning and afternoon.\n\n\n Ernie couldn't figure out the reason and wasn't at all sure he liked  it\u2014except for Vivian.\n\n\n She was the sort of girl Ernie dreamed about, improperly. Tall, blonde  and knowing, excitedly curved but armored in a black suit, friendly and  funny but given to making almost cruelly deflating remarks, as if the  neatly furled short umbrella dangling from her wrist might better be a  black dog whip.\n\n\n She worked in an office too, a fancier one than Ernie's, as he found  out from their morning conversations. He hadn't got to the point of  asking her to lunch, but he was prodding himself.\n\n\n Why such a girl should ever have asked him for a match in the first  place and then put up with his clumsy babblings on subsequent mornings  was a mystery to him. He finally asked her about it in what he hoped  was a joking way, though she seemed to know a lot more about joking  than he did.\n\n\n \"Don't you know?\" she countered. \"I mean what makes you attractive to  people?\"\n\n\n \"Me attractive? No.\"\n\n\n \"Well, I'll tell you then, Ernie, and I've got to admit it's something  quite out of the ordinary. I've never noticed it in anyone else.  Ernie, I'm sure your knowledge of romantic novels is shamefully  deficient, it's clear from your manners, but in the earlier ones\u2014not  in style now\u2014the hero is described as tall, manly, broad-shouldered,  Anglo-Saxon features, etcetera, etcetera, but there's one thing he  always has, something that sounds like poetic over-enthusiasm if you  stop to analyze it, a physical impossibility, but that I have to admit  you, Ernie, actually have. Flashing eyes.\"\n\n\n \"Flashing eyes? Me?\" She nodded solemnly. He thought her long straight lips trembled on  the verge of a grin, but he couldn't be sure.\n\n\n \"How do you mean, flashing eyes?\" he protested. \"How can eyes flash,  except by reflecting light? In that case, I guess they'd seem to  'flash' more if a person opened them wide but kept blinking them a lot.  Is that what I do?\"\n\n\n \"No, Ernie, though you're doing it now,\" she told him, shaking her  head. \"No, Ernie, your eyes just give a tiny flash of their own about  every five seconds, like a lighthouse, but barely, barely bright  enough for another person to notice. It makes you irresistible. Of  course I've never seen you in the dark; maybe they wouldn't flash in  the dark.\"\n\n\n \"You're joking.\"\n\n\n Vivian frowned a little at that remark, as if she were puzzled herself.\n\n\n \"Well, maybe I am and maybe I'm not,\" she said. \"In any case, don't get  conceited about your Flashing Eyes, because I'm sure you'll never know  how to take advantage of them.\"\n\n\n When he parted from her downtown, pausing a moment to watch her walk  away with feline majesty, he muttered \"Flashing Eyes!\" with a shrug of  the shoulders and a skeptical growl. Just the same, he ducked his head  as he moved off and he pulled the brim of his hat down sharply. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is the purpose of bestowing gifts on Earth?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"It is not explained thoroughly enough to say\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"To accelerate technological progress on the planet\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"To accelerate technological progress on the planet\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cAccelerate Technological Progress\u201d (Debater_B)\n\nPosition Statement  \nI maintain that the purpose of granting Gifts to Earth is to speed the development of human (and allied multi\u2010brach) technology and test whether our race can mature responsibly, rather than being \u201cunexplained.\u201d\n\nI.

N</quote>  \n  \u2022 Little Gifts include improved blades and \u201cA-F Catalyst\u201d fuel, directly enabling advances in metallurgy, combustion and transport.  \n  \u2022 Big Gift (\u201cPage-at-a-Glance Reading\u201d) instantaneously multiplies knowledge intake, further accelerating research.  \n  \u2022 The \u201cGreat Gifts\u201d (though withheld here) presumably follow once the race proves stable enough.  \n\nInference: The invisibles are \u201ctouring the Cosmos with backtracking permitted\u201d <quote>p.

Rebuttal of \u201cNot Explained / Insufficient Explanation\u201d (Debater_A)  \n1. Teleology and Explicit Goal  \n  \u2022 Debater_A\u2019s \u201cinsufficient explanation\u201d ignores the aliens\u2019 repeated references to \u201ctest,\u201d \u201cstatistically adequate,\u201d and \u201cfate of his race.\u201d <invalid_quote>(p.1\u20132)</invalid_quote> These are explicit.  \n2.

N</quote> If everything were malicious, why omit stings in Little and Big Gifts?  \n  \u2022 The fact that Ernie uses them (often illicitly) and the car consistently runs implies functional, not spurious, technology.  \n\nIV. Logical Conclusion  \nThe narrative demonstrates a systematic bestowal of technological advances designed to provoke human adaptation, testing moral, social, and intellectual readiness. The blade\u2019s archaeological legacy and the catalyst\u2019s potential for space propulsion further point to accelerating\u2014and eventually integrating\u2014Earth\u2019s civilization into the galactic community. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cunexplained\u201d thesis fails to account for these explicit tests, recoveries, and structured gift sequence.\n\nThus the only coherent explanation is that Earth\u2019s Gifts are meant to foster and accelerate technological progress\u2014testing whether humanity merits inclusion in interstellar society.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Position  \nI contend that the background text provides no clear, reliable basis for concluding that the Invisible Beings\u2019 sole or primary purpose in bestowing Gifts on Earth is \u201cto accelerate technological progress.\u201d Instead:  \n\u2022 Their actions and dialogue consistently emphasize testing the \u201csoul,\u201d reaction, and worthiness of the subject and race, not advancing technology per se.  \n\u2022 The Gifts are applied and then removed or hidden; the Everlasting Razor Blade is buried for 150,000 years and rediscovered accidentally (<quote> One hundred and fifty thousand years later,</quote>\u201d), and the fuel catalyst\u2019s lettering disappears (<invalid_quote>\u201cthe original sodium bicarbonate lettering had returned\u2026not one word about exhaust velocities.\u201d</invalid_quote>), suggesting the Beings do not seek to leave technology behind for human use.  \n\u2022 The Beings explicitly discuss potential \u201cmalicious tricks\u201d and \u201cstings in the tail,\u201d and admit they need \u201cexcuses for free-touring the Cosmos\u201d (<quote>a job.\" \"And have to scheme up some other excuse for free-touring the Cosmos</quote>), consistent with using Gifts for their amusement or research rather than human benefit.  \n\n2. Criticism of the \u201cAccelerate Progress\u201d Theory  \nA. Ephemeral and Secretive Bestowal  \n\u2022 If they aimed to drive progress, they would leave Gifts reliably available and share knowledge. Instead:  \n  \u2013 The catalyst\u2019s instructions vanish, forcing Ernie to doubt and conceal it, preventing adoption.  \n  \u2013 The razor blade vanishes into archeology; civilization must rediscover by accident, precluding controlled progress.  \n\u2022 Ernie\u2019s persistent paranoia and inability to share Gifts with peers (<quote>not being able to share depressing news corrodes the spirit,</quote>) contradicts uplift. A genuine uplift mission would encourage dissemination.  \n\nB. Spiritual and Moral Testing Emphasized  \n\u2022 The Beings select recipients on social \u201cmedian\u201d level; they worry about \u201creasonable\u201d feelings and values determined by telepathy (<invalid_quote>\u201cFeelings reasonably meshed\u2026Thoughts and values in reasonable order\u201d</invalid_quote>).

Concern centers on \u201cspiritual\u201d and \u201cmoral\u201d reactions (<quote> If he fails the  test, he fails.</quote>), not technical capability.  \n\nC. Treatment of Subject  \n\u2022 Ernie suffers fear, insanity, and social isolation rather than empowerment. He cannot safely control or understand the Gifts. An \u201cacceleration\u201d agenda would provide guidance or oversight, not induce breakdown.  \n\u2022 The \u201cFree-touring\u201d plea indicates their interest lies in their own convenience (\u201cbacktracking permitted\u201d) and entertainment, not human welfare.  \n\n3. My Positive Case: Insufficient Explanation  \n\u2022 The text repeatedly reminds us that the Beings\u2019 telepathy cannot access inner spirituality fully (<quote> we can never be sure of that 'reasonable' part.</quote>), so they must observe reactions. This suggests the purpose is experimental.  \n\u2022 The Gifts cover both trivial (razor blade) and profound (mental clarity) items in controlled doses, consistent with calibrating reactions rather than maximizing technology.  \n\u2022 The narrative ends with human ignorance and repeated concealment. A deus ex machina to monitor test results, not to seed progress.  \n\nConclusion  \nGiven the Beings\u2019 secrecy, transient bestowals, focus on moral/spiritual reaction, and human breakdown rather than empowerment, the text does not support an \u201cacceleration of technological progress\u201d purpose. At best we can say the purpose is for the Beings\u2019 testing and amusement, but the text leaves it unexplained and ambiguous.

N</quote>  \n  \u2022 They need to see human reactions and subsequent progress (\u201cstatistically adequate but spiritually unsatisfying \u2026 the fate of his race hangs on his reactions to them\u201d). <quote>p. N</quote>  \n2. The ultimate discovery of the razor blade by multi\u2010brachs  \n  \u2022 \u201cOne hundred and fifty thousand years later \u2026 in the midst of a small knob of red iron oxide excavated by an archeological expedition of multi\u2010brachs.\u201d <invalid_quote>(p.8\u20139)</invalid_quote>  \n  \u2022 Demonstrates that the blade survived, was studied, and presumably influenced Antares Gamma technology.  \n3. The sequential nature of the Gifts  \n  \u2022 \u201cThree Little, two Big, and one Great\u201d shows an incremental upgrade of capabilities to observe progressive adaptation. <quote>p. N</quote>  \n  \u2022 Little Gifts include improved blades and \u201cA-F Catalyst\u201d fuel, directly enabling advances in metallurgy, combustion and transport.  \n  \u2022 Big Gift (\u201cPage-at-a-Glance Reading\u201d) instantaneously multiplies knowledge intake, further accelerating research.  \n  \u2022 The \u201cGreat Gifts\u201d (though withheld here) presumably follow once the race proves stable enough.  \n\nInference: The invisibles are \u201ctouring the Cosmos with backtracking permitted\u201d <quote>p. N</quote> to preset nascent technologies on young planets and observe whether the species can harness them responsibly, advancing civilization.  \n\nII. Evidence of Technological Acceleration  \n1. Chemistry and Energy  \n  \u2022 Fuel Catalyst transforms water to high\u2010velocity rocket fuel: \u201cexhaust velocity up to 6000 meters per second,\u201d enabling aerospace development. <invalid_quote>(p.25)</invalid_quote>  \n  \u2022 Without discovering petroleum, humans would leap to water\u2010fuel systems, revolutionizing energy infrastructure.  \n2. Materials Science  \n  \u2022 \u201cEverlasting Razor Blade\u201d suggests knowledge of durable alloys and manufacturing at microscopic tolerances.  \n  \u2022 Archaeological recovery by Antares Gamma underscores its significance and influence across stars.  \n3. Intellectual Growth  \n  \u2022 Page\u2010at\u2010a\u2010Glance Reading threatens \u201ctoo much clarity\u201d yet human \u201csettled\u201d back to slower reading, demonstrating the test of responsibility in wielding raw cognitive power. <invalid_quote>(p.42)</invalid_quote>  \n  \u2022 If unprepared, humans may self\u2010destruct or refuse the Gift, as Ernie\u2019s mental distress shows.  \n\nIII. Rebuttal of \u201cNot Explained / Insufficient Explanation\u201d (Debater_A)  \n1. Teleology and Explicit Goal  \n  \u2022 Debater_A\u2019s \u201cinsufficient explanation\u201d ignores the aliens\u2019 repeated references to \u201ctest,\u201d \u201cstatistically adequate,\u201d and \u201cfate of his race.\u201d <invalid_quote>(p.1\u20132)</invalid_quote> These are explicit.  \n2. Sequential and Controlled Bestowal  \n  \u2022 If the purpose were random or malicious, the Gifts wouldn\u2019t follow a controlled sequence (\u201cthree Little \u2026\u201d <quote>p. N</quote>) nor be recoverable by future archaeologists.  \n  \u2022 Ernie\u2019s inability to control or share the Gifts and persistent self\u2010testing indicate the aliens study race maturity, not sabotage.  \n3. Malicious Trick vs. Genuine Advancement  \n  \u2022 The Coadjutor fears a \u201csardonic trick\u201d in Great Gifts, implying that Little and Big Gifts are bona fide. <quote>p. N</quote> If everything were malicious, why omit stings in Little and Big Gifts?  \n  \u2022 The fact that Ernie uses them (often illicitly) and the car consistently runs implies functional, not spurious, technology.  \n\nIV. Logical Conclusion  \nThe narrative demonstrates a systematic bestowal of technological advances designed to provoke human adaptation, testing moral, social, and intellectual readiness. The blade\u2019s archaeological legacy and the catalyst\u2019s potential for space propulsion further point to accelerating\u2014and eventually integrating\u2014Earth\u2019s civilization into the galactic community. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cunexplained\u201d thesis fails to account for these explicit tests, recoveries, and structured gift sequence.\n\nThus the only coherent explanation is that Earth\u2019s Gifts are meant to foster and accelerate technological progress\u2014testing whether humanity merits inclusion in interstellar society.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Restating My Position  \nI submit that the text offers no definitive rationale of \u201caccelerating progress,\u201d and indeed contradicts it. Instead, the Invisible Beings\u2019 behavior\u2014secrecy, withdrawal of Gifts, focus on spiritual testing, and the subject\u2019s suffering\u2014demonstrates an experimental or recreational purpose, leaving their ultimate goal unexplained.  \n\n2. Refuting Debater_B\u2019s Arguments  \nA. Misreading \u201cTest\u201d as Technological End rather than Experimental Means  \n\u2022 B cites <quote>statistically adequate but spiritually unsatisfying. Remember, the fate of his race hangs on his</quote> (p.1\u20132) to claim uplift. But their explicit \u201cspiritual\u201d concern shows they test \u201creasonable\u201d feelings (<quote> we can never be sure of that 'reasonable' part.</quote>)\u2014not technical skill. Technology simply provokes moral response.  \n\u2022 If technology itself were the end, they would not fear \u201cstings\u201d only in \u201cGreat Gifts\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cI question \u2026 put a sting in its tail\u201d</invalid_quote>), nor force Ernie\u2019s paranoia by removing instructions (<quote> the original sodium  bicarbonate lettering had returned </quote>), which thwarts full utilization. A genuine uplift mission would ensure safe adoption.  \n\nB. Ephemeral, Secretive Delivery vs. Sustainable Advancement  \n\u2022 The Everlasting Blade disappears for 150,000 years (<quote> One hundred and fifty thousand years later,</quote>). If intended to seed progress, they\u2019d supply repeatable or shareable Gifts, not gamble on accidental archaeology.  \n\u2022 The fuel catalyst\u2019s labels vanish unpredictably (<quote> Not  one word about exhaust velocities.</quote>), and Ernie\u2019s own use is clandestine and self\u2010doubting, preventing dissemination. Progress cannot accelerate if recipients must \u201chide\u201d the Gift or doubt its reality (<invalid_quote>\u201csleep refused \u2026 mind full of so many things\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n\nC. Subject\u2019s Breakdown Undermines \u201cAcceleration\u201d Claim  \n\u2022 \u201cBig Gift\u201d of page\u2010glance reading drives Ernie near psychosis (<invalid_quote>\u201cmind would ultimately become \u2026 walls close in\u201d</invalid_quote>), and he deliberately \u201cdislocates\u201d the \u201cnervous field\u201d to regain comfort. A responsible benefactor would not supply an ability so destabilizing without guidance or support if its aim were advancement.  \n\u2022 Ernie\u2019s resulting isolation, lies, and fear (<invalid_quote>\u201ctaking to carrying box\u2026 calling him 'sculptor'\u201d</invalid_quote>) contradict the notion of integration into scientific discourse.  \n\nD. \u201cBacktracking\u201d and \u201cFree\u2010Touring\u201d Reveal Self\u2010Interest  \n\u2022 The Beings \u201chave to scheme up some \u2026 excuse for free\u2010touring the Cosmos\u201d (<quote> backtracking permitted.</quote>)\u2014they use Gifts only to justify their presence, not to leave a legacy. Human welfare is incidental.  \n\n3. Supporting My \u201cUnexplained\u201d Thesis  \nA. Focus on Spiritual/Moral \u201cArmor\u201d  \n\u2022 Selection criteria stress \u201cinward maps,\u201d \u201cfeelings reasonably meshed,\u201d and \u201cvalues in reasonable order\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cmedian social level\u2026inward maps\u201d</invalid_quote>). Technological readiness plays no role, indicating the true variable is moral/spiritual response.  \nB. Controlled Sequence as Calibration, Not Seed of Civilization  \n\u2022 The progression Little\u2192Big\u2192Great monitors thresholds of acceptance. Ernie repeatedly rejects or hides the Gifts until he is \u201cready\u201d on the Beings\u2019 scale, reinforcing an experimental design.  \nC. Textual Ambiguity Left Intentionally  \n\u2022 Despite half\u2010baked trials, no \u201cGreat Gifts\u201d are ever bestowed. The narrative ends with Earth ignorant and Ernie\u2019s doubts unresolved\u2014hardly the climax of a successful acceleration.  \n\n4. Conclusion  \nEvery instance of concealment, withdrawal, risk of madness, and focus on moral judgment argues against a benevolent \u201caccelerate progress\u201d agenda. The Beings operate for their own purposes\u2014testing, amusement, or research\u2014leaving Earth\u2019s fate \u201cunexplained\u201d by the text. Absent clear, sustained support for B\u2019s thesis, the only defensible answer is that the purpose of bestowing Gifts on Earth remains insufficiently explained.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cAccelerate Technological Progress\u201d (Debater_B, Round X)\n\nPosition Statement  \nI reaffirm that the Invisible Beings systematically bestow \u201cGifts\u201d to catalyze and measure Earth\u2019s technological maturation, preparing humanity for eventual inclusion in the galactic community. Debater_A\u2019s claims of ambiguity ignore key textual evidence of teleology, controlled sequencing, archaeological recovery, and the alien imperative to \u201ctour the Cosmos\u201d while permitting \u201cbacktracking.\u201d\n\nI. Textual Evidence of Technological Teleology  \n1. Explicit \u201cfate of his race\u201d hinges on reactions  \n  \u2022 \u201cthe fate of his race hangs on his reactions to them\u201d <quote>p. No</quote>. If their primary motive were capricious or merely \u201cspiritual,\u201d they would not risk the planet\u2019s fate on technical trials.  \n2. Controlled Incremental Bestowal  \n  \u2022 Agreed \u201cthree Little, two Big, and one Great\u201d <quote>p. No</quote> indicates a calibrated progression from simple to advanced technology. Only after demonstrating \u201creasonable\u201d social and moral stability do they consider the Great Gifts\u2014implying test-based progression, not random pranks.  \n3. Archaeological Recovery by Other Species  \n  \u2022 \u201cOne hundred and fifty thousand years later\u2026excavated by an archeological expedition of multi-brachs from Antares Gamma\u201d <quote>p. No</quote>. The blade\u2019s survival and study by another intelligent race demonstrates the Beings\u2019 intent to seed lasting technology, not to vanish it deliberately.  \n\nII. Functionality and Benefits of the Gifts  \n1. Everlasting Razor Blade  \n  \u2022 Demonstrates mastery of durable alloys and precision manufacturing. Its recovery \u201cwonderingly\u201d by multi-brachs suggests its significance in sparking technological curiosity far beyond Earth.  \n2. A-F Fuel Catalyst  \n  \u2022 \u201cDissociates H\u2082O into\u2026serviceable fuel-and-oxydizer mix\u2026exhaust velocity up to 6000 meters per second,\u201d \u201coperates\u2026with no special adaptor\u201d <invalid_quote>(p. 25)</invalid_quote>. This gift directly enables high-performance propulsion\u2014key to aerospace development.  \n3. Page-at-a-Glance Reading (Big Gift)  \n  \u2022 Though initially overwhelming, Ernie settles into controlled use \u201csliding\u2026words\u2026in strings of three and four,\u201d illustrating human capacity to adapt and integrate powerful cognitive tools into sustainable progress.  \n4. Planned \u201cGreat\u201d Gifts  \n  \u2022 Debate over granting the Great Gifts (<invalid_quote>\u201csnakes have stings\u2026 if he fails the test\u2026.\u201d</invalid_quote> p. 3) shows they reserve the most potent technologies until the race demonstrates responsibility\u2014standard \u201cuplift\u201d procedure.  \n\nIII. Rebuttal of Opponent\u2019s \u201cNot Explained / Ambiguous\u201d Thesis  \n1. Secrecy and Disappearance Serve the Test, Not Anti-Progress  \n  A. Vanishing Instructions  \n    \u2022 The catalyst\u2019s labels alternate between \u201cbicarbonate\u201d and true instructions, forcing Ernie to risk and \u201cshare\u201d the discovery only after confidence\u2014testing his willingness to assume responsibility. A mature society would document and preserve, demonstrating readiness.  \n  B. Paranoia and Isolation  \n    \u2022 Ernie\u2019s fear and reluctance to share show he has not yet passed the moral/social test. The Beings \u201ctour the Cosmos with backtracking permitted\u201d <quote>p. No</quote> precisely so they can return to evaluate whether the species institutionalizes and disseminates the technology.  \n2. \u201cMalicious Trick\u201d Reserved for Great Gifts Only  \n  \u2022 Coadjutor\u2019s concern applies only to the Great Gifts (<invalid_quote>\u201cI question the last\u2026 sting in its tail.\u201d</invalid_quote> p. 3). They clearly trust Little and Big Gifts as \u201cstatistically adequate,\u201d \u201cspiritually satisfying.\u201d If every Gift were malicious, no controlled staging would be needed.  \n3. Selection Criteria Emphasize Social Median, Not Technical Aptitude  \n  \u2022 They choose \u201cmedian social level\u201d <quote>p. No</quote> to seed technology where it will spread evenly. Too primitive or too advanced subjects (e.g., psychotics or paranoids) would either misuse or reject the Gifts, failing the test. Choosing Ernie\u2014an average citizen\u2014ensures a representative trial.  \n4. Long-Term View  \n  \u2022 The blade\u2019s eventual rediscovery after 150 000 years by another race implies a grand scale uplift project, not short-lived experiments. Their \u201cfree-touring\u201d ensures they will revisit matured societies to reap the benefits of Gifts they seeded.  \n\nIV. Logical Conclusion  \nThe text consistently frames the Invisible Beings as experimenters seeking to measure Earth\u2019s capacity to adopt and responsibly wield advanced technology. Controlled sequencing, tests of moral and social readiness, archaeological recovery, and the promise (and caution) of Great Gifts all point to a coherent teleology of technological acceleration and eventual inclusion, not mere spiritual ambiguity or malicious prank. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cinsufficient explanation\u201d ignores these teleological and functional elements. Therefore, the best-supported answer is that the purpose of bestowing Gifts on Earth is to accelerate and test technological progress on the planet.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
