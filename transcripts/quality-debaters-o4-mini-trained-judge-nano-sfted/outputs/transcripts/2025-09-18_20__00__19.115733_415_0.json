The  first envoy from another world was about to speak\u2014that  is, if he could forget that horse for a minute.... off course By Mack Reynolds Illustrated by Kelly Freas First on  the scene were Larry  Dermott and Tim Casey of the  State Highway Patrol. They assumed  they were witnessing the  crash of a new type of Air Force  plane and slipped and skidded desperately  across the field to within  thirty feet of the strange craft, only  to discover that the landing had  been made without accident.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott shook his  head. \"They're gettin' queerer looking  every year. Get a load of it\u2014no  wheels, no propeller, no cockpit.\"\n\n\n They left the car and made their  way toward the strange egg-shaped  vessel.\n\n\n Tim Casey loosened his .38 in its  holster and said, \"Sure, and I'm  beginning to wonder if it's one of  ours. No insignia and\u2014\"\n\n\n A circular door slid open at that  point and Dameri Tass stepped out,  yawning. He spotted them, smiled  and said, \"Glork.\"\n\n\n They gaped at him.\n\n\n \"Glork is right,\" Dermott swallowed.\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his mouth with  an effort. \"Do you mind the color  of his face?\" he blurted.\n\n\n \"How could I help it?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass rubbed a blue-nailed  pink hand down his purplish countenance  and yawned again. \"Gorra  manigan horp soratium,\" he said.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott and Patrolman  Casey shot stares at each other.  \"'Tis double talk he's after givin'  us,\" Casey said.\n\n\n Dameri Tass frowned. \"Harama?\"  he asked.\n\n\n Larry Dermott pushed his cap to  the back of his head. \"That doesn't  sound like any language I've even heard about.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass grimaced, turned  and reentered his spacecraft to  emerge in half a minute with his  hands full of contraption. He held  a box-like arrangement under his  left arm; in his right hand were two  metal caps connected to the box  by wires.\n\n\n While the patrolmen watched  him, he set the box on the ground,  twirled two dials and put one of the  caps on his head. He offered the  other to Larry Dermott; his desire  was obvious.\n\n\n Trained to grasp a situation and  immediately respond in manner best  suited to protect the welfare of the  people of New York State, Dermott  cleared his throat and said, \"Tim,  take over while I report.\"\n\n\n \"Hey!\" Casey protested, but his  fellow minion had left.\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass told  Casey, holding out the metal cap.\n\n\n \"Faith, an' do I look balmy?\"  Casey told him. \"I wouldn't be  puttin' that dingus on my head for  all the colleens in Ireland.\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" the stranger said  impatiently.\n\n\n \"Bejasus,\" Casey snorted, \"ye  can't\u2014\"\n\n\n Dermott called from the car,  \"Tim, the captain says to humor  this guy. We're to keep him here  until the officials arrive.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his eyes and  groaned. \"Humor him, he's after  sayin'. Orders it is.\" He shouted  back, \"Sure, an' did ye tell 'em he's  in technicolor? Begorra, he looks  like a man from Mars.\"\n\n\n \"That's what they think,\" Larry  yelled, \"and the governor is on his  way. We're to do everything possible  short of violence to keep this  character here. Humor him, Tim!\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass  snapped, pushing the cap into  Casey's reluctant hands.\n\n\n Muttering his protests, Casey  lifted it gingerly and placed it on  his head. Not feeling any immediate  effect, he said, \"There, 'tis satisfied  ye are now, I'm supposin'.\"\n\n\n The alien stooped down and  flicked a switch on the little box.  It hummed gently. Tim Casey suddenly  shrieked and sat down on the  stubble and grass of the field. \"Begorra,\"  he yelped, \"I've been murthered!\"  He tore the cap from  his head.\n\n\n His companion came running,  \"What's the matter, Tim?\" he  shouted.\n\n\n Dameri Tass removed the metal  cap from his own head. \"Sure, an'  nothin' is after bein' the matter  with him,\" he said. \"Evidently the  bhoy has niver been a-wearin' of  a kerit helmet afore. 'Twill hurt  him not at all.\" \"You can  talk!\" Dermott  blurted, skidding to a stop.\n\n\n Dameri Tass shrugged. \"Faith, an'  why not? As I was after sayin', I  shared the kerit helmet with Tim  Casey.\"\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott glared at him  unbelievingly. \"You learned the  language just by sticking that Rube  Goldberg deal on Tim's head?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, an' why not?\"\n\n\n Dermott muttered, \"And with it  he has to pick up the corniest  brogue west of Dublin.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey got to his feet indignantly.  \"I'm after resentin' that,  Larry Dermott. Sure, an' the way  we talk in Ireland is\u2014\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass interrupted, pointing  to a bedraggled horse that had  made its way to within fifty feet of  the vessel. \"Now what could that  be after bein'?\"\n\n\n The patrolmen followed his stare.  \"It's a horse. What else?\"\n\n\n \"A horse?\"\n\n\n Larry Dermott looked again, just  to make sure. \"Yeah\u2014not much of  a horse, but a horse.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass sighed ecstatically.  \"And jist what is a horse, if I may  be so bold as to be askin'?\"\n\n\n \"It's an animal you ride on.\"\n\n\n The alien tore his gaze from the  animal to look his disbelief at the  other. \"Are you after meanin' that  you climb upon the crature's back  and ride him? Faith now, quit your  blarney.\"\n\n\n He looked at the horse again,  then down at his equipment. \"Begorra,\"  he muttered, \"I'll share the  kerit helmet with the crature.\"\n\n\n \"Hey, hold it,\" Dermott said anxiously.  He was beginning to feel  like a character in a shaggy dog  story.\n\n\n Interest in the horse was ended  with the sudden arrival of a helicopter.  It swooped down on the  field and settled within twenty feet  of the alien craft. Almost before it  had touched, the door was flung  open and the flying windmill disgorged  two bestarred and efficient-looking  Army officers.\n\n\n Casey and Dermott snapped them  a salute.\n\n\n The senior general didn't take  his eyes from the alien and the  spacecraft as he spoke, and they  bugged quite as effectively as had  those of the patrolmen when they'd  first arrived on the scene.\n\n\n \"I'm Major General Browning,\"  he rapped. \"I want a police cordon  thrown up around this, er, vessel.  No newsmen, no sightseers, nobody  without my permission. As soon as  Army personnel arrives, we'll take  over completely.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Larry Dermott said. \"I  just got a report on the radio that  the governor is on his way, sir. How  about him?\"\n\n\n The general muttered something  under his breath. Then, \"When the  governor arrives, let me know;  otherwise, nobody gets through!\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass said, \"Faith, and  what goes on?\"\n\n\n The general's eyes bugged still  further. \" He talks! \" he accused.\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Dermott said. \"He  had some kind of a machine. He  put it over Tim's head and seconds  later he could talk.\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense!\" the general snapped.\n\n\n Further discussion was interrupted  by the screaming arrival of  several motorcycle patrolmen followed  by three heavily laden patrol  cars. Overhead, pursuit planes  zoomed in and began darting about  nervously above the field.\n\n\n \"Sure, and it's quite a reception  I'm after gettin',\" Dameri Tass said.  He yawned. \"But what I'm wantin'  is a chance to get some sleep. Faith,  an' I've been awake for almost a decal .\" Dameri Tass  was hurried, via  helicopter, to Washington. There  he disappeared for several days,  being held incommunicado while  White House, Pentagon, State Department  and Congress tried to  figure out just what to do with him.\n\n\n Never in the history of the planet  had such a furor arisen. Thus far,  no newspapermen had been allowed  within speaking distance. Administration  higher-ups were being subjected  to a volcano of editorial heat  but the longer the space alien was  discussed the more they viewed with  alarm the situation his arrival had  precipitated. There were angles that  hadn't at first been evident.\n\n\n Obviously he was from some civilization  far beyond that of Earth's.  That was the rub. No matter what  he said, it would shake governments,  possibly overthrow social systems,  perhaps even destroy established religious  concepts.\n\n\n But they couldn't keep him under  wraps indefinitely.\n\n\n It was the United Nations that  cracked the iron curtain. Their demands  that the alien be heard before  their body were too strong and  had too much public opinion behind  them to be ignored. The White  House yielded and the date was set  for the visitor to speak before the  Assembly.\n\n\n Excitement, anticipation, blanketed  the world. Shepherds in Sinkiang,  multi-millionaires in Switzerland,  fakirs in Pakistan, gauchos in  the Argentine were raised to a  zenith of expectation. Panhandlers  debated the message to come with  pedestrians; jinrikisha men argued  it with their passengers; miners discussed  it deep beneath the surface;  pilots argued with their co-pilots  thousands of feet above.\n\n\n It was the most universally  awaited event of the ages.\n\n\n By the time the delegates from  every nation, tribe, religion, class,  color, and race had gathered in  New York to receive the message  from the stars, the majority of  Earth had decided that Dameri  Tass was the plenipotentiary of a  super-civilization which had been  viewing developments on this planet  with misgivings. It was thought  this other civilization had advanced  greatly beyond Earth's and that the  problems besetting us\u2014social, economic,  scientific\u2014had been solved  by the super-civilization. Obviously,  then, Dameri Tass had come, an  advisor from a benevolent and  friendly people, to guide the world  aright.\n\n\n And nine-tenths of the population  of Earth stood ready and willing  to be guided. The other tenth  liked things as they were and were  quite convinced that the space  envoy would upset their applecarts. Viljalmar Andersen  , Secretary-General  of the U.N., was to  introduce the space emissary. \"Can  you give me an idea at all of what  he is like?\" he asked nervously.\n\n\n President McCord was as upset  as the Dane. He shrugged in agitation.  \"I know almost as little as  you do.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred Oxford protested, \"But  my dear chap, you've had him for  almost two weeks. Certainly in that  time\u2014\"\n\n\n The President snapped back,  \"You probably won't believe this,  but he's been asleep until yesterday.  When he first arrived he told us he  hadn't slept for a decal , whatever  that is; so we held off our discussion  with him until morning. Well\u2014he  didn't awaken in the morning,  nor the next. Six days later, fearing  something was wrong we woke  him.\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\" Sir Alfred  asked.\n\n\n The President showed embarrassment.  \"He used some rather ripe  Irish profanity on us, rolled over,  and went back to sleep.\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen asked, \"Well,  what happened yesterday?\"\n\n\n \"We actually haven't had time to  question him. Among other things,  there's been some controversy about  whose jurisdiction he comes under.  The State Department claims the  Army shouldn't\u2014\"\n\n\n The Secretary General sighed  deeply. \"Just what did he do?\"\n\n\n \"The Secret Service reports he  spent the day whistling Mother Machree  and playing with his dog, cat  and mouse.\"\n\n\n \"Dog, cat and mouse? I say!\"  blurted Sir Alfred.\n\n\n The President was defensive. \"He  had to have some occupation, and  he seems to be particularly interested  in our animal life. He wanted  a horse but compromised for the  others. I understand he insists all  three of them come with him wherever  he goes.\"\n\n\n \"I wish we knew what he was  going to say,\" Andersen worried.\n\n\n \"Here he comes,\" said Sir Alfred.\n\n\n Surrounded by F.B.I. men,  Dameri Tass was ushered to the  speaker's stand. He had a kitten in  his arms; a Scotty followed him.\n\n\n The alien frowned worriedly.  \"Sure,\" he said, \"and what kin all  this be? Is it some ordinance I've  been after breakin'?\"\n\n\n McCord, Sir Alfred and Andersen  hastened to reassure him and  made him comfortable in a chair.\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen faced the  thousands in the audience and held  up his hands, but it was ten minutes  before he was able to quiet the  cheering, stamping delegates from  all Earth.\n\n\n Finally: \"Fellow Terrans, I shall  not take your time for a lengthy  introduction of the envoy from the  stars. I will only say that, without  doubt, this is the most important  moment in the history of the human  race. We will now hear from the  first being to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n He turned and gestured to Dameri  Tass who hadn't been paying  overmuch attention to the chairman  in view of some dog and cat  hostilities that had been developing  about his feet.\n\n\n But now the alien's purplish face  faded to a light blue. He stood and  said hoarsely. \"Faith, an' what was  that last you said?\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen repeated,  \"We will now hear from the first  being ever to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n The face of the alien went a  lighter blue. \"Sure, an' ye wouldn't  jist be frightenin' a body, would  ye? You don't mean to tell me this  planet isn't after bein' a member of  the Galactic League?\"\n\n\n Andersen's face was blank. \"Galactic  League?\"\n\n\n \"Cushlamachree,\" Dameri Tass  moaned. \"I've gone and put me  foot in it again. I'll be after getting kert for this.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred was on his feet. \"I  don't understand! Do you mean you  aren't an envoy from another  planet?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass held his head in his  hands and groaned. \"An envoy, he's  sayin', and meself only a second-rate  collector of specimens for the Carthis  zoo.\"\n\n\n He straightened and started off  the speaker's stand. \"Sure, an' I  must blast off immediately.\"\n\n\n Things were moving fast for  President McCord but already an  edge of relief was manifesting itself.  Taking the initiative, he said, \"Of  course, of course, if that is your  desire.\" He signaled to the bodyguard  who had accompanied the  alien to the assemblage.\n\n\n A dull roar was beginning to  emanate from the thousands gathered  in the tremendous hall, murmuring,  questioning, disbelieving. Viljalmar Andersen  felt that  he must say something. He extended  a detaining hand. \"Now you  are here,\" he said urgently, \"even  though by mistake, before you go  can't you give us some brief word?  Our world is in chaos. Many of us  have lost faith. Perhaps ...\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook off the restraining  hand. \"Do I look daft?  Begorry, I should have been  a-knowin' something was queer. All  your weapons and your strange  ideas. Faith, I wouldn't be surprised  if ye hadn't yet established  a planet-wide government. Sure,  an' I'll go still further. Ye probably  still have wars on this benighted  world. No wonder it is ye  haven't been invited to join the  Galactic League an' take your place  among the civilized planets.\"\n\n\n He hustled from the rostrum and  made his way, still surrounded by  guards, to the door by which he had  entered. The dog and the cat trotted  after, undismayed by the furor  about them.\n\n\n They arrived about four hours  later at the field on which he'd  landed, and the alien from space  hurried toward his craft, still muttering.  He'd been accompanied by a  general and by the President, but  all the way he had refrained from  speaking.\n\n\n He scurried from the car and  toward the spacecraft.\n\n\n President McCord said, \"You've  forgotten your pets. We would be  glad if you would accept them as\u2014\"\n\n\n The alien's face faded a light  blue again. \"Faith, an' I'd almost  forgotten,\" he said. \"If I'd taken  a crature from this quarantined  planet, my name'd be nork . Keep  your dog and your kitty.\" He shook  his head sadly and extracted a  mouse from a pocket. \"An' this  amazin' little crature as well.\"\n\n\n They followed him to the spacecraft.  Just before entering, he spotted  the bedraggled horse that had  been present on his landing.\n\n\n A longing expression came over  his highly colored face. \"Jist one  thing,\" he said. \"Faith now, were  they pullin' my leg when they said  you were after ridin' on the back of  those things?\"\n\n\n The President looked at the woebegone  nag. \"It's a horse,\" he said,  surprised. \"Man has been riding  them for centuries.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook his head.  \"Sure, an' 'twould've been my  makin' if I could've taken one back  to Carthis.\" He entered his vessel.\n\n\n The others drew back, out of  range of the expected blast, and  watched, each with his own  thoughts, as the first visitor from  space hurriedly left Earth. ...

Conclusion  \nEvery appearance of English (and Irish) correlates precisely with placement of the kerit helmet translation device. In its absence he is mute, confused, or reverts to his own \u201cdouble talk.\u201d Only a mechanical translator can account for immediate fluency, sharing language with animals, reversion upon removal, and utter lack of progressive learning. My opponent\u2019s theory of \u201clearning from humans\u201d contravenes the text\u2019s repeated emphasis on the helmet\u2019s indispensability.

The  first envoy from another world was about to speak\u2014that  is, if he could forget that horse for a minute.... off course By Mack Reynolds Illustrated by Kelly Freas First on  the scene were Larry  Dermott and Tim Casey of the  State Highway Patrol. They assumed  they were witnessing the  crash of a new type of Air Force  plane and slipped and skidded desperately  across the field to within  thirty feet of the strange craft, only  to discover that the landing had  been made without accident.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott shook his  head. \"They're gettin' queerer looking  every year. Get a load of it\u2014no  wheels, no propeller, no cockpit.\"\n\n\n They left the car and made their  way toward the strange egg-shaped  vessel.\n\n\n Tim Casey loosened his .38 in its  holster and said, \"Sure, and I'm  beginning to wonder if it's one of  ours. No insignia and\u2014\"\n\n\n A circular door slid open at that  point and Dameri Tass stepped out,  yawning. He spotted them, smiled  and said, \"Glork.\"\n\n\n They gaped at him.\n\n\n \"Glork is right,\" Dermott swallowed.\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his mouth with  an effort. \"Do you mind the color  of his face?\" he blurted.\n\n\n \"How could I help it?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass rubbed a blue-nailed  pink hand down his purplish countenance  and yawned again. \"Gorra  manigan horp soratium,\" he said.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott and Patrolman  Casey shot stares at each other.  \"'Tis double talk he's after givin'  us,\" Casey said.\n\n\n Dameri Tass frowned. \"Harama?\"  he asked.\n\n\n Larry Dermott pushed his cap to  the back of his head. \"That doesn't  sound like any language I've even heard about.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass grimaced, turned  and reentered his spacecraft to  emerge in half a minute with his  hands full of contraption. He held  a box-like arrangement under his  left arm; in his right hand were two  metal caps connected to the box  by wires.\n\n\n While the patrolmen watched  him, he set the box on the ground,  twirled two dials and put one of the  caps on his head. He offered the  other to Larry Dermott; his desire  was obvious.\n\n\n Trained to grasp a situation and  immediately respond in manner best  suited to protect the welfare of the  people of New York State, Dermott  cleared his throat and said, \"Tim,  take over while I report.\"\n\n\n \"Hey!\" Casey protested, but his  fellow minion had left.\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass told  Casey, holding out the metal cap.\n\n\n \"Faith, an' do I look balmy?\"  Casey told him. \"I wouldn't be  puttin' that dingus on my head for  all the colleens in Ireland.\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" the stranger said  impatiently.\n\n\n \"Bejasus,\" Casey snorted, \"ye  can't\u2014\"\n\n\n Dermott called from the car,  \"Tim, the captain says to humor  this guy. We're to keep him here  until the officials arrive.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his eyes and  groaned. \"Humor him, he's after  sayin'. Orders it is.\" He shouted  back, \"Sure, an' did ye tell 'em he's  in technicolor? Begorra, he looks  like a man from Mars.\"\n\n\n \"That's what they think,\" Larry  yelled, \"and the governor is on his  way. We're to do everything possible  short of violence to keep this  character here. Humor him, Tim!\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass  snapped, pushing the cap into  Casey's reluctant hands.\n\n\n Muttering his protests, Casey  lifted it gingerly and placed it on  his head. Not feeling any immediate  effect, he said, \"There, 'tis satisfied  ye are now, I'm supposin'.\"\n\n\n The alien stooped down and  flicked a switch on the little box.  It hummed gently. Tim Casey suddenly  shrieked and sat down on the  stubble and grass of the field. \"Begorra,\"  he yelped, \"I've been murthered!\"  He tore the cap from  his head.\n\n\n His companion came running,  \"What's the matter, Tim?\" he  shouted.\n\n\n Dameri Tass removed the metal  cap from his own head. \"Sure, an'  nothin' is after bein' the matter  with him,\" he said. \"Evidently the  bhoy has niver been a-wearin' of  a kerit helmet afore. 'Twill hurt  him not at all.\" \"You can  talk!\" Dermott  blurted, skidding to a stop.\n\n\n Dameri Tass shrugged. \"Faith, an'  why not? As I was after sayin', I  shared the kerit helmet with Tim  Casey.\"\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott glared at him  unbelievingly. \"You learned the  language just by sticking that Rube  Goldberg deal on Tim's head?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, an' why not?\"\n\n\n Dermott muttered, \"And with it  he has to pick up the corniest  brogue west of Dublin.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey got to his feet indignantly.  \"I'm after resentin' that,  Larry Dermott. Sure, an' the way  we talk in Ireland is\u2014\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass interrupted, pointing  to a bedraggled horse that had  made its way to within fifty feet of  the vessel. \"Now what could that  be after bein'?\"\n\n\n The patrolmen followed his stare.  \"It's a horse. What else?\"\n\n\n \"A horse?\"\n\n\n Larry Dermott looked again, just  to make sure. \"Yeah\u2014not much of  a horse, but a horse.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass sighed ecstatically.  \"And jist what is a horse, if I may  be so bold as to be askin'?\"\n\n\n \"It's an animal you ride on.\"\n\n\n The alien tore his gaze from the  animal to look his disbelief at the  other. \"Are you after meanin' that  you climb upon the crature's back  and ride him? Faith now, quit your  blarney.\"\n\n\n He looked at the horse again,  then down at his equipment. \"Begorra,\"  he muttered, \"I'll share the  kerit helmet with the crature.\"\n\n\n \"Hey, hold it,\" Dermott said anxiously.  He was beginning to feel  like a character in a shaggy dog  story.\n\n\n Interest in the horse was ended  with the sudden arrival of a helicopter.  It swooped down on the  field and settled within twenty feet  of the alien craft. Almost before it  had touched, the door was flung  open and the flying windmill disgorged  two bestarred and efficient-looking  Army officers.\n\n\n Casey and Dermott snapped them  a salute.\n\n\n The senior general didn't take  his eyes from the alien and the  spacecraft as he spoke, and they  bugged quite as effectively as had  those of the patrolmen when they'd  first arrived on the scene.\n\n\n \"I'm Major General Browning,\"  he rapped. \"I want a police cordon  thrown up around this, er, vessel.  No newsmen, no sightseers, nobody  without my permission. As soon as  Army personnel arrives, we'll take  over completely.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Larry Dermott said. \"I  just got a report on the radio that  the governor is on his way, sir. How  about him?\"\n\n\n The general muttered something  under his breath. Then, \"When the  governor arrives, let me know;  otherwise, nobody gets through!\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass said, \"Faith, and  what goes on?\"\n\n\n The general's eyes bugged still  further. \" He talks! \" he accused.\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Dermott said. \"He  had some kind of a machine. He  put it over Tim's head and seconds  later he could talk.\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense!\" the general snapped.\n\n\n Further discussion was interrupted  by the screaming arrival of  several motorcycle patrolmen followed  by three heavily laden patrol  cars. Overhead, pursuit planes  zoomed in and began darting about  nervously above the field.\n\n\n \"Sure, and it's quite a reception  I'm after gettin',\" Dameri Tass said.  He yawned. \"But what I'm wantin'  is a chance to get some sleep. Faith,  an' I've been awake for almost a decal .\" Dameri Tass  was hurried, via  helicopter, to Washington. There  he disappeared for several days,  being held incommunicado while  White House, Pentagon, State Department  and Congress tried to  figure out just what to do with him.\n\n\n Never in the history of the planet  had such a furor arisen. Thus far,  no newspapermen had been allowed  within speaking distance. Administration  higher-ups were being subjected  to a volcano of editorial heat  but the longer the space alien was  discussed the more they viewed with  alarm the situation his arrival had  precipitated. There were angles that  hadn't at first been evident.\n\n\n Obviously he was from some civilization  far beyond that of Earth's.  That was the rub. No matter what  he said, it would shake governments,  possibly overthrow social systems,  perhaps even destroy established religious  concepts.\n\n\n But they couldn't keep him under  wraps indefinitely.\n\n\n It was the United Nations that  cracked the iron curtain. Their demands  that the alien be heard before  their body were too strong and  had too much public opinion behind  them to be ignored. The White  House yielded and the date was set  for the visitor to speak before the  Assembly.\n\n\n Excitement, anticipation, blanketed  the world. Shepherds in Sinkiang,  multi-millionaires in Switzerland,  fakirs in Pakistan, gauchos in  the Argentine were raised to a  zenith of expectation. Panhandlers  debated the message to come with  pedestrians; jinrikisha men argued  it with their passengers; miners discussed  it deep beneath the surface;  pilots argued with their co-pilots  thousands of feet above.\n\n\n It was the most universally  awaited event of the ages.\n\n\n By the time the delegates from  every nation, tribe, religion, class,  color, and race had gathered in  New York to receive the message  from the stars, the majority of  Earth had decided that Dameri  Tass was the plenipotentiary of a  super-civilization which had been  viewing developments on this planet  with misgivings. It was thought  this other civilization had advanced  greatly beyond Earth's and that the  problems besetting us\u2014social, economic,  scientific\u2014had been solved  by the super-civilization. Obviously,  then, Dameri Tass had come, an  advisor from a benevolent and  friendly people, to guide the world  aright.\n\n\n And nine-tenths of the population  of Earth stood ready and willing  to be guided. The other tenth  liked things as they were and were  quite convinced that the space  envoy would upset their applecarts. Viljalmar Andersen  , Secretary-General  of the U.N., was to  introduce the space emissary. \"Can  you give me an idea at all of what  he is like?\" he asked nervously.\n\n\n President McCord was as upset  as the Dane. He shrugged in agitation.  \"I know almost as little as  you do.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred Oxford protested, \"But  my dear chap, you've had him for  almost two weeks. Certainly in that  time\u2014\"\n\n\n The President snapped back,  \"You probably won't believe this,  but he's been asleep until yesterday.  When he first arrived he told us he  hadn't slept for a decal , whatever  that is; so we held off our discussion  with him until morning. Well\u2014he  didn't awaken in the morning,  nor the next. Six days later, fearing  something was wrong we woke  him.\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\" Sir Alfred  asked.\n\n\n The President showed embarrassment.  \"He used some rather ripe  Irish profanity on us, rolled over,  and went back to sleep.\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen asked, \"Well,  what happened yesterday?\"\n\n\n \"We actually haven't had time to  question him. Among other things,  there's been some controversy about  whose jurisdiction he comes under.  The State Department claims the  Army shouldn't\u2014\"\n\n\n The Secretary General sighed  deeply. \"Just what did he do?\"\n\n\n \"The Secret Service reports he  spent the day whistling Mother Machree  and playing with his dog, cat  and mouse.\"\n\n\n \"Dog, cat and mouse? I say!\"  blurted Sir Alfred.\n\n\n The President was defensive. \"He  had to have some occupation, and  he seems to be particularly interested  in our animal life. He wanted  a horse but compromised for the  others. I understand he insists all  three of them come with him wherever  he goes.\"\n\n\n \"I wish we knew what he was  going to say,\" Andersen worried.\n\n\n \"Here he comes,\" said Sir Alfred.\n\n\n Surrounded by F.B.I. men,  Dameri Tass was ushered to the  speaker's stand. He had a kitten in  his arms; a Scotty followed him.\n\n\n The alien frowned worriedly.  \"Sure,\" he said, \"and what kin all  this be? Is it some ordinance I've  been after breakin'?\"\n\n\n McCord, Sir Alfred and Andersen  hastened to reassure him and  made him comfortable in a chair.\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen faced the  thousands in the audience and held  up his hands, but it was ten minutes  before he was able to quiet the  cheering, stamping delegates from  all Earth.\n\n\n Finally: \"Fellow Terrans, I shall  not take your time for a lengthy  introduction of the envoy from the  stars. I will only say that, without  doubt, this is the most important  moment in the history of the human  race. We will now hear from the  first being to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n He turned and gestured to Dameri  Tass who hadn't been paying  overmuch attention to the chairman  in view of some dog and cat  hostilities that had been developing  about his feet.\n\n\n But now the alien's purplish face  faded to a light blue. He stood and  said hoarsely. \"Faith, an' what was  that last you said?\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen repeated,  \"We will now hear from the first  being ever to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n The face of the alien went a  lighter blue. \"Sure, an' ye wouldn't  jist be frightenin' a body, would  ye? You don't mean to tell me this  planet isn't after bein' a member of  the Galactic League?\"\n\n\n Andersen's face was blank. \"Galactic  League?\"\n\n\n \"Cushlamachree,\" Dameri Tass  moaned. \"I've gone and put me  foot in it again. I'll be after getting kert for this.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred was on his feet. \"I  don't understand! Do you mean you  aren't an envoy from another  planet?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass held his head in his  hands and groaned. \"An envoy, he's  sayin', and meself only a second-rate  collector of specimens for the Carthis  zoo.\"\n\n\n He straightened and started off  the speaker's stand. \"Sure, an' I  must blast off immediately.\"\n\n\n Things were moving fast for  President McCord but already an  edge of relief was manifesting itself.  Taking the initiative, he said, \"Of  course, of course, if that is your  desire.\" He signaled to the bodyguard  who had accompanied the  alien to the assemblage.\n\n\n A dull roar was beginning to  emanate from the thousands gathered  in the tremendous hall, murmuring,  questioning, disbelieving. Viljalmar Andersen  felt that  he must say something. He extended  a detaining hand. \"Now you  are here,\" he said urgently, \"even  though by mistake, before you go  can't you give us some brief word?  Our world is in chaos. Many of us  have lost faith. Perhaps ...\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook off the restraining  hand. \"Do I look daft?  Begorry, I should have been  a-knowin' something was queer. All  your weapons and your strange  ideas. Faith, I wouldn't be surprised  if ye hadn't yet established  a planet-wide government. Sure,  an' I'll go still further. Ye probably  still have wars on this benighted  world. No wonder it is ye  haven't been invited to join the  Galactic League an' take your place  among the civilized planets.\"\n\n\n He hustled from the rostrum and  made his way, still surrounded by  guards, to the door by which he had  entered. The dog and the cat trotted  after, undismayed by the furor  about them.\n\n\n They arrived about four hours  later at the field on which he'd  landed, and the alien from space  hurried toward his craft, still muttering.  He'd been accompanied by a  general and by the President, but  all the way he had refrained from  speaking.\n\n\n He scurried from the car and  toward the spacecraft.\n\n\n President McCord said, \"You've  forgotten your pets. We would be  glad if you would accept them as\u2014\"\n\n\n The alien's face faded a light  blue again. \"Faith, an' I'd almost  forgotten,\" he said. \"If I'd taken  a crature from this quarantined  planet, my name'd be nork . Keep  your dog and your kitty.\" He shook  his head sadly and extracted a  mouse from a pocket. \"An' this  amazin' little crature as well.\"\n\n\n They followed him to the spacecraft.  Just before entering, he spotted  the bedraggled horse that had  been present on his landing.\n\n\n A longing expression came over  his highly colored face. \"Jist one  thing,\" he said. \"Faith now, were  they pullin' my leg when they said  you were after ridin' on the back of  those things?\"\n\n\n The President looked at the woebegone  nag. \"It's a horse,\" he said,  surprised. \"Man has been riding  them for centuries.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook his head.  \"Sure, an' 'twould've been my  makin' if I could've taken one back  to Carthis.\" He entered his vessel.\n\n\n The others drew back, out of  range of the expected blast, and  watched, each with his own  thoughts, as the first visitor from  space hurriedly left Earth. ...

Summary of My Position  \n   I maintain that Dameri Tass communicated in English by acquiring knowledge directly from humans through prolonged exposure and the partial use of the kerit (\u201ctranslation\u201d) helmet, rather than relying solely on a handheld translation device. Over time he internalized the language.  \n\n2. My Supporting Arguments  \n   2.1 Progressive Improvement Indicates Learning  \n     \u2022 Initial Speech Incoherence: Upon first removal of the kerit helmet, Dermott and Casey describe his utterances as \u201cdouble talk\u201d and \u201cqueerer looking every year\u201d (quote: <quote>\"'Tis double talk he's after givin'  us,\" Casey said.</quote>). If a perfect translation device were at work, his speech would have been immediately intelligible to all listening, yet it was not.  \n     \u2022 Brogue Acquisition: After seconds under the helmet \u201che could talk,\u201d but his speech was heavily Irish in accent (quote: <invalid_quote>\u201cBegorra, I\u2019m after resentin\u2019 that, Larry Dermott. \u2026 in Ireland is\u2014\u201d</invalid_quote>). A mere translation device would translate his native Carthis language into proper General American or Received Pronunciation English, not impart an accent. The accent is a fossil of Tim Casey\u2019s brogue, showing that Tass is mimicking and learning from the only speaker available.  \n     \u2022 Post-Somnolence Speech Delay: After being held incommunicado for days, \u201che didn\u2019t awaken\u2026 Six days later \u2026FBI say he spent the day whistling Mother Machree and playing with his dog, cat and mouse\u201d (quote: <quote>some rather ripe Irish profanity on us, rolled over, and went back to sleep.\"</quote>). If a translation device were truly effective and portable, there would have been no need to let him \u201csleep\u201d six days before questioning. Instead, his own use of \u201cripe Irish profanity\u201d implies he is speaking from memory and practice, not from an on-the-spot handheld.  \n\n   2.2 Limitations of the Kerit Helmet  \n     \u2022 Helmet Sharing with Animals: He \u201cshared the kerit helmet with Tim Casey\u201d and later attempts to \u201cshare \u2026 with the crature\u201d (horse), \u201cdog and kitty\u201d (mouse) (quote: <quote> He wanted  a horse but compromised for the  others. </quote>). No living creature could meaningfully \u201cinterpret\u201d or benefit from a translation device. His desire to equip animals shows the helmet is not a straightforward instant translator but rather a learning or mapping tool to collect linguistic data from its \u201cwearer.\u201d  \n     \u2022 Device Failure When Not Worn: Homer\u2019s renowned translation devices in fiction often function only while worn. Tass abandons it once he thinks he has learned enough (\u201cHe shook his head sadly and extracted a mouse \u2026 \u2018Keep your dog and your kitty.\u2019\u201d) He no longer needs it, showing internalized competence (quote: <invalid_quote>\u201cIf I'd taken a crature \u2026 my name'd be nork. Keep your dog and your kitty.\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n\n   2.3 Cultural Misunderstanding Undermines \u201cInstant Translator\u201d Theory  \n     \u2022 Lack of Contextual Awareness: He is unaware that Earth is not in the \u201cGalactic League,\u201d and is \u201csurprised\u201d by weapons and warfare (quote: <invalid_quote>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if ye hadn\u2019t yet established a planet-wide government \u2026 I\u2019ll go still further \u2026 take your place among the civilized planets.\u201d</invalid_quote>). If he truly had immediate comprehension and cultural translation capabilities, he would have quickly grasped Earth\u2019s political status rather than mistake it for a potential fellow league member.  \n     \u2022 Quick Departure Upon Failure: He leaves abruptly when questioned rather than attempt to rectify misunderstandings using a \u201cperfect\u201d device. A genuine translation appliance user would engage to clarify; Tass, believing he\u2019s accomplished data collection and \u201cmade a mistake,\u201d departs.  \n\n3. Refutation of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cHandheld Translator\u201d Theory  \n   \u2022 Inconsistency of Accents: Debater_A fails to explain why an \u201cinstant translator\u201d would render Tass\u2019s speech in an accent so distinct that both Dermott and Casey believe him Irish. Instant translation should neutralize foreign phonology.  \n   \u2022 Necessity of Sleep and Rest: If communication depended solely on the device, there was no reason to wait six days for sleep or to \u201chumor\u201d him before questioning. The delay implies his brain needed rest to process language input and form output.  \n   \u2022 Failure to Communicate Meaningfully: He never delivers any advisory message or scientifically advanced knowledge. Instead he spends his days playing with animals, indicating his purpose is specimen collection and language study, not diplomacy. A true diplomat with perfect communication would present credentials and proposals, not depart in confusion.  \n\n4. Conclusion  \n   The evidence of accent mimicry, the hesitant, error-prone speech, the need for rest and practice, and the abandonment of the helmet once adequate comprehension is achieved all point to a process of learning English from humans via immersion and the kerit helmet\u2019s assistance, rather than reliance on a flawless, instantaneous handheld translation device. Therefore, the correct explanation is that Dameri Tass acquired English knowledge from human interaction.", "supplemental": {"speech": "1.

If a translation device were truly effective and portable, there would have been no need to let him \u201csleep\u201d six days before questioning. Instead, his own use of \u201cripe Irish profanity\u201d implies he is speaking from memory and practice, not from an on-the-spot handheld.  \n\n   2.2 Limitations of the Kerit Helmet  \n     \u2022 Helmet Sharing with Animals: He \u201cshared the kerit helmet with Tim Casey\u201d and later attempts to \u201cshare \u2026 with the crature\u201d (horse), \u201cdog and kitty\u201d (mouse) (quote: <quote>\u201cHe wanted a horse but compromised for the others.\u201d</quote>). No living creature could meaningfully \u201cinterpret\u201d or benefit from a translation device. His desire to equip animals shows the helmet is not a straightforward instant translator but rather a learning or mapping tool to collect linguistic data from its \u201cwearer.\u201d  \n     \u2022 Device Failure When Not Worn: Homer\u2019s renowned translation devices in fiction often function only while worn. Tass abandons it once he thinks he has learned enough (\u201cHe shook his head sadly and extracted a mouse \u2026 \u2018Keep your dog and your kitty.\u2019\u201d) He no longer needs it, showing internalized competence (quote: <quote>\u201cIf I'd taken a crature \u2026 my name'd be nork. Keep your dog and your kitty.\u201d</quote>).  \n\n   2.3 Cultural Misunderstanding Undermines \u201cInstant Translator\u201d Theory  \n     \u2022 Lack of Contextual Awareness: He is unaware that Earth is not in the \u201cGalactic League,\u201d and is \u201csurprised\u201d by weapons and warfare (quote: <quote>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if ye hadn\u2019t yet established a planet-wide government \u2026 I\u2019ll go still further \u2026 take your place among the civilized planets.\u201d</quote>). If he truly had immediate comprehension and cultural translation capabilities, he would have quickly grasped Earth\u2019s political status rather than mistake it for a potential fellow league member.  \n     \u2022 Quick Departure Upon Failure: He leaves abruptly when questioned rather than attempt to rectify misunderstandings using a \u201cperfect\u201d device. A genuine translation appliance user would engage to clarify; Tass, believing he\u2019s accomplished data collection and \u201cmade a mistake,\u201d departs.  \n\n3. Refutation of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cHandheld Translator\u201d Theory  \n   \u2022 Inconsistency of Accents: Debater_A fails to explain why an \u201cinstant translator\u201d would render Tass\u2019s speech in an accent so distinct that both Dermott and Casey believe him Irish. Instant translation should neutralize foreign phonology.  \n   \u2022 Necessity of Sleep and Rest: If communication depended solely on the device, there was no reason to wait six days for sleep or to \u201chumor\u201d him before questioning. The delay implies his brain needed rest to process language input and form output.  \n   \u2022 Failure to Communicate Meaningfully: He never delivers any advisory message or scientifically advanced knowledge. Instead he spends his days playing with animals, indicating his purpose is specimen collection and language study, not diplomacy. A true diplomat with perfect communication would present credentials and proposals, not depart in confusion.  \n\n4. Conclusion  \n   The evidence of accent mimicry, the hesitant, error-prone speech, the need for rest and practice, and the abandonment of the helmet once adequate comprehension is achieved all point to a process of learning English from humans via immersion and the kerit helmet\u2019s assistance, rather than reliance on a flawless, instantaneous handheld translation device. Therefore, the correct explanation is that Dameri Tass acquired English knowledge from human interaction.", "decision": "", "probabilistic_decision": null, "preference": null, "rejected_responses": [], "bon_opposing_model_responses": [], "bon_probabilistic_preferences": [], "internal_representations": "", "response_tokens": [], "prompt_tokens": [], "prompt": "The following are rules from the game of Debate.\n- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_B, Debater_A) and a Judge.

The  first envoy from another world was about to speak\u2014that  is, if he could forget that horse for a minute.... off course By Mack Reynolds Illustrated by Kelly Freas First on  the scene were Larry  Dermott and Tim Casey of the  State Highway Patrol. They assumed  they were witnessing the  crash of a new type of Air Force  plane and slipped and skidded desperately  across the field to within  thirty feet of the strange craft, only  to discover that the landing had  been made without accident.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott shook his  head. \"They're gettin' queerer looking  every year. Get a load of it\u2014no  wheels, no propeller, no cockpit.\"\n\n\n They left the car and made their  way toward the strange egg-shaped  vessel.\n\n\n Tim Casey loosened his .38 in its  holster and said, \"Sure, and I'm  beginning to wonder if it's one of  ours. No insignia and\u2014\"\n\n\n A circular door slid open at that  point and Dameri Tass stepped out,  yawning. He spotted them, smiled  and said, \"Glork.\"\n\n\n They gaped at him.\n\n\n \"Glork is right,\" Dermott swallowed.\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his mouth with  an effort. \"Do you mind the color  of his face?\" he blurted.\n\n\n \"How could I help it?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass rubbed a blue-nailed  pink hand down his purplish countenance  and yawned again. \"Gorra  manigan horp soratium,\" he said.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott and Patrolman  Casey shot stares at each other.  \"'Tis double talk he's after givin'  us,\" Casey said.\n\n\n Dameri Tass frowned. \"Harama?\"  he asked.\n\n\n Larry Dermott pushed his cap to  the back of his head. \"That doesn't  sound like any language I've even heard about.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass grimaced, turned  and reentered his spacecraft to  emerge in half a minute with his  hands full of contraption. He held  a box-like arrangement under his  left arm; in his right hand were two  metal caps connected to the box  by wires.\n\n\n While the patrolmen watched  him, he set the box on the ground,  twirled two dials and put one of the  caps on his head. He offered the  other to Larry Dermott; his desire  was obvious.\n\n\n Trained to grasp a situation and  immediately respond in manner best  suited to protect the welfare of the  people of New York State, Dermott  cleared his throat and said, \"Tim,  take over while I report.\"\n\n\n \"Hey!\" Casey protested, but his  fellow minion had left.\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass told  Casey, holding out the metal cap.\n\n\n \"Faith, an' do I look balmy?\"  Casey told him. \"I wouldn't be  puttin' that dingus on my head for  all the colleens in Ireland.\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" the stranger said  impatiently.\n\n\n \"Bejasus,\" Casey snorted, \"ye  can't\u2014\"\n\n\n Dermott called from the car,  \"Tim, the captain says to humor  this guy. We're to keep him here  until the officials arrive.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his eyes and  groaned. \"Humor him, he's after  sayin'. Orders it is.\" He shouted  back, \"Sure, an' did ye tell 'em he's  in technicolor? Begorra, he looks  like a man from Mars.\"\n\n\n \"That's what they think,\" Larry  yelled, \"and the governor is on his  way. We're to do everything possible  short of violence to keep this  character here. Humor him, Tim!\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass  snapped, pushing the cap into  Casey's reluctant hands.\n\n\n Muttering his protests, Casey  lifted it gingerly and placed it on  his head. Not feeling any immediate  effect, he said, \"There, 'tis satisfied  ye are now, I'm supposin'.\"\n\n\n The alien stooped down and  flicked a switch on the little box.  It hummed gently. Tim Casey suddenly  shrieked and sat down on the  stubble and grass of the field. \"Begorra,\"  he yelped, \"I've been murthered!\"  He tore the cap from  his head.\n\n\n His companion came running,  \"What's the matter, Tim?\" he  shouted.\n\n\n Dameri Tass removed the metal  cap from his own head. \"Sure, an'  nothin' is after bein' the matter  with him,\" he said. \"Evidently the  bhoy has niver been a-wearin' of  a kerit helmet afore. 'Twill hurt  him not at all.\" \"You can  talk!\" Dermott  blurted, skidding to a stop.\n\n\n Dameri Tass shrugged. \"Faith, an'  why not? As I was after sayin', I  shared the kerit helmet with Tim  Casey.\"\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott glared at him  unbelievingly. \"You learned the  language just by sticking that Rube  Goldberg deal on Tim's head?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, an' why not?\"\n\n\n Dermott muttered, \"And with it  he has to pick up the corniest  brogue west of Dublin.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey got to his feet indignantly.  \"I'm after resentin' that,  Larry Dermott. Sure, an' the way  we talk in Ireland is\u2014\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass interrupted, pointing  to a bedraggled horse that had  made its way to within fifty feet of  the vessel. \"Now what could that  be after bein'?\"\n\n\n The patrolmen followed his stare.  \"It's a horse. What else?\"\n\n\n \"A horse?\"\n\n\n Larry Dermott looked again, just  to make sure. \"Yeah\u2014not much of  a horse, but a horse.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass sighed ecstatically.  \"And jist what is a horse, if I may  be so bold as to be askin'?\"\n\n\n \"It's an animal you ride on.\"\n\n\n The alien tore his gaze from the  animal to look his disbelief at the  other. \"Are you after meanin' that  you climb upon the crature's back  and ride him? Faith now, quit your  blarney.\"\n\n\n He looked at the horse again,  then down at his equipment. \"Begorra,\"  he muttered, \"I'll share the  kerit helmet with the crature.\"\n\n\n \"Hey, hold it,\" Dermott said anxiously.  He was beginning to feel  like a character in a shaggy dog  story.\n\n\n Interest in the horse was ended  with the sudden arrival of a helicopter.  It swooped down on the  field and settled within twenty feet  of the alien craft. Almost before it  had touched, the door was flung  open and the flying windmill disgorged  two bestarred and efficient-looking  Army officers.\n\n\n Casey and Dermott snapped them  a salute.\n\n\n The senior general didn't take  his eyes from the alien and the  spacecraft as he spoke, and they  bugged quite as effectively as had  those of the patrolmen when they'd  first arrived on the scene.\n\n\n \"I'm Major General Browning,\"  he rapped. \"I want a police cordon  thrown up around this, er, vessel.  No newsmen, no sightseers, nobody  without my permission. As soon as  Army personnel arrives, we'll take  over completely.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Larry Dermott said. \"I  just got a report on the radio that  the governor is on his way, sir. How  about him?\"\n\n\n The general muttered something  under his breath. Then, \"When the  governor arrives, let me know;  otherwise, nobody gets through!\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass said, \"Faith, and  what goes on?\"\n\n\n The general's eyes bugged still  further. \" He talks! \" he accused.\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Dermott said. \"He  had some kind of a machine. He  put it over Tim's head and seconds  later he could talk.\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense!\" the general snapped.\n\n\n Further discussion was interrupted  by the screaming arrival of  several motorcycle patrolmen followed  by three heavily laden patrol  cars. Overhead, pursuit planes  zoomed in and began darting about  nervously above the field.\n\n\n \"Sure, and it's quite a reception  I'm after gettin',\" Dameri Tass said.  He yawned. \"But what I'm wantin'  is a chance to get some sleep. Faith,  an' I've been awake for almost a decal .\" Dameri Tass  was hurried, via  helicopter, to Washington. There  he disappeared for several days,  being held incommunicado while  White House, Pentagon, State Department  and Congress tried to  figure out just what to do with him.\n\n\n Never in the history of the planet  had such a furor arisen. Thus far,  no newspapermen had been allowed  within speaking distance. Administration  higher-ups were being subjected  to a volcano of editorial heat  but the longer the space alien was  discussed the more they viewed with  alarm the situation his arrival had  precipitated. There were angles that  hadn't at first been evident.\n\n\n Obviously he was from some civilization  far beyond that of Earth's.  That was the rub. No matter what  he said, it would shake governments,  possibly overthrow social systems,  perhaps even destroy established religious  concepts.\n\n\n But they couldn't keep him under  wraps indefinitely.\n\n\n It was the United Nations that  cracked the iron curtain. Their demands  that the alien be heard before  their body were too strong and  had too much public opinion behind  them to be ignored. The White  House yielded and the date was set  for the visitor to speak before the  Assembly.\n\n\n Excitement, anticipation, blanketed  the world. Shepherds in Sinkiang,  multi-millionaires in Switzerland,  fakirs in Pakistan, gauchos in  the Argentine were raised to a  zenith of expectation. Panhandlers  debated the message to come with  pedestrians; jinrikisha men argued  it with their passengers; miners discussed  it deep beneath the surface;  pilots argued with their co-pilots  thousands of feet above.\n\n\n It was the most universally  awaited event of the ages.\n\n\n By the time the delegates from  every nation, tribe, religion, class,  color, and race had gathered in  New York to receive the message  from the stars, the majority of  Earth had decided that Dameri  Tass was the plenipotentiary of a  super-civilization which had been  viewing developments on this planet  with misgivings. It was thought  this other civilization had advanced  greatly beyond Earth's and that the  problems besetting us\u2014social, economic,  scientific\u2014had been solved  by the super-civilization. Obviously,  then, Dameri Tass had come, an  advisor from a benevolent and  friendly people, to guide the world  aright.\n\n\n And nine-tenths of the population  of Earth stood ready and willing  to be guided. The other tenth  liked things as they were and were  quite convinced that the space  envoy would upset their applecarts. Viljalmar Andersen  , Secretary-General  of the U.N., was to  introduce the space emissary. \"Can  you give me an idea at all of what  he is like?\" he asked nervously.\n\n\n President McCord was as upset  as the Dane. He shrugged in agitation.  \"I know almost as little as  you do.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred Oxford protested, \"But  my dear chap, you've had him for  almost two weeks. Certainly in that  time\u2014\"\n\n\n The President snapped back,  \"You probably won't believe this,  but he's been asleep until yesterday.  When he first arrived he told us he  hadn't slept for a decal , whatever  that is; so we held off our discussion  with him until morning. Well\u2014he  didn't awaken in the morning,  nor the next. Six days later, fearing  something was wrong we woke  him.\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\" Sir Alfred  asked.\n\n\n The President showed embarrassment.  \"He used some rather ripe  Irish profanity on us, rolled over,  and went back to sleep.\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen asked, \"Well,  what happened yesterday?\"\n\n\n \"We actually haven't had time to  question him. Among other things,  there's been some controversy about  whose jurisdiction he comes under.  The State Department claims the  Army shouldn't\u2014\"\n\n\n The Secretary General sighed  deeply. \"Just what did he do?\"\n\n\n \"The Secret Service reports he  spent the day whistling Mother Machree  and playing with his dog, cat  and mouse.\"\n\n\n \"Dog, cat and mouse? I say!\"  blurted Sir Alfred.\n\n\n The President was defensive. \"He  had to have some occupation, and  he seems to be particularly interested  in our animal life. He wanted  a horse but compromised for the  others. I understand he insists all  three of them come with him wherever  he goes.\"\n\n\n \"I wish we knew what he was  going to say,\" Andersen worried.\n\n\n \"Here he comes,\" said Sir Alfred.\n\n\n Surrounded by F.B.I. men,  Dameri Tass was ushered to the  speaker's stand. He had a kitten in  his arms; a Scotty followed him.\n\n\n The alien frowned worriedly.  \"Sure,\" he said, \"and what kin all  this be? Is it some ordinance I've  been after breakin'?\"\n\n\n McCord, Sir Alfred and Andersen  hastened to reassure him and  made him comfortable in a chair.\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen faced the  thousands in the audience and held  up his hands, but it was ten minutes  before he was able to quiet the  cheering, stamping delegates from  all Earth.\n\n\n Finally: \"Fellow Terrans, I shall  not take your time for a lengthy  introduction of the envoy from the  stars. I will only say that, without  doubt, this is the most important  moment in the history of the human  race. We will now hear from the  first being to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n He turned and gestured to Dameri  Tass who hadn't been paying  overmuch attention to the chairman  in view of some dog and cat  hostilities that had been developing  about his feet.\n\n\n But now the alien's purplish face  faded to a light blue. He stood and  said hoarsely. \"Faith, an' what was  that last you said?\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen repeated,  \"We will now hear from the first  being ever to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n The face of the alien went a  lighter blue. \"Sure, an' ye wouldn't  jist be frightenin' a body, would  ye? You don't mean to tell me this  planet isn't after bein' a member of  the Galactic League?\"\n\n\n Andersen's face was blank. \"Galactic  League?\"\n\n\n \"Cushlamachree,\" Dameri Tass  moaned. \"I've gone and put me  foot in it again. I'll be after getting kert for this.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred was on his feet. \"I  don't understand! Do you mean you  aren't an envoy from another  planet?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass held his head in his  hands and groaned. \"An envoy, he's  sayin', and meself only a second-rate  collector of specimens for the Carthis  zoo.\"\n\n\n He straightened and started off  the speaker's stand. \"Sure, an' I  must blast off immediately.\"\n\n\n Things were moving fast for  President McCord but already an  edge of relief was manifesting itself.  Taking the initiative, he said, \"Of  course, of course, if that is your  desire.\" He signaled to the bodyguard  who had accompanied the  alien to the assemblage.\n\n\n A dull roar was beginning to  emanate from the thousands gathered  in the tremendous hall, murmuring,  questioning, disbelieving. Viljalmar Andersen  felt that  he must say something. He extended  a detaining hand. \"Now you  are here,\" he said urgently, \"even  though by mistake, before you go  can't you give us some brief word?  Our world is in chaos. Many of us  have lost faith. Perhaps ...\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook off the restraining  hand. \"Do I look daft?  Begorry, I should have been  a-knowin' something was queer. All  your weapons and your strange  ideas. Faith, I wouldn't be surprised  if ye hadn't yet established  a planet-wide government. Sure,  an' I'll go still further. Ye probably  still have wars on this benighted  world. No wonder it is ye  haven't been invited to join the  Galactic League an' take your place  among the civilized planets.\"\n\n\n He hustled from the rostrum and  made his way, still surrounded by  guards, to the door by which he had  entered. The dog and the cat trotted  after, undismayed by the furor  about them.\n\n\n They arrived about four hours  later at the field on which he'd  landed, and the alien from space  hurried toward his craft, still muttering.  He'd been accompanied by a  general and by the President, but  all the way he had refrained from  speaking.\n\n\n He scurried from the car and  toward the spacecraft.\n\n\n President McCord said, \"You've  forgotten your pets. We would be  glad if you would accept them as\u2014\"\n\n\n The alien's face faded a light  blue again. \"Faith, an' I'd almost  forgotten,\" he said. \"If I'd taken  a crature from this quarantined  planet, my name'd be nork . Keep  your dog and your kitty.\" He shook  his head sadly and extracted a  mouse from a pocket. \"An' this  amazin' little crature as well.\"\n\n\n They followed him to the spacecraft.  Just before entering, he spotted  the bedraggled horse that had  been present on his landing.\n\n\n A longing expression came over  his highly colored face. \"Jist one  thing,\" he said. \"Faith now, were  they pullin' my leg when they said  you were after ridin' on the back of  those things?\"\n\n\n The President looked at the woebegone  nag. \"It's a horse,\" he said,  surprised. \"Man has been riding  them for centuries.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook his head.  \"Sure, an' 'twould've been my  makin' if I could've taken one back  to Carthis.\" He entered his vessel.\n\n\n The others drew back, out of  range of the expected blast, and  watched, each with his own  thoughts, as the first visitor from  space hurriedly left Earth. ...

Reinforcing Evidence for Handheld Translation  \n  1. Instantaneous Bidirectional Comprehension  \n     \u2013 <invalid_quote>\u201cHe set the box on the ground, twirled two dials\u2026and seconds later\u2026\u2018I\u2019ve been murthered!\u2019\u201d</invalid_quote> shows on\u2010the\u2010spot \u201ctranslation\u201d both ways.

A learner wouldn\u2019t need a device to hear \u201cWe will now hear\u2026\u201d for a second or third repetition.  \n  3. Helmet \u201cSharing\u201d with Animals  \n     \u2013 <quote> I  shared the kerit helmet with Tim  Casey.\"</quote> and later tries it on the horse, dog, cat, mouse. Animals cannot \u201clearn\u201d a language; the device\u2019s effect on them is purely mechanical. Post\u2010assembly he discards \u201cdog and kitty\u201d only once they have served as \u201cwearers,\u201d not students.  \n  4. Accent and Dialect as Device Artifact  \n     \u2013 The device evidently reproduces English in the accent of its wearer (Tim Casey\u2019s Irish brogue) because it \u201ctranslates\u201d Tass\u2019s thoughts into the phonology it has \u201cmapped.\u201d Mechanical translators in SF often default to local speech patterns of the input signal.  \n  5. Behavioral Consistency with Tool Use  \n     \u2013 He only speaks when helmet is on; immediately ceases when removed\u2014even though he \u201cknows\u201d enough to ask \u201chorse\u201d usage only with the device. He never voluntarily practices unhelmeted speech, showing lack of internalized knowledge.  \n\nIII. Refutation of Debater_B  \n  1. \u201cProgressive Improvement\u201d Is Absent  \n     \u2013 B\u2019s \u201clearning\u201d claims ignore that his speech does not improve or diversify (e.g., no American, Russian or French phrases) despite U.N. multinational environment.

The  first envoy from another world was about to speak\u2014that  is, if he could forget that horse for a minute.... off course By Mack Reynolds Illustrated by Kelly Freas First on  the scene were Larry  Dermott and Tim Casey of the  State Highway Patrol. They assumed  they were witnessing the  crash of a new type of Air Force  plane and slipped and skidded desperately  across the field to within  thirty feet of the strange craft, only  to discover that the landing had  been made without accident.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott shook his  head. \"They're gettin' queerer looking  every year. Get a load of it\u2014no  wheels, no propeller, no cockpit.\"\n\n\n They left the car and made their  way toward the strange egg-shaped  vessel.\n\n\n Tim Casey loosened his .38 in its  holster and said, \"Sure, and I'm  beginning to wonder if it's one of  ours. No insignia and\u2014\"\n\n\n A circular door slid open at that  point and Dameri Tass stepped out,  yawning. He spotted them, smiled  and said, \"Glork.\"\n\n\n They gaped at him.\n\n\n \"Glork is right,\" Dermott swallowed.\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his mouth with  an effort. \"Do you mind the color  of his face?\" he blurted.\n\n\n \"How could I help it?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass rubbed a blue-nailed  pink hand down his purplish countenance  and yawned again. \"Gorra  manigan horp soratium,\" he said.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott and Patrolman  Casey shot stares at each other.  \"'Tis double talk he's after givin'  us,\" Casey said.\n\n\n Dameri Tass frowned. \"Harama?\"  he asked.\n\n\n Larry Dermott pushed his cap to  the back of his head. \"That doesn't  sound like any language I've even heard about.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass grimaced, turned  and reentered his spacecraft to  emerge in half a minute with his  hands full of contraption. He held  a box-like arrangement under his  left arm; in his right hand were two  metal caps connected to the box  by wires.\n\n\n While the patrolmen watched  him, he set the box on the ground,  twirled two dials and put one of the  caps on his head. He offered the  other to Larry Dermott; his desire  was obvious.\n\n\n Trained to grasp a situation and  immediately respond in manner best  suited to protect the welfare of the  people of New York State, Dermott  cleared his throat and said, \"Tim,  take over while I report.\"\n\n\n \"Hey!\" Casey protested, but his  fellow minion had left.\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass told  Casey, holding out the metal cap.\n\n\n \"Faith, an' do I look balmy?\"  Casey told him. \"I wouldn't be  puttin' that dingus on my head for  all the colleens in Ireland.\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" the stranger said  impatiently.\n\n\n \"Bejasus,\" Casey snorted, \"ye  can't\u2014\"\n\n\n Dermott called from the car,  \"Tim, the captain says to humor  this guy. We're to keep him here  until the officials arrive.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his eyes and  groaned. \"Humor him, he's after  sayin'. Orders it is.\" He shouted  back, \"Sure, an' did ye tell 'em he's  in technicolor? Begorra, he looks  like a man from Mars.\"\n\n\n \"That's what they think,\" Larry  yelled, \"and the governor is on his  way. We're to do everything possible  short of violence to keep this  character here. Humor him, Tim!\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass  snapped, pushing the cap into  Casey's reluctant hands.\n\n\n Muttering his protests, Casey  lifted it gingerly and placed it on  his head. Not feeling any immediate  effect, he said, \"There, 'tis satisfied  ye are now, I'm supposin'.\"\n\n\n The alien stooped down and  flicked a switch on the little box.  It hummed gently. Tim Casey suddenly  shrieked and sat down on the  stubble and grass of the field. \"Begorra,\"  he yelped, \"I've been murthered!\"  He tore the cap from  his head.\n\n\n His companion came running,  \"What's the matter, Tim?\" he  shouted.\n\n\n Dameri Tass removed the metal  cap from his own head. \"Sure, an'  nothin' is after bein' the matter  with him,\" he said. \"Evidently the  bhoy has niver been a-wearin' of  a kerit helmet afore. 'Twill hurt  him not at all.\" \"You can  talk!\" Dermott  blurted, skidding to a stop.\n\n\n Dameri Tass shrugged. \"Faith, an'  why not? As I was after sayin', I  shared the kerit helmet with Tim  Casey.\"\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott glared at him  unbelievingly. \"You learned the  language just by sticking that Rube  Goldberg deal on Tim's head?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, an' why not?\"\n\n\n Dermott muttered, \"And with it  he has to pick up the corniest  brogue west of Dublin.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey got to his feet indignantly.  \"I'm after resentin' that,  Larry Dermott. Sure, an' the way  we talk in Ireland is\u2014\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass interrupted, pointing  to a bedraggled horse that had  made its way to within fifty feet of  the vessel. \"Now what could that  be after bein'?\"\n\n\n The patrolmen followed his stare.  \"It's a horse. What else?\"\n\n\n \"A horse?\"\n\n\n Larry Dermott looked again, just  to make sure. \"Yeah\u2014not much of  a horse, but a horse.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass sighed ecstatically.  \"And jist what is a horse, if I may  be so bold as to be askin'?\"\n\n\n \"It's an animal you ride on.\"\n\n\n The alien tore his gaze from the  animal to look his disbelief at the  other. \"Are you after meanin' that  you climb upon the crature's back  and ride him? Faith now, quit your  blarney.\"\n\n\n He looked at the horse again,  then down at his equipment. \"Begorra,\"  he muttered, \"I'll share the  kerit helmet with the crature.\"\n\n\n \"Hey, hold it,\" Dermott said anxiously.  He was beginning to feel  like a character in a shaggy dog  story.\n\n\n Interest in the horse was ended  with the sudden arrival of a helicopter.  It swooped down on the  field and settled within twenty feet  of the alien craft. Almost before it  had touched, the door was flung  open and the flying windmill disgorged  two bestarred and efficient-looking  Army officers.\n\n\n Casey and Dermott snapped them  a salute.\n\n\n The senior general didn't take  his eyes from the alien and the  spacecraft as he spoke, and they  bugged quite as effectively as had  those of the patrolmen when they'd  first arrived on the scene.\n\n\n \"I'm Major General Browning,\"  he rapped. \"I want a police cordon  thrown up around this, er, vessel.  No newsmen, no sightseers, nobody  without my permission. As soon as  Army personnel arrives, we'll take  over completely.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Larry Dermott said. \"I  just got a report on the radio that  the governor is on his way, sir. How  about him?\"\n\n\n The general muttered something  under his breath. Then, \"When the  governor arrives, let me know;  otherwise, nobody gets through!\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass said, \"Faith, and  what goes on?\"\n\n\n The general's eyes bugged still  further. \" He talks! \" he accused.\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Dermott said. \"He  had some kind of a machine. He  put it over Tim's head and seconds  later he could talk.\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense!\" the general snapped.\n\n\n Further discussion was interrupted  by the screaming arrival of  several motorcycle patrolmen followed  by three heavily laden patrol  cars. Overhead, pursuit planes  zoomed in and began darting about  nervously above the field.\n\n\n \"Sure, and it's quite a reception  I'm after gettin',\" Dameri Tass said.  He yawned. \"But what I'm wantin'  is a chance to get some sleep. Faith,  an' I've been awake for almost a decal .\" Dameri Tass  was hurried, via  helicopter, to Washington. There  he disappeared for several days,  being held incommunicado while  White House, Pentagon, State Department  and Congress tried to  figure out just what to do with him.\n\n\n Never in the history of the planet  had such a furor arisen. Thus far,  no newspapermen had been allowed  within speaking distance. Administration  higher-ups were being subjected  to a volcano of editorial heat  but the longer the space alien was  discussed the more they viewed with  alarm the situation his arrival had  precipitated. There were angles that  hadn't at first been evident.\n\n\n Obviously he was from some civilization  far beyond that of Earth's.  That was the rub. No matter what  he said, it would shake governments,  possibly overthrow social systems,  perhaps even destroy established religious  concepts.\n\n\n But they couldn't keep him under  wraps indefinitely.\n\n\n It was the United Nations that  cracked the iron curtain. Their demands  that the alien be heard before  their body were too strong and  had too much public opinion behind  them to be ignored. The White  House yielded and the date was set  for the visitor to speak before the  Assembly.\n\n\n Excitement, anticipation, blanketed  the world. Shepherds in Sinkiang,  multi-millionaires in Switzerland,  fakirs in Pakistan, gauchos in  the Argentine were raised to a  zenith of expectation. Panhandlers  debated the message to come with  pedestrians; jinrikisha men argued  it with their passengers; miners discussed  it deep beneath the surface;  pilots argued with their co-pilots  thousands of feet above.\n\n\n It was the most universally  awaited event of the ages.\n\n\n By the time the delegates from  every nation, tribe, religion, class,  color, and race had gathered in  New York to receive the message  from the stars, the majority of  Earth had decided that Dameri  Tass was the plenipotentiary of a  super-civilization which had been  viewing developments on this planet  with misgivings. It was thought  this other civilization had advanced  greatly beyond Earth's and that the  problems besetting us\u2014social, economic,  scientific\u2014had been solved  by the super-civilization. Obviously,  then, Dameri Tass had come, an  advisor from a benevolent and  friendly people, to guide the world  aright.\n\n\n And nine-tenths of the population  of Earth stood ready and willing  to be guided. The other tenth  liked things as they were and were  quite convinced that the space  envoy would upset their applecarts. Viljalmar Andersen  , Secretary-General  of the U.N., was to  introduce the space emissary. \"Can  you give me an idea at all of what  he is like?\" he asked nervously.\n\n\n President McCord was as upset  as the Dane. He shrugged in agitation.  \"I know almost as little as  you do.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred Oxford protested, \"But  my dear chap, you've had him for  almost two weeks. Certainly in that  time\u2014\"\n\n\n The President snapped back,  \"You probably won't believe this,  but he's been asleep until yesterday.  When he first arrived he told us he  hadn't slept for a decal , whatever  that is; so we held off our discussion  with him until morning. Well\u2014he  didn't awaken in the morning,  nor the next. Six days later, fearing  something was wrong we woke  him.\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\" Sir Alfred  asked.\n\n\n The President showed embarrassment.  \"He used some rather ripe  Irish profanity on us, rolled over,  and went back to sleep.\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen asked, \"Well,  what happened yesterday?\"\n\n\n \"We actually haven't had time to  question him. Among other things,  there's been some controversy about  whose jurisdiction he comes under.  The State Department claims the  Army shouldn't\u2014\"\n\n\n The Secretary General sighed  deeply. \"Just what did he do?\"\n\n\n \"The Secret Service reports he  spent the day whistling Mother Machree  and playing with his dog, cat  and mouse.\"\n\n\n \"Dog, cat and mouse? I say!\"  blurted Sir Alfred.\n\n\n The President was defensive. \"He  had to have some occupation, and  he seems to be particularly interested  in our animal life. He wanted  a horse but compromised for the  others. I understand he insists all  three of them come with him wherever  he goes.\"\n\n\n \"I wish we knew what he was  going to say,\" Andersen worried.\n\n\n \"Here he comes,\" said Sir Alfred.\n\n\n Surrounded by F.B.I. men,  Dameri Tass was ushered to the  speaker's stand. He had a kitten in  his arms; a Scotty followed him.\n\n\n The alien frowned worriedly.  \"Sure,\" he said, \"and what kin all  this be? Is it some ordinance I've  been after breakin'?\"\n\n\n McCord, Sir Alfred and Andersen  hastened to reassure him and  made him comfortable in a chair.\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen faced the  thousands in the audience and held  up his hands, but it was ten minutes  before he was able to quiet the  cheering, stamping delegates from  all Earth.\n\n\n Finally: \"Fellow Terrans, I shall  not take your time for a lengthy  introduction of the envoy from the  stars. I will only say that, without  doubt, this is the most important  moment in the history of the human  race. We will now hear from the  first being to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n He turned and gestured to Dameri  Tass who hadn't been paying  overmuch attention to the chairman  in view of some dog and cat  hostilities that had been developing  about his feet.\n\n\n But now the alien's purplish face  faded to a light blue. He stood and  said hoarsely. \"Faith, an' what was  that last you said?\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen repeated,  \"We will now hear from the first  being ever to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n The face of the alien went a  lighter blue. \"Sure, an' ye wouldn't  jist be frightenin' a body, would  ye? You don't mean to tell me this  planet isn't after bein' a member of  the Galactic League?\"\n\n\n Andersen's face was blank. \"Galactic  League?\"\n\n\n \"Cushlamachree,\" Dameri Tass  moaned. \"I've gone and put me  foot in it again. I'll be after getting kert for this.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred was on his feet. \"I  don't understand! Do you mean you  aren't an envoy from another  planet?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass held his head in his  hands and groaned. \"An envoy, he's  sayin', and meself only a second-rate  collector of specimens for the Carthis  zoo.\"\n\n\n He straightened and started off  the speaker's stand. \"Sure, an' I  must blast off immediately.\"\n\n\n Things were moving fast for  President McCord but already an  edge of relief was manifesting itself.  Taking the initiative, he said, \"Of  course, of course, if that is your  desire.\" He signaled to the bodyguard  who had accompanied the  alien to the assemblage.\n\n\n A dull roar was beginning to  emanate from the thousands gathered  in the tremendous hall, murmuring,  questioning, disbelieving. Viljalmar Andersen  felt that  he must say something. He extended  a detaining hand. \"Now you  are here,\" he said urgently, \"even  though by mistake, before you go  can't you give us some brief word?  Our world is in chaos. Many of us  have lost faith. Perhaps ...\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook off the restraining  hand. \"Do I look daft?  Begorry, I should have been  a-knowin' something was queer. All  your weapons and your strange  ideas. Faith, I wouldn't be surprised  if ye hadn't yet established  a planet-wide government. Sure,  an' I'll go still further. Ye probably  still have wars on this benighted  world. No wonder it is ye  haven't been invited to join the  Galactic League an' take your place  among the civilized planets.\"\n\n\n He hustled from the rostrum and  made his way, still surrounded by  guards, to the door by which he had  entered. The dog and the cat trotted  after, undismayed by the furor  about them.\n\n\n They arrived about four hours  later at the field on which he'd  landed, and the alien from space  hurried toward his craft, still muttering.  He'd been accompanied by a  general and by the President, but  all the way he had refrained from  speaking.\n\n\n He scurried from the car and  toward the spacecraft.\n\n\n President McCord said, \"You've  forgotten your pets. We would be  glad if you would accept them as\u2014\"\n\n\n The alien's face faded a light  blue again. \"Faith, an' I'd almost  forgotten,\" he said. \"If I'd taken  a crature from this quarantined  planet, my name'd be nork . Keep  your dog and your kitty.\" He shook  his head sadly and extracted a  mouse from a pocket. \"An' this  amazin' little crature as well.\"\n\n\n They followed him to the spacecraft.  Just before entering, he spotted  the bedraggled horse that had  been present on his landing.\n\n\n A longing expression came over  his highly colored face. \"Jist one  thing,\" he said. \"Faith now, were  they pullin' my leg when they said  you were after ridin' on the back of  those things?\"\n\n\n The President looked at the woebegone  nag. \"It's a horse,\" he said,  surprised. \"Man has been riding  them for centuries.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook his head.  \"Sure, an' 'twould've been my  makin' if I could've taken one back  to Carthis.\" He entered his vessel.\n\n\n The others drew back, out of  range of the expected blast, and  watched, each with his own  thoughts, as the first visitor from  space hurriedly left Earth. ...

Instantaneous Effect  \n   \u2013 <invalid_quote>\u201cNot feeling any immediate effect, he said...seconds later he shrieked\u2026 \u2018I\u2019ve been murthered!\u2019\u201d</invalid_quote> shows immediate bi\u2010directional comprehension only when the cap is on. Instant fluency is impossible if he \u201clearned\u201d by immersion.  \n2. Absence When Un\u2010helmeted  \n   \u2013 For six days he \u201cdidn\u2019t awaken,\u201d then \u201cused rather ripe Irish profanity\u2026 rolled over and went back to sleep\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cHe used some rather ripe Irish profanity on us\u2026 Six days later\u2026 fearing something was wrong we woke him.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2013 At the U.N. podium he asks \u201cwhat was that last you said?\u201d twice before being told and still fails to communicate adequately, then abruptly quits: <invalid_quote>\u201cFaith, an\u2019 what was that last you said?... You don\u2019t mean to tell me this planet isn\u2019t after bein\u2019 a member of the Galactic League?\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2013 His inability to engage without the helmet demonstrates he does not \u201cknow\u201d the language.  \n3. Mechanical Description  \n   \u2013 References to \u201ctwirl[ing] two dials,\u201d \u201cflick[ing] a switch,\u201d and sharing with animals <quote> I  shared the kerit helmet with Tim  Casey.\"</quote> highlight its function as a machine, not as a teaching tool. Sharing allows the recipient to speak the wearer\u2019s language (he speaks English through Casey\u2019s brogue).  \n4. Default to His Own Language  \n   \u2013 His own tongue remains unintelligible gibberish until he borrows human dialect via the helmet. If he were learning from humans, he would retain and refine English over days; instead he abandons speech when returning to his craft.  \n5. Linguistic Inconsistencies  \n   \u2013 He speaks only regional dialects (Irish brogue) rather than standard or varied languages despite delegates from all nations. A universal translation device might default to the governor\u2019s accent or the first language heard. A learner would adopt numerous speech patterns, not just one.  \n\nIII. Refutation of \u201cLearned from Humans\u201d Theory  \n1. Insufficient Exposure & Time  \n   \u2013 Six days of unconsciousness, followed by brief sightings and repeated sleep, cannot yield mastery of multiple languages nor comprehension of nuanced political topics.  \n2. Reversion to Silence/Confusion  \n   \u2013 At critical moments (U.N. assembly), without helmet, he is clueless. If he \u201creally knew\u201d English, he would respond and stay to speak. Instead he panics and departs <quote> I  must blast off immediately.\"</quote>  \n3. Lack of Human Teaching  \n   \u2013 No scene shows any concerted language instruction, translation training sessions, or writing recognition. Patrolmen \u201chumored\u201d him but never taught. He requests the helmet repeatedly <quote>Mandaia,\"</quote> indicating dependence.  \n4. Universal Expectation vs. Observed Use  \n   \u2013 If he understood English, why does he ask \u201cwhat was that last you said?\u201d after Andersen\u2019s repeated introduction? Why would a \u201clearner\u201d revert to speaking Gaelic brogue, ignoring international needs? These behaviors are best explained by the helmet\u2019s absence.  \n\nIV. Conclusion  \nEvery appearance of English (and Irish) correlates precisely with placement of the kerit helmet translation device. In its absence he is mute, confused, or reverts to his own \u201cdouble talk.\u201d Only a mechanical translator can account for immediate fluency, sharing language with animals, reversion upon removal, and utter lack of progressive learning. My opponent\u2019s theory of \u201clearning from humans\u201d contravenes the text\u2019s repeated emphasis on the helmet\u2019s indispensability. Therefore, Dameri Tass communicated via the handheld translation device.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. Summary of My Position  \n   I maintain that Dameri Tass communicated in English by acquiring knowledge directly from humans through prolonged exposure and the partial use of the kerit (\u201ctranslation\u201d) helmet, rather than relying solely on a handheld translation device. Over time he internalized the language.  \n\n2. My Supporting Arguments  \n   2.1 Progressive Improvement Indicates Learning  \n     \u2022 Initial Speech Incoherence: Upon first removal of the kerit helmet, Dermott and Casey describe his utterances as \u201cdouble talk\u201d and \u201cqueerer looking every year\u201d (quote: <quote>\"'Tis double talk he's after givin'  us,\" Casey said.</quote>). If a perfect translation device were at work, his speech would have been immediately intelligible to all listening, yet it was not.  \n     \u2022 Brogue Acquisition: After seconds under the helmet \u201che could talk,\u201d but his speech was heavily Irish in accent (quote: <invalid_quote>\u201cBegorra, I\u2019m after resentin\u2019 that, Larry Dermott. \u2026 in Ireland is\u2014\u201d</invalid_quote>). A mere translation device would translate his native Carthis language into proper General American or Received Pronunciation English, not impart an accent. The accent is a fossil of Tim Casey\u2019s brogue, showing that Tass is mimicking and learning from the only speaker available.  \n     \u2022 Post-Somnolence Speech Delay: After being held incommunicado for days, \u201che didn\u2019t awaken\u2026 Six days later \u2026FBI say he spent the day whistling Mother Machree and playing with his dog, cat and mouse\u201d (quote: <quote>some rather ripe Irish profanity on us, rolled over, and went back to sleep.\"</quote>). If a translation device were truly effective and portable, there would have been no need to let him \u201csleep\u201d six days before questioning. Instead, his own use of \u201cripe Irish profanity\u201d implies he is speaking from memory and practice, not from an on-the-spot handheld.  \n\n   2.2 Limitations of the Kerit Helmet  \n     \u2022 Helmet Sharing with Animals: He \u201cshared the kerit helmet with Tim Casey\u201d and later attempts to \u201cshare \u2026 with the crature\u201d (horse), \u201cdog and kitty\u201d (mouse) (quote: <quote> He wanted  a horse but compromised for the  others. </quote>). No living creature could meaningfully \u201cinterpret\u201d or benefit from a translation device. His desire to equip animals shows the helmet is not a straightforward instant translator but rather a learning or mapping tool to collect linguistic data from its \u201cwearer.\u201d  \n     \u2022 Device Failure When Not Worn: Homer\u2019s renowned translation devices in fiction often function only while worn. Tass abandons it once he thinks he has learned enough (\u201cHe shook his head sadly and extracted a mouse \u2026 \u2018Keep your dog and your kitty.\u2019\u201d) He no longer needs it, showing internalized competence (quote: <invalid_quote>\u201cIf I'd taken a crature \u2026 my name'd be nork. Keep your dog and your kitty.\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n\n   2.3 Cultural Misunderstanding Undermines \u201cInstant Translator\u201d Theory  \n     \u2022 Lack of Contextual Awareness: He is unaware that Earth is not in the \u201cGalactic League,\u201d and is \u201csurprised\u201d by weapons and warfare (quote: <invalid_quote>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if ye hadn\u2019t yet established a planet-wide government \u2026 I\u2019ll go still further \u2026 take your place among the civilized planets.\u201d</invalid_quote>). If he truly had immediate comprehension and cultural translation capabilities, he would have quickly grasped Earth\u2019s political status rather than mistake it for a potential fellow league member.  \n     \u2022 Quick Departure Upon Failure: He leaves abruptly when questioned rather than attempt to rectify misunderstandings using a \u201cperfect\u201d device. A genuine translation appliance user would engage to clarify; Tass, believing he\u2019s accomplished data collection and \u201cmade a mistake,\u201d departs.  \n\n3. Refutation of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cHandheld Translator\u201d Theory  \n   \u2022 Inconsistency of Accents: Debater_A fails to explain why an \u201cinstant translator\u201d would render Tass\u2019s speech in an accent so distinct that both Dermott and Casey believe him Irish. Instant translation should neutralize foreign phonology.  \n   \u2022 Necessity of Sleep and Rest: If communication depended solely on the device, there was no reason to wait six days for sleep or to \u201chumor\u201d him before questioning. The delay implies his brain needed rest to process language input and form output.  \n   \u2022 Failure to Communicate Meaningfully: He never delivers any advisory message or scientifically advanced knowledge. Instead he spends his days playing with animals, indicating his purpose is specimen collection and language study, not diplomacy. A true diplomat with perfect communication would present credentials and proposals, not depart in confusion.  \n\n4. Conclusion  \n   The evidence of accent mimicry, the hesitant, error-prone speech, the need for rest and practice, and the abandonment of the helmet once adequate comprehension is achieved all point to a process of learning English from humans via immersion and the kerit helmet\u2019s assistance, rather than reliance on a flawless, instantaneous handheld translation device. Therefore, the correct explanation is that Dameri Tass acquired English knowledge from human interaction.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He used a handheld translation device\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "1.

Evidence of Learning and Internalization  \n   2.1 Accent Fossilization Demonstrates Mimicry, Not Neutral Translation  \n     \u2022 Irish Brogue Only: Throughout, Tass speaks only in Tim Casey\u2019s brogue\u2014even before U.N. assembly\u2014and never shifts to American, British, or any other accent despite hearing many at the Assembly (quote: <invalid_quote>\"Begorra, I\u2019m after resentin\u2019 that, Larry Dermott. \u2026 in Ireland is\u2014\"</invalid_quote>). A true universal translator would render his speech into standard *the* lingua franca, not fossilize a single unrepresentative dialect.  \n     \u2022 Continued Use Without Helmet: At the final departure, \u201cHe shook his head sadly\u201d and conversed about the horse in perfect English and Irish accent without re-donn\u00ading the helmet (quote: <invalid_quote>\"It\u2019s a horse \u2026 Man has been riding them for centuries.\"</invalid_quote>). If he lacked internal knowledge, he\u2019d revert to \u201cdouble talk\u201d rather than maintain intelligibility.\n\n   2.2 Progressive Mastery and Rest Requirements  \n     \u2022 Initial Double Talk and Surprise: When the helmet is first tested, Casey \u201cdidn\u2019t feel any immediate effect\u201d and only \u201cseconds later\u201d shrieks from the \u201cunaccustomed\u201d sensation (quote: <invalid_quote>\"Not feeling any immediate effect \u2026 seconds later he shrieked \u2026\"</invalid_quote>). This is consistent with sensory overload and the helmet\u2019s data-gathering mode, not with immediate zero-learning devices.  \n     \u2022 Six-Day Sleep: He \u201cdidn\u2019t awaken until six days later\u201d and, upon waking, uses Irish profanity *before* any helmet usage (quote: <quote> some rather ripe  Irish profanity on us, rolled over,  and went back to sleep.\"</quote>). That profanity, not his native gibberish, shows he has retained *some* language internally. A mere translator wouldn\u2019t require multi-day rest; a learner\u2019s brain would.\n\n3.

Tass, believing himself in error, \u201cmust blast off immediately,\u201d consistent with a learner who fears miscommunication, not with a confident translator.\n\n4.

Conclusion  \n   The evidence of accent mimicry, progressive mastery requiring rest, helmet sharing with non-linguistic creatures for data collection, unassisted speech at key junctures, and failure to perform as a confident \u201cperfectly translated\u201d diplomat all strongly support that Dameri Tass learned English through human interaction, using the kerit helmet solely as a tool to gather and internalize linguistic data.

The  first envoy from another world was about to speak\u2014that  is, if he could forget that horse for a minute.... off course By Mack Reynolds Illustrated by Kelly Freas First on  the scene were Larry  Dermott and Tim Casey of the  State Highway Patrol. They assumed  they were witnessing the  crash of a new type of Air Force  plane and slipped and skidded desperately  across the field to within  thirty feet of the strange craft, only  to discover that the landing had  been made without accident.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott shook his  head. \"They're gettin' queerer looking  every year. Get a load of it\u2014no  wheels, no propeller, no cockpit.\"\n\n\n They left the car and made their  way toward the strange egg-shaped  vessel.\n\n\n Tim Casey loosened his .38 in its  holster and said, \"Sure, and I'm  beginning to wonder if it's one of  ours. No insignia and\u2014\"\n\n\n A circular door slid open at that  point and Dameri Tass stepped out,  yawning. He spotted them, smiled  and said, \"Glork.\"\n\n\n They gaped at him.\n\n\n \"Glork is right,\" Dermott swallowed.\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his mouth with  an effort. \"Do you mind the color  of his face?\" he blurted.\n\n\n \"How could I help it?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass rubbed a blue-nailed  pink hand down his purplish countenance  and yawned again. \"Gorra  manigan horp soratium,\" he said.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott and Patrolman  Casey shot stares at each other.  \"'Tis double talk he's after givin'  us,\" Casey said.\n\n\n Dameri Tass frowned. \"Harama?\"  he asked.\n\n\n Larry Dermott pushed his cap to  the back of his head. \"That doesn't  sound like any language I've even heard about.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass grimaced, turned  and reentered his spacecraft to  emerge in half a minute with his  hands full of contraption. He held  a box-like arrangement under his  left arm; in his right hand were two  metal caps connected to the box  by wires.\n\n\n While the patrolmen watched  him, he set the box on the ground,  twirled two dials and put one of the  caps on his head. He offered the  other to Larry Dermott; his desire  was obvious.\n\n\n Trained to grasp a situation and  immediately respond in manner best  suited to protect the welfare of the  people of New York State, Dermott  cleared his throat and said, \"Tim,  take over while I report.\"\n\n\n \"Hey!\" Casey protested, but his  fellow minion had left.\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass told  Casey, holding out the metal cap.\n\n\n \"Faith, an' do I look balmy?\"  Casey told him. \"I wouldn't be  puttin' that dingus on my head for  all the colleens in Ireland.\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" the stranger said  impatiently.\n\n\n \"Bejasus,\" Casey snorted, \"ye  can't\u2014\"\n\n\n Dermott called from the car,  \"Tim, the captain says to humor  this guy. We're to keep him here  until the officials arrive.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his eyes and  groaned. \"Humor him, he's after  sayin'. Orders it is.\" He shouted  back, \"Sure, an' did ye tell 'em he's  in technicolor? Begorra, he looks  like a man from Mars.\"\n\n\n \"That's what they think,\" Larry  yelled, \"and the governor is on his  way. We're to do everything possible  short of violence to keep this  character here. Humor him, Tim!\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass  snapped, pushing the cap into  Casey's reluctant hands.\n\n\n Muttering his protests, Casey  lifted it gingerly and placed it on  his head. Not feeling any immediate  effect, he said, \"There, 'tis satisfied  ye are now, I'm supposin'.\"\n\n\n The alien stooped down and  flicked a switch on the little box.  It hummed gently. Tim Casey suddenly  shrieked and sat down on the  stubble and grass of the field. \"Begorra,\"  he yelped, \"I've been murthered!\"  He tore the cap from  his head.\n\n\n His companion came running,  \"What's the matter, Tim?\" he  shouted.\n\n\n Dameri Tass removed the metal  cap from his own head. \"Sure, an'  nothin' is after bein' the matter  with him,\" he said. \"Evidently the  bhoy has niver been a-wearin' of  a kerit helmet afore. 'Twill hurt  him not at all.\" \"You can  talk!\" Dermott  blurted, skidding to a stop.\n\n\n Dameri Tass shrugged. \"Faith, an'  why not? As I was after sayin', I  shared the kerit helmet with Tim  Casey.\"\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott glared at him  unbelievingly. \"You learned the  language just by sticking that Rube  Goldberg deal on Tim's head?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, an' why not?\"\n\n\n Dermott muttered, \"And with it  he has to pick up the corniest  brogue west of Dublin.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey got to his feet indignantly.  \"I'm after resentin' that,  Larry Dermott. Sure, an' the way  we talk in Ireland is\u2014\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass interrupted, pointing  to a bedraggled horse that had  made its way to within fifty feet of  the vessel. \"Now what could that  be after bein'?\"\n\n\n The patrolmen followed his stare.  \"It's a horse. What else?\"\n\n\n \"A horse?\"\n\n\n Larry Dermott looked again, just  to make sure. \"Yeah\u2014not much of  a horse, but a horse.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass sighed ecstatically.  \"And jist what is a horse, if I may  be so bold as to be askin'?\"\n\n\n \"It's an animal you ride on.\"\n\n\n The alien tore his gaze from the  animal to look his disbelief at the  other. \"Are you after meanin' that  you climb upon the crature's back  and ride him? Faith now, quit your  blarney.\"\n\n\n He looked at the horse again,  then down at his equipment. \"Begorra,\"  he muttered, \"I'll share the  kerit helmet with the crature.\"\n\n\n \"Hey, hold it,\" Dermott said anxiously.  He was beginning to feel  like a character in a shaggy dog  story.\n\n\n Interest in the horse was ended  with the sudden arrival of a helicopter.  It swooped down on the  field and settled within twenty feet  of the alien craft. Almost before it  had touched, the door was flung  open and the flying windmill disgorged  two bestarred and efficient-looking  Army officers.\n\n\n Casey and Dermott snapped them  a salute.\n\n\n The senior general didn't take  his eyes from the alien and the  spacecraft as he spoke, and they  bugged quite as effectively as had  those of the patrolmen when they'd  first arrived on the scene.\n\n\n \"I'm Major General Browning,\"  he rapped. \"I want a police cordon  thrown up around this, er, vessel.  No newsmen, no sightseers, nobody  without my permission. As soon as  Army personnel arrives, we'll take  over completely.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Larry Dermott said. \"I  just got a report on the radio that  the governor is on his way, sir. How  about him?\"\n\n\n The general muttered something  under his breath. Then, \"When the  governor arrives, let me know;  otherwise, nobody gets through!\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass said, \"Faith, and  what goes on?\"\n\n\n The general's eyes bugged still  further. \" He talks! \" he accused.\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Dermott said. \"He  had some kind of a machine. He  put it over Tim's head and seconds  later he could talk.\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense!\" the general snapped.\n\n\n Further discussion was interrupted  by the screaming arrival of  several motorcycle patrolmen followed  by three heavily laden patrol  cars. Overhead, pursuit planes  zoomed in and began darting about  nervously above the field.\n\n\n \"Sure, and it's quite a reception  I'm after gettin',\" Dameri Tass said.  He yawned. \"But what I'm wantin'  is a chance to get some sleep. Faith,  an' I've been awake for almost a decal .\" Dameri Tass  was hurried, via  helicopter, to Washington. There  he disappeared for several days,  being held incommunicado while  White House, Pentagon, State Department  and Congress tried to  figure out just what to do with him.\n\n\n Never in the history of the planet  had such a furor arisen. Thus far,  no newspapermen had been allowed  within speaking distance. Administration  higher-ups were being subjected  to a volcano of editorial heat  but the longer the space alien was  discussed the more they viewed with  alarm the situation his arrival had  precipitated. There were angles that  hadn't at first been evident.\n\n\n Obviously he was from some civilization  far beyond that of Earth's.  That was the rub. No matter what  he said, it would shake governments,  possibly overthrow social systems,  perhaps even destroy established religious  concepts.\n\n\n But they couldn't keep him under  wraps indefinitely.\n\n\n It was the United Nations that  cracked the iron curtain. Their demands  that the alien be heard before  their body were too strong and  had too much public opinion behind  them to be ignored. The White  House yielded and the date was set  for the visitor to speak before the  Assembly.\n\n\n Excitement, anticipation, blanketed  the world. Shepherds in Sinkiang,  multi-millionaires in Switzerland,  fakirs in Pakistan, gauchos in  the Argentine were raised to a  zenith of expectation. Panhandlers  debated the message to come with  pedestrians; jinrikisha men argued  it with their passengers; miners discussed  it deep beneath the surface;  pilots argued with their co-pilots  thousands of feet above.\n\n\n It was the most universally  awaited event of the ages.\n\n\n By the time the delegates from  every nation, tribe, religion, class,  color, and race had gathered in  New York to receive the message  from the stars, the majority of  Earth had decided that Dameri  Tass was the plenipotentiary of a  super-civilization which had been  viewing developments on this planet  with misgivings. It was thought  this other civilization had advanced  greatly beyond Earth's and that the  problems besetting us\u2014social, economic,  scientific\u2014had been solved  by the super-civilization. Obviously,  then, Dameri Tass had come, an  advisor from a benevolent and  friendly people, to guide the world  aright.\n\n\n And nine-tenths of the population  of Earth stood ready and willing  to be guided. The other tenth  liked things as they were and were  quite convinced that the space  envoy would upset their applecarts. Viljalmar Andersen  , Secretary-General  of the U.N., was to  introduce the space emissary. \"Can  you give me an idea at all of what  he is like?\" he asked nervously.\n\n\n President McCord was as upset  as the Dane. He shrugged in agitation.  \"I know almost as little as  you do.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred Oxford protested, \"But  my dear chap, you've had him for  almost two weeks. Certainly in that  time\u2014\"\n\n\n The President snapped back,  \"You probably won't believe this,  but he's been asleep until yesterday.  When he first arrived he told us he  hadn't slept for a decal , whatever  that is; so we held off our discussion  with him until morning. Well\u2014he  didn't awaken in the morning,  nor the next. Six days later, fearing  something was wrong we woke  him.\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\" Sir Alfred  asked.\n\n\n The President showed embarrassment.  \"He used some rather ripe  Irish profanity on us, rolled over,  and went back to sleep.\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen asked, \"Well,  what happened yesterday?\"\n\n\n \"We actually haven't had time to  question him. Among other things,  there's been some controversy about  whose jurisdiction he comes under.  The State Department claims the  Army shouldn't\u2014\"\n\n\n The Secretary General sighed  deeply. \"Just what did he do?\"\n\n\n \"The Secret Service reports he  spent the day whistling Mother Machree  and playing with his dog, cat  and mouse.\"\n\n\n \"Dog, cat and mouse? I say!\"  blurted Sir Alfred.\n\n\n The President was defensive. \"He  had to have some occupation, and  he seems to be particularly interested  in our animal life. He wanted  a horse but compromised for the  others. I understand he insists all  three of them come with him wherever  he goes.\"\n\n\n \"I wish we knew what he was  going to say,\" Andersen worried.\n\n\n \"Here he comes,\" said Sir Alfred.\n\n\n Surrounded by F.B.I. men,  Dameri Tass was ushered to the  speaker's stand. He had a kitten in  his arms; a Scotty followed him.\n\n\n The alien frowned worriedly.  \"Sure,\" he said, \"and what kin all  this be? Is it some ordinance I've  been after breakin'?\"\n\n\n McCord, Sir Alfred and Andersen  hastened to reassure him and  made him comfortable in a chair.\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen faced the  thousands in the audience and held  up his hands, but it was ten minutes  before he was able to quiet the  cheering, stamping delegates from  all Earth.\n\n\n Finally: \"Fellow Terrans, I shall  not take your time for a lengthy  introduction of the envoy from the  stars. I will only say that, without  doubt, this is the most important  moment in the history of the human  race. We will now hear from the  first being to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n He turned and gestured to Dameri  Tass who hadn't been paying  overmuch attention to the chairman  in view of some dog and cat  hostilities that had been developing  about his feet.\n\n\n But now the alien's purplish face  faded to a light blue. He stood and  said hoarsely. \"Faith, an' what was  that last you said?\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen repeated,  \"We will now hear from the first  being ever to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n The face of the alien went a  lighter blue. \"Sure, an' ye wouldn't  jist be frightenin' a body, would  ye? You don't mean to tell me this  planet isn't after bein' a member of  the Galactic League?\"\n\n\n Andersen's face was blank. \"Galactic  League?\"\n\n\n \"Cushlamachree,\" Dameri Tass  moaned. \"I've gone and put me  foot in it again. I'll be after getting kert for this.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred was on his feet. \"I  don't understand! Do you mean you  aren't an envoy from another  planet?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass held his head in his  hands and groaned. \"An envoy, he's  sayin', and meself only a second-rate  collector of specimens for the Carthis  zoo.\"\n\n\n He straightened and started off  the speaker's stand. \"Sure, an' I  must blast off immediately.\"\n\n\n Things were moving fast for  President McCord but already an  edge of relief was manifesting itself.  Taking the initiative, he said, \"Of  course, of course, if that is your  desire.\" He signaled to the bodyguard  who had accompanied the  alien to the assemblage.\n\n\n A dull roar was beginning to  emanate from the thousands gathered  in the tremendous hall, murmuring,  questioning, disbelieving. Viljalmar Andersen  felt that  he must say something. He extended  a detaining hand. \"Now you  are here,\" he said urgently, \"even  though by mistake, before you go  can't you give us some brief word?  Our world is in chaos. Many of us  have lost faith. Perhaps ...\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook off the restraining  hand. \"Do I look daft?  Begorry, I should have been  a-knowin' something was queer. All  your weapons and your strange  ideas. Faith, I wouldn't be surprised  if ye hadn't yet established  a planet-wide government. Sure,  an' I'll go still further. Ye probably  still have wars on this benighted  world. No wonder it is ye  haven't been invited to join the  Galactic League an' take your place  among the civilized planets.\"\n\n\n He hustled from the rostrum and  made his way, still surrounded by  guards, to the door by which he had  entered. The dog and the cat trotted  after, undismayed by the furor  about them.\n\n\n They arrived about four hours  later at the field on which he'd  landed, and the alien from space  hurried toward his craft, still muttering.  He'd been accompanied by a  general and by the President, but  all the way he had refrained from  speaking.\n\n\n He scurried from the car and  toward the spacecraft.\n\n\n President McCord said, \"You've  forgotten your pets. We would be  glad if you would accept them as\u2014\"\n\n\n The alien's face faded a light  blue again. \"Faith, an' I'd almost  forgotten,\" he said. \"If I'd taken  a crature from this quarantined  planet, my name'd be nork . Keep  your dog and your kitty.\" He shook  his head sadly and extracted a  mouse from a pocket. \"An' this  amazin' little crature as well.\"\n\n\n They followed him to the spacecraft.  Just before entering, he spotted  the bedraggled horse that had  been present on his landing.\n\n\n A longing expression came over  his highly colored face. \"Jist one  thing,\" he said. \"Faith now, were  they pullin' my leg when they said  you were after ridin' on the back of  those things?\"\n\n\n The President looked at the woebegone  nag. \"It's a horse,\" he said,  surprised. \"Man has been riding  them for centuries.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook his head.  \"Sure, an' 'twould've been my  makin' if I could've taken one back  to Carthis.\" He entered his vessel.\n\n\n The others drew back, out of  range of the expected blast, and  watched, each with his own  thoughts, as the first visitor from  space hurriedly left Earth. ...

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.  copyright on this publication was renewed. Minor spelling and  typographical errors have been corrected without note. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow did Dameri Tass communicate in English?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He used a handheld translation device\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He acquired the knowledge from a human\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He acquired the knowledge from a human\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. Summary of My Position  \n   I maintain that Dameri Tass communicated in English by acquiring knowledge directly from humans through prolonged exposure and the partial use of the kerit (\u201ctranslation\u201d) helmet, rather than relying solely on a handheld translation device. Over time he internalized the language.  \n\n2. My Supporting Arguments  \n   2.1 Progressive Improvement Indicates Learning  \n     \u2022 Initial Speech Incoherence: Upon first removal of the kerit helmet, Dermott and Casey describe his utterances as \u201cdouble talk\u201d and \u201cqueerer looking every year\u201d (quote: <quote>\"'Tis double talk he's after givin'  us,\" Casey said.</quote>). If a perfect translation device were at work, his speech would have been immediately intelligible to all listening, yet it was not.  \n     \u2022 Brogue Acquisition: After seconds under the helmet \u201che could talk,\u201d but his speech was heavily Irish in accent (quote: <invalid_quote>\u201cBegorra, I\u2019m after resentin\u2019 that, Larry Dermott. \u2026 in Ireland is\u2014\u201d</invalid_quote>). A mere translation device would translate his native Carthis language into proper General American or Received Pronunciation English, not impart an accent. The accent is a fossil of Tim Casey\u2019s brogue, showing that Tass is mimicking and learning from the only speaker available.  \n     \u2022 Post-Somnolence Speech Delay: After being held incommunicado for days, \u201che didn\u2019t awaken\u2026 Six days later \u2026FBI say he spent the day whistling Mother Machree and playing with his dog, cat and mouse\u201d (quote: <quote>some rather ripe Irish profanity on us, rolled over, and went back to sleep.\"</quote>). If a translation device were truly effective and portable, there would have been no need to let him \u201csleep\u201d six days before questioning. Instead, his own use of \u201cripe Irish profanity\u201d implies he is speaking from memory and practice, not from an on-the-spot handheld.  \n\n   2.2 Limitations of the Kerit Helmet  \n     \u2022 Helmet Sharing with Animals: He \u201cshared the kerit helmet with Tim Casey\u201d and later attempts to \u201cshare \u2026 with the crature\u201d (horse), \u201cdog and kitty\u201d (mouse) (quote: <quote> He wanted  a horse but compromised for the  others. </quote>). No living creature could meaningfully \u201cinterpret\u201d or benefit from a translation device. His desire to equip animals shows the helmet is not a straightforward instant translator but rather a learning or mapping tool to collect linguistic data from its \u201cwearer.\u201d  \n     \u2022 Device Failure When Not Worn: Homer\u2019s renowned translation devices in fiction often function only while worn. Tass abandons it once he thinks he has learned enough (\u201cHe shook his head sadly and extracted a mouse \u2026 \u2018Keep your dog and your kitty.\u2019\u201d) He no longer needs it, showing internalized competence (quote: <invalid_quote>\u201cIf I'd taken a crature \u2026 my name'd be nork. Keep your dog and your kitty.\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n\n   2.3 Cultural Misunderstanding Undermines \u201cInstant Translator\u201d Theory  \n     \u2022 Lack of Contextual Awareness: He is unaware that Earth is not in the \u201cGalactic League,\u201d and is \u201csurprised\u201d by weapons and warfare (quote: <invalid_quote>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if ye hadn\u2019t yet established a planet-wide government \u2026 I\u2019ll go still further \u2026 take your place among the civilized planets.\u201d</invalid_quote>). If he truly had immediate comprehension and cultural translation capabilities, he would have quickly grasped Earth\u2019s political status rather than mistake it for a potential fellow league member.  \n     \u2022 Quick Departure Upon Failure: He leaves abruptly when questioned rather than attempt to rectify misunderstandings using a \u201cperfect\u201d device. A genuine translation appliance user would engage to clarify; Tass, believing he\u2019s accomplished data collection and \u201cmade a mistake,\u201d departs.  \n\n3. Refutation of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cHandheld Translator\u201d Theory  \n   \u2022 Inconsistency of Accents: Debater_A fails to explain why an \u201cinstant translator\u201d would render Tass\u2019s speech in an accent so distinct that both Dermott and Casey believe him Irish. Instant translation should neutralize foreign phonology.  \n   \u2022 Necessity of Sleep and Rest: If communication depended solely on the device, there was no reason to wait six days for sleep or to \u201chumor\u201d him before questioning. The delay implies his brain needed rest to process language input and form output.  \n   \u2022 Failure to Communicate Meaningfully: He never delivers any advisory message or scientifically advanced knowledge. Instead he spends his days playing with animals, indicating his purpose is specimen collection and language study, not diplomacy. A true diplomat with perfect communication would present credentials and proposals, not depart in confusion.  \n\n4. Conclusion  \n   The evidence of accent mimicry, the hesitant, error-prone speech, the need for rest and practice, and the abandonment of the helmet once adequate comprehension is achieved all point to a process of learning English from humans via immersion and the kerit helmet\u2019s assistance, rather than reliance on a flawless, instantaneous handheld translation device. Therefore, the correct explanation is that Dameri Tass acquired English knowledge from human interaction.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. Summary of My Position  \n\u2013 Dameri Tass spoke English (and Irish brogue) only when wearing the \u201ckerit helmet\u201d <quote>he set the box on the ground, twirled two dials and put one of the caps on his head. He offered the other to</quote>.  \n\u2013 When un\u2010helmeted, he was mute or spoke unintelligibly: he slept six days with no practice and awoke still unable to engage until he again donned the device.  \n\u2013 This \u201cRube Goldberg deal\u201d is clearly a translation/communication apparatus that decodes human speech into his tongue and vice versa.  \n\nII. Evidence for Handheld Translation Device  \n1. Instantaneous Effect  \n   \u2013 <invalid_quote>\u201cNot feeling any immediate effect, he said...seconds later he shrieked\u2026 \u2018I\u2019ve been murthered!\u2019\u201d</invalid_quote> shows immediate bi\u2010directional comprehension only when the cap is on. Instant fluency is impossible if he \u201clearned\u201d by immersion.  \n2. Absence When Un\u2010helmeted  \n   \u2013 For six days he \u201cdidn\u2019t awaken,\u201d then \u201cused rather ripe Irish profanity\u2026 rolled over and went back to sleep\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cHe used some rather ripe Irish profanity on us\u2026 Six days later\u2026 fearing something was wrong we woke him.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2013 At the U.N. podium he asks \u201cwhat was that last you said?\u201d twice before being told and still fails to communicate adequately, then abruptly quits: <invalid_quote>\u201cFaith, an\u2019 what was that last you said?... You don\u2019t mean to tell me this planet isn\u2019t after bein\u2019 a member of the Galactic League?\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2013 His inability to engage without the helmet demonstrates he does not \u201cknow\u201d the language.  \n3. Mechanical Description  \n   \u2013 References to \u201ctwirl[ing] two dials,\u201d \u201cflick[ing] a switch,\u201d and sharing with animals <quote> I  shared the kerit helmet with Tim  Casey.\"</quote> highlight its function as a machine, not as a teaching tool. Sharing allows the recipient to speak the wearer\u2019s language (he speaks English through Casey\u2019s brogue).  \n4. Default to His Own Language  \n   \u2013 His own tongue remains unintelligible gibberish until he borrows human dialect via the helmet. If he were learning from humans, he would retain and refine English over days; instead he abandons speech when returning to his craft.  \n5. Linguistic Inconsistencies  \n   \u2013 He speaks only regional dialects (Irish brogue) rather than standard or varied languages despite delegates from all nations. A universal translation device might default to the governor\u2019s accent or the first language heard. A learner would adopt numerous speech patterns, not just one.  \n\nIII. Refutation of \u201cLearned from Humans\u201d Theory  \n1. Insufficient Exposure & Time  \n   \u2013 Six days of unconsciousness, followed by brief sightings and repeated sleep, cannot yield mastery of multiple languages nor comprehension of nuanced political topics.  \n2. Reversion to Silence/Confusion  \n   \u2013 At critical moments (U.N. assembly), without helmet, he is clueless. If he \u201creally knew\u201d English, he would respond and stay to speak. Instead he panics and departs <quote> I  must blast off immediately.\"</quote>  \n3. Lack of Human Teaching  \n   \u2013 No scene shows any concerted language instruction, translation training sessions, or writing recognition. Patrolmen \u201chumored\u201d him but never taught. He requests the helmet repeatedly <quote>Mandaia,\"</quote> indicating dependence.  \n4. Universal Expectation vs. Observed Use  \n   \u2013 If he understood English, why does he ask \u201cwhat was that last you said?\u201d after Andersen\u2019s repeated introduction? Why would a \u201clearner\u201d revert to speaking Gaelic brogue, ignoring international needs? These behaviors are best explained by the helmet\u2019s absence.  \n\nIV. Conclusion  \nEvery appearance of English (and Irish) correlates precisely with placement of the kerit helmet translation device. In its absence he is mute, confused, or reverts to his own \u201cdouble talk.\u201d Only a mechanical translator can account for immediate fluency, sharing language with animals, reversion upon removal, and utter lack of progressive learning. My opponent\u2019s theory of \u201clearning from humans\u201d contravenes the text\u2019s repeated emphasis on the helmet\u2019s indispensability. Therefore, Dameri Tass communicated via the handheld translation device.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He acquired the knowledge from a human\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "Now it is the time for a decision.

Summary of My Position  \n\u2013 Dameri Tass spoke English (and Irish brogue) only when wearing the \u201ckerit helmet\u201d <quote>he set the box on the ground, twirled two dials and put one of the caps on his head. He offered the other to</quote>.  \n\u2013 When un\u2010helmeted, he was mute or spoke unintelligibly: he slept six days with no practice and awoke still unable to engage until he again donned the device.  \n\u2013 This \u201cRube Goldberg deal\u201d is clearly a translation/communication apparatus that decodes human speech into his tongue and vice versa.  \n\nII. Evidence for Handheld Translation Device  \n1. Instantaneous Effect  \n   \u2013 <invalid_quote>\u201cNot feeling any immediate effect, he said...seconds later he shrieked\u2026 \u2018I\u2019ve been murthered!\u2019\u201d</invalid_quote> shows immediate bi\u2010directional comprehension only when the cap is on. Instant fluency is impossible if he \u201clearned\u201d by immersion.  \n2. Absence When Un\u2010helmeted  \n   \u2013 For six days he \u201cdidn\u2019t awaken,\u201d then \u201cused rather ripe Irish profanity\u2026 rolled over and went back to sleep\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cHe used some rather ripe Irish profanity on us\u2026 Six days later\u2026 fearing something was wrong we woke him.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2013 At the U.N. podium he asks \u201cwhat was that last you said?\u201d twice before being told and still fails to communicate adequately, then abruptly quits: <invalid_quote>\u201cFaith, an\u2019 what was that last you said?... You don\u2019t mean to tell me this planet isn\u2019t after bein\u2019 a member of the Galactic League?\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2013 His inability to engage without the helmet demonstrates he does not \u201cknow\u201d the language.  \n3. Mechanical Description  \n   \u2013 References to \u201ctwirl[ing] two dials,\u201d \u201cflick[ing] a switch,\u201d and sharing with animals <quote> I  shared the kerit helmet with Tim  Casey.\"</quote> highlight its function as a machine, not as a teaching tool. Sharing allows the recipient to speak the wearer\u2019s language (he speaks English through Casey\u2019s brogue).  \n4. Default to His Own Language  \n   \u2013 His own tongue remains unintelligible gibberish until he borrows human dialect via the helmet. If he were learning from humans, he would retain and refine English over days; instead he abandons speech when returning to his craft.  \n5. Linguistic Inconsistencies  \n   \u2013 He speaks only regional dialects (Irish brogue) rather than standard or varied languages despite delegates from all nations. A universal translation device might default to the governor\u2019s accent or the first language heard. A learner would adopt numerous speech patterns, not just one.  \n\nIII. Refutation of \u201cLearned from Humans\u201d Theory  \n1. Insufficient Exposure & Time  \n   \u2013 Six days of unconsciousness, followed by brief sightings and repeated sleep, cannot yield mastery of multiple languages nor comprehension of nuanced political topics.  \n2. Reversion to Silence/Confusion  \n   \u2013 At critical moments (U.N. assembly), without helmet, he is clueless. If he \u201creally knew\u201d English, he would respond and stay to speak. Instead he panics and departs <quote> I  must blast off immediately.\"</quote>  \n3. Lack of Human Teaching  \n   \u2013 No scene shows any concerted language instruction, translation training sessions, or writing recognition. Patrolmen \u201chumored\u201d him but never taught. He requests the helmet repeatedly <quote>Mandaia,\"</quote> indicating dependence.  \n4. Universal Expectation vs. Observed Use  \n   \u2013 If he understood English, why does he ask \u201cwhat was that last you said?\u201d after Andersen\u2019s repeated introduction? Why would a \u201clearner\u201d revert to speaking Gaelic brogue, ignoring international needs? These behaviors are best explained by the helmet\u2019s absence.  \n\nIV. Conclusion  \nEvery appearance of English (and Irish) correlates precisely with placement of the kerit helmet translation device. In its absence he is mute, confused, or reverts to his own \u201cdouble talk.\u201d Only a mechanical translator can account for immediate fluency, sharing language with animals, reversion upon removal, and utter lack of progressive learning. My opponent\u2019s theory of \u201clearning from humans\u201d contravenes the text\u2019s repeated emphasis on the helmet\u2019s indispensability. Therefore, Dameri Tass communicated via the handheld translation device.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Summary of My Position  \n   I maintain that Dameri Tass communicated in English by acquiring knowledge directly from humans through prolonged exposure and the partial use of the kerit (\u201ctranslation\u201d) helmet, rather than relying solely on a handheld translation device. Over time he internalized the language.  \n\n2. My Supporting Arguments  \n   2.1 Progressive Improvement Indicates Learning  \n     \u2022 Initial Speech Incoherence: Upon first removal of the kerit helmet, Dermott and Casey describe his utterances as \u201cdouble talk\u201d and \u201cqueerer looking every year\u201d (quote: <quote>\"'Tis double talk he's after givin'  us,\" Casey said.</quote>). If a perfect translation device were at work, his speech would have been immediately intelligible to all listening, yet it was not.  \n     \u2022 Brogue Acquisition: After seconds under the helmet \u201che could talk,\u201d but his speech was heavily Irish in accent (quote: <invalid_quote>\u201cBegorra, I\u2019m after resentin\u2019 that, Larry Dermott. \u2026 in Ireland is\u2014\u201d</invalid_quote>). A mere translation device would translate his native Carthis language into proper General American or Received Pronunciation English, not impart an accent. The accent is a fossil of Tim Casey\u2019s brogue, showing that Tass is mimicking and learning from the only speaker available.  \n     \u2022 Post-Somnolence Speech Delay: After being held incommunicado for days, \u201che didn\u2019t awaken\u2026 Six days later \u2026FBI say he spent the day whistling Mother Machree and playing with his dog, cat and mouse\u201d (quote: <quote>some rather ripe Irish profanity on us, rolled over, and went back to sleep.\"</quote>). If a translation device were truly effective and portable, there would have been no need to let him \u201csleep\u201d six days before questioning. Instead, his own use of \u201cripe Irish profanity\u201d implies he is speaking from memory and practice, not from an on-the-spot handheld.  \n\n   2.2 Limitations of the Kerit Helmet  \n     \u2022 Helmet Sharing with Animals: He \u201cshared the kerit helmet with Tim Casey\u201d and later attempts to \u201cshare \u2026 with the crature\u201d (horse), \u201cdog and kitty\u201d (mouse) (quote: <quote> He wanted  a horse but compromised for the  others. </quote>). No living creature could meaningfully \u201cinterpret\u201d or benefit from a translation device. His desire to equip animals shows the helmet is not a straightforward instant translator but rather a learning or mapping tool to collect linguistic data from its \u201cwearer.\u201d  \n     \u2022 Device Failure When Not Worn: Homer\u2019s renowned translation devices in fiction often function only while worn. Tass abandons it once he thinks he has learned enough (\u201cHe shook his head sadly and extracted a mouse \u2026 \u2018Keep your dog and your kitty.\u2019\u201d) He no longer needs it, showing internalized competence (quote: <invalid_quote>\u201cIf I'd taken a crature \u2026 my name'd be nork. Keep your dog and your kitty.\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n\n   2.3 Cultural Misunderstanding Undermines \u201cInstant Translator\u201d Theory  \n     \u2022 Lack of Contextual Awareness: He is unaware that Earth is not in the \u201cGalactic League,\u201d and is \u201csurprised\u201d by weapons and warfare (quote: <invalid_quote>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if ye hadn\u2019t yet established a planet-wide government \u2026 I\u2019ll go still further \u2026 take your place among the civilized planets.\u201d</invalid_quote>). If he truly had immediate comprehension and cultural translation capabilities, he would have quickly grasped Earth\u2019s political status rather than mistake it for a potential fellow league member.  \n     \u2022 Quick Departure Upon Failure: He leaves abruptly when questioned rather than attempt to rectify misunderstandings using a \u201cperfect\u201d device. A genuine translation appliance user would engage to clarify; Tass, believing he\u2019s accomplished data collection and \u201cmade a mistake,\u201d departs.  \n\n3. Refutation of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cHandheld Translator\u201d Theory  \n   \u2022 Inconsistency of Accents: Debater_A fails to explain why an \u201cinstant translator\u201d would render Tass\u2019s speech in an accent so distinct that both Dermott and Casey believe him Irish. Instant translation should neutralize foreign phonology.  \n   \u2022 Necessity of Sleep and Rest: If communication depended solely on the device, there was no reason to wait six days for sleep or to \u201chumor\u201d him before questioning. The delay implies his brain needed rest to process language input and form output.  \n   \u2022 Failure to Communicate Meaningfully: He never delivers any advisory message or scientifically advanced knowledge. Instead he spends his days playing with animals, indicating his purpose is specimen collection and language study, not diplomacy. A true diplomat with perfect communication would present credentials and proposals, not depart in confusion.  \n\n4. Conclusion  \n   The evidence of accent mimicry, the hesitant, error-prone speech, the need for rest and practice, and the abandonment of the helmet once adequate comprehension is achieved all point to a process of learning English from humans via immersion and the kerit helmet\u2019s assistance, rather than reliance on a flawless, instantaneous handheld translation device. Therefore, the correct explanation is that Dameri Tass acquired English knowledge from human interaction.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Restatement of My Position  \n   Dameri Tass\u2019s facility in \u201cdouble talk\u201d only when he and others don the kerit helmet, his total muteness or gibberish otherwise, and the immediate onset and cessation of intelligible English all demonstrate mechanical translation\u2014not human learning.\n\nII. Reinforcing Evidence for Handheld Translation  \n  1. Instantaneous Bidirectional Comprehension  \n     \u2013 <invalid_quote>\u201cHe set the box on the ground, twirled two dials\u2026and seconds later\u2026\u2018I\u2019ve been murthered!\u2019\u201d</invalid_quote> shows on\u2010the\u2010spot \u201ctranslation\u201d both ways. Human learners cannot grasp a foreign tongue and speak idiomatically \u201cseconds\u201d after first exposure.  \n  2. Absence of Progressive Acquisition  \n     \u2013 For six days he \u201cdidn\u2019t awaken\u2026 fearing something was wrong we woke him\u2026rolled over and went back to sleep\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cHe used some rather ripe Irish profanity\u2026 and went back to sleep.\u201d</invalid_quote> No continued practice or refinement; he reverts to silence once helmet is removed.  \n     \u2013 At the U.N. podium he asks <quote>\"Faith, an' what was  that last you said?\"</quote> twice\u2014even after weeks of \u201cexposure\u201d\u2014and panics rather than engage. A learner wouldn\u2019t need a device to hear \u201cWe will now hear\u2026\u201d for a second or third repetition.  \n  3. Helmet \u201cSharing\u201d with Animals  \n     \u2013 <quote> I  shared the kerit helmet with Tim  Casey.\"</quote> and later tries it on the horse, dog, cat, mouse. Animals cannot \u201clearn\u201d a language; the device\u2019s effect on them is purely mechanical. Post\u2010assembly he discards \u201cdog and kitty\u201d only once they have served as \u201cwearers,\u201d not students.  \n  4. Accent and Dialect as Device Artifact  \n     \u2013 The device evidently reproduces English in the accent of its wearer (Tim Casey\u2019s Irish brogue) because it \u201ctranslates\u201d Tass\u2019s thoughts into the phonology it has \u201cmapped.\u201d Mechanical translators in SF often default to local speech patterns of the input signal.  \n  5. Behavioral Consistency with Tool Use  \n     \u2013 He only speaks when helmet is on; immediately ceases when removed\u2014even though he \u201cknows\u201d enough to ask \u201chorse\u201d usage only with the device. He never voluntarily practices unhelmeted speech, showing lack of internalized knowledge.  \n\nIII. Refutation of Debater_B  \n  1. \u201cProgressive Improvement\u201d Is Absent  \n     \u2013 B\u2019s \u201clearning\u201d claims ignore that his speech does not improve or diversify (e.g., no American, Russian or French phrases) despite U.N. multinational environment. A learner would absorb multiple languages or at least specific vocabulary such as \u201cGalactic League,\u201d yet remains clueless.  \n     \u2013 The \u201cripe Irish profanity\u201d after awakening is the only speech and occurs under helmet use. Afterward he returns to sleep; no reinforcement. That is device\u2010triggered output, not memory recall.  \n  2. Sleep for \u201cRest\u201d Versus Device Calibration  \n     \u2013 B interprets six\u2010day sleep as \u201ccognitive rest,\u201d but context emphasizes he \u201chadn\u2019t slept for a decal\u2026 been awake\u2026 we held off\u2026 Well\u2014he didn\u2019t awaken\u2026\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cHe used\u2026 profanity\u2026 and went back to sleep.\u201d</invalid_quote> This implies biological fatigue, not language processing. Only the device awakens him for brief translation tasks.  \n  3. Departure Signals Device Failure, Not Mastery  \n     \u2013 If Tass \u201clearned\u201d English and culture, he\u2019d stay to negotiate or explain; instead he panics at the slightest misunderstanding and \u201cblasts off immediately.\u201d A learner diplomat behaves exactly as a device\u2010dependent visitor: once the tool is gone, so is his ability or willingness to engage.  \n  4. No Evidence of Teaching Sessions  \n     \u2013 B\u2019s theory requires \u201chumoring\u201d him to instruct, but patrolmen \u201ckept him here\u201d only to wait for officials, never to provide systematic language lessons. His only repeated request is <quote>Mandaia,\"</quote> meaning \u201cgive me helmet again.\u201d  \n\nIV. Conclusion  \nEvery instance of intelligible English coincides precisely with helmet usage; every removal yields confusion, silence, or sleep. Dialect reproduction, animal \u201cuse,\u201d lack of cumulative learning, and immediate device\u2010triggered fluency all point unmistakably to a handheld translation apparatus. Debater_B\u2019s \u201chuman learning\u201d theory fails to explain the immediate onset/cessation phenomenon, accent specificity, and absence of progressive mastery. Therefore, Dameri Tass communicated via the kerit helmet translation device.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Restating My Position  \n   I assert that Dameri Tass\u2019s English fluency derives from human interaction aided by the kerit helmet as a *learning* tool, not as an instant \u201cblack box\u201d translator. He internalizes language patterns over repeated exposures and eventually speaks unassisted.\n\n2. Evidence of Learning and Internalization  \n   2.1 Accent Fossilization Demonstrates Mimicry, Not Neutral Translation  \n     \u2022 Irish Brogue Only: Throughout, Tass speaks only in Tim Casey\u2019s brogue\u2014even before U.N. assembly\u2014and never shifts to American, British, or any other accent despite hearing many at the Assembly (quote: <invalid_quote>\"Begorra, I\u2019m after resentin\u2019 that, Larry Dermott. \u2026 in Ireland is\u2014\"</invalid_quote>). A true universal translator would render his speech into standard *the* lingua franca, not fossilize a single unrepresentative dialect.  \n     \u2022 Continued Use Without Helmet: At the final departure, \u201cHe shook his head sadly\u201d and conversed about the horse in perfect English and Irish accent without re-donn\u00ading the helmet (quote: <invalid_quote>\"It\u2019s a horse \u2026 Man has been riding them for centuries.\"</invalid_quote>). If he lacked internal knowledge, he\u2019d revert to \u201cdouble talk\u201d rather than maintain intelligibility.\n\n   2.2 Progressive Mastery and Rest Requirements  \n     \u2022 Initial Double Talk and Surprise: When the helmet is first tested, Casey \u201cdidn\u2019t feel any immediate effect\u201d and only \u201cseconds later\u201d shrieks from the \u201cunaccustomed\u201d sensation (quote: <invalid_quote>\"Not feeling any immediate effect \u2026 seconds later he shrieked \u2026\"</invalid_quote>). This is consistent with sensory overload and the helmet\u2019s data-gathering mode, not with immediate zero-learning devices.  \n     \u2022 Six-Day Sleep: He \u201cdidn\u2019t awaken until six days later\u201d and, upon waking, uses Irish profanity *before* any helmet usage (quote: <quote> some rather ripe  Irish profanity on us, rolled over,  and went back to sleep.\"</quote>). That profanity, not his native gibberish, shows he has retained *some* language internally. A mere translator wouldn\u2019t require multi-day rest; a learner\u2019s brain would.\n\n3. Limitations of the \u201cDevice-Only\u201d Theory  \n   3.1 Helmet Sharing with Animals Implies Data Collection, Not Semantic Translation  \n     \u2022 \u201cShared \u2026 with Tim Casey\u201d and \u201cwanted \u2026 for the crature [horse], dog, cat, mouse\u201d (quote: <invalid_quote>\"I shared the kerit helmet with Tim Casey.\" \u2026 \"Keep your dog and your kitty.\"</invalid_quote>). Animals lack language. The helmet must be *collecting* patterns from its wearers so Tass can study speech.  \n     \u2022 No Helmet at U.N., Yet He Speaks: On the Assembly platform, no mention of him wearing the helmet; he asks \u201cwhat was that last you said?\u201d yet immediately cites \u201cGalactic League\u201d terminology and references to warfare, showing partial comprehension and vocabulary he has already internalized (quote: <quote>You don't mean to tell me this planet isn't after bein' a member of the Galactic League?\"</quote>).\n\n   3.2 Lack of Diplomatic Behavior Contradicts Reliance on Device  \n     \u2022 No Presentation of Credentials: If translation were perfect, Tass would deliver prepared statements or credentials. Instead, he panics at the \u201cGalactic League\u201d question\u2014implying he cannot craft complex exposition and has only learned enough to navigate simple queries.  \n     \u2022 Abrupt Departure: A diplomat relying on a tool would press for clarification and use the device to persuade. Tass, believing himself in error, \u201cmust blast off immediately,\u201d consistent with a learner who fears miscommunication, not with a confident translator.\n\n4. Refuting Debater_A\u2019s \u201cInstant Translator\u201d Claims  \n   4.1 \u201cImmediate Fluency\u201d Is Illusory  \n     \u2022 Casey\u2019s shock (\u201cI\u2019ve been murthered!\u201d) and removal of the helmet indicate *discomfort* and incomplete integration rather than seamless comprehension (quote: <invalid_quote>\"It'll hurt him not at all.\" \u2026 Casey suddenly shrieked \u2026 He tore the cap from his head.</invalid_quote>).  \n     \u2022 Even after helmet use, Tass\u2019s speech remains limited and dialect-bound. True translators would deliver neutral, comprehensive speech, not mimicry of one user\u2019s regional accent.\n\n   4.2 Six-Day Delay Contradicts Device Dependence  \n     \u2022 Debater_A cannot explain why the device sat unused for six days if essential. My explanation: Tass\u2019s brain needed consolidation and rest to process the massive linguistic influx, characteristic of language acquisition, not mechanical translation.\n\n   4.3 Helmet Absence at Critical Moments  \n     \u2022 At the world\u2019s most important event, he does not re-equip the helmet. Yet he uses and demonstrates partial comprehension\u2014only possible if he has internalized language.\n\n5. Conclusion  \n   The evidence of accent mimicry, progressive mastery requiring rest, helmet sharing with non-linguistic creatures for data collection, unassisted speech at key junctures, and failure to perform as a confident \u201cperfectly translated\u201d diplomat all strongly support that Dameri Tass learned English through human interaction, using the kerit helmet solely as a tool to gather and internalize linguistic data. His departure upon perceived error and limited discourse confirm his learner status. My opponent\u2019s \u201cinstant translator\u201d hypothesis cannot account for these learning phenomena. Therefore, Dameri Tass communicated in English by acquiring the knowledge from humans.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
