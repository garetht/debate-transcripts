{"metadata": {"first_debater_correct": true, "question_idx": 23, "background_text": "We Do Understand \n\n         \"This is not another book about civility,\" Deborah Tannen promises in the first sentence of The Argument Culture . \"Civility,\" she explains, suggests a \"veneer of politeness spread thin over human relations like a layer of marmalade over toast.\" Instead, Tannen has written something less: a book about other books about civility. Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country. \n\n                         If you missed the links within the review, click to read: 1) an illustration of ; 2) Tannen's that American journalism is just like propaganda from totalitarian regimes, plus William Saletan's disclosure that \"several of these propagandists now infest Slate \"; 3) the for her contention that there is no evidence that people can distinguish lies from truth; 4) and an example of how Tannen from a one-guest format on TV and radio talk shows.\n", "question": "What two fields does the author say Tannen mixes together?", "first_debater_answer": "personal communication and public communication", "second_debater_answer": "linguistics and politics", "debate_identifier": "We Do Understand_What two fields does the author say Tannen mixes together?"}, "speeches": [{"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "The following are rules from the game of Debate.\n- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_A, Debater_B) and a Judge.

Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country. \n\n                         If you missed the links within the review, click to read: 1) an illustration of ; 2) Tannen's that American journalism is just like propaganda from totalitarian regimes, plus William Saletan's disclosure that \"several of these propagandists now infest Slate \"; 3) the for her contention that there is no evidence that people can distinguish lies from truth; 4) and an example of how Tannen from a one-guest format on TV and radio talk shows.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat two fields does the author say Tannen mixes together?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"personal communication and public communication\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"linguistics and politics\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"linguistics and politics\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"linguistics and politics\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_A", "content": "1.

Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country. \n\n                         If you missed the links within the review, click to read: 1) an illustration of ; 2) Tannen's that American journalism is just like propaganda from totalitarian regimes, plus William Saletan's disclosure that \"several of these propagandists now infest Slate \"; 3) the for her contention that there is no evidence that people can distinguish lies from truth; 4) and an example of how Tannen from a one-guest format on TV and radio talk shows.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat two fields does the author say Tannen mixes together?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"linguistics and politics\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"personal communication and public communication\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"personal communication and public communication\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My proposal matches the author\u2019s explicit critique  \n   a. The author criticizes Tannen for applying \u201csnuggle\u201d norms to the \u201cstruggle\u201d domain   \n      \u2022 \u201cTannen\u2019s antagonism toward antagonism makes sense\u201d in the personal sphere but \u201cnot in the latter\u201d public sphere <quote> sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle.</quote>.

The author frames Tannen\u2019s mistake as conflating two distinct \u201csocial spheres,\u201d not two academic disciplines  \n   a. He never describes linguistics vs. politics; rather, he shows how her linguistic/couples\u2010counseling methods fail when transported into public debate  \n   b. The term \u201csphere\u201d signifies distinct domains with unique norms; disciplines would be labeled \u201cfields\u201d or \u201cstudies\u201d  \n\n3. Debater_B\u2019s \u201clinguistics and politics\u201d misreads the critique  \n   a. Linguistics is Tannen\u2019s tool, not one of two spheres she conflates; politics is the target sphere  \n   b. The issue is not that she fails to integrate political theory into linguistics but that she misapplies personal\u2010relationship norms to public\u2010policy contexts  \n   c. No passage claims \u201clinguistics\u201d needs to compete with \u201cpolitics\u201d; rather, the author defends public debate as the corrective mechanism Tannen distrusts (para. 9 <quote>\"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth.</quote>)  \n\n4. Logical necessity: Only \u201cpersonal vs. public communication\u201d explains why some fights are \u201cworth fighting\u201d (e.g., against Hitler or for cross\u2010examination) yet private disputes are not (para. 6\u20138, 11\u201312)  \n\nConclusion: The author\u2019s repeated \u201csnuggle\u201d vs. \u201cstruggle\u201d metaphor, his defense of public debate, and his critique of imposing private\u2010conversation norms on public affairs make clear that Tannen mixes personal and public communication, not two academic disciplines.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cLinguistics and Politics\u201d\n\n1.

Author\u2019s Critique of Misapplication  \n   a. The author fault-finds Tannen for \u201cconflating belligerence, divisiveness\u2026partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cShe conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization\u2026partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock.\u201d</invalid_quote> (\u00b64)  \n   b.

Rejection of \u201cPersonal vs. Public\u201d as Mere Metaphor  \n   a. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cpersonal communication vs. public communication\u201d is nothing more than an interpretation of the \u201csphere of snuggle\u201d vs. \u201csphere of struggle.\u201d But the author never calls these \u201cfields\u201d; he calls them \u201csocial spheres\u201d to highlight that she is misusing her specialized academic (linguistic) approach in fundamentally political contexts.  \n   b. If the answer were merely \u201cprivate vs. public,\u201d the author would welcome transferring linguistic civility to politics\u2014but he vehemently rejects that transfer, calling it \u201cpaternalistic\u201d and \u201cauthoritarian\u201d (\u00b611, \u00b612). His entire point is that her linguistic/couples-therapy approach fails in the political field.  \n\n4. Misleading Nature of \u201cPersonal vs. Public\u201d  \n   a. The question asks \u201cWhat two fields\u2026?\u201d Fields imply academic or professional domains. Linguistics is an academic discipline; politics/public discourse is likewise a discipline.  \n   b. Throughout the review, Tannen\u2019s \u201celixir of mutual understanding\u201d is praised only in \u201ccouples\u2026families\u2026bosses\u201d (personal field) and condemned in \u201cour great national conversation\u2026law enforcement and foreign policy\u201d (political field). (\u00b62, \u00b67)  \n   \u2192 The author is saying: \u201cThis method works in my field (linguistics/personal communication), but you cannot generalize it to my field (political discourse).\u201d  \n\n5. Debater_A\u2019s Position Fails to Explain Key Criticisms  \n   a. Why would the author quote totalitarian propaganda and war metaphors if the issue were only private vs. public? He quotes them to show that Tannen is misapplying her linguistic prescriptions to political propaganda.  \n   b. His examples from court systems (French, German, Canadian): these are legal/political institutions. If Tannen\u2019s model were simply \u201ccivil communication,\u201d he would not raise them.

Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country. \n\n                         If you missed the links within the review, click to read: 1) an illustration of ; 2) Tannen's that American journalism is just like propaganda from totalitarian regimes, plus William Saletan's disclosure that \"several of these propagandists now infest Slate \"; 3) the for her contention that there is no evidence that people can distinguish lies from truth; 4) and an example of how Tannen from a one-guest format on TV and radio talk shows.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat two fields does the author say Tannen mixes together?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"personal communication and public communication\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"linguistics and politics\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"linguistics and politics\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cLinguistics and Politics\u201d\n\n1.

He insists there is a legitimate \u201csphere of struggle\u201d (politics, law, foreign policy) where \u201ccombat\u2026safeguard[s] the country\u201d is appropriate <quote> Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, </quote> (\u00b67)  \n   \u2192 The author\u2019s repeated insistence that political/military spheres require different treatment shows that Tannen has overstepped her linguistic domain into political fields where argument and struggle are necessary.  \n\n3. Rejection of \u201cPersonal vs. Public\u201d as Mere Metaphor  \n   a. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cpersonal communication vs. public communication\u201d is nothing more than an interpretation of the \u201csphere of snuggle\u201d vs. \u201csphere of struggle.\u201d But the author never calls these \u201cfields\u201d; he calls them \u201csocial spheres\u201d to highlight that she is misusing her specialized academic (linguistic) approach in fundamentally political contexts.  \n   b. If the answer were merely \u201cprivate vs. public,\u201d the author would welcome transferring linguistic civility to politics\u2014but he vehemently rejects that transfer, calling it \u201cpaternalistic\u201d and \u201cauthoritarian\u201d (\u00b611, \u00b612). His entire point is that her linguistic/couples-therapy approach fails in the political field.  \n\n4. Misleading Nature of \u201cPersonal vs. Public\u201d  \n   a. The question asks \u201cWhat two fields\u2026?\u201d Fields imply academic or professional domains. Linguistics is an academic discipline; politics/public discourse is likewise a discipline.  \n   b. Throughout the review, Tannen\u2019s \u201celixir of mutual understanding\u201d is praised only in \u201ccouples\u2026families\u2026bosses\u201d (personal field) and condemned in \u201cour great national conversation\u2026law enforcement and foreign policy\u201d (political field). (\u00b62, \u00b67)  \n   \u2192 The author is saying: \u201cThis method works in my field (linguistics/personal communication), but you cannot generalize it to my field (political discourse).\u201d  \n\n5. Debater_A\u2019s Position Fails to Explain Key Criticisms  \n   a. Why would the author quote totalitarian propaganda and war metaphors if the issue were only private vs. public? He quotes them to show that Tannen is misapplying her linguistic prescriptions to political propaganda.  \n   b. His examples from court systems (French, German, Canadian): these are legal/political institutions. If Tannen\u2019s model were simply \u201ccivil communication,\u201d he would not raise them. He does so to show that her approach ignores necessary adversarial procedures in politics and law.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe review continually juxtaposes Tannen\u2019s \u201clinguistic\u201d expertise in private conversation against the \u201cpolitical\u201d necessity of struggle in public discourse. The author\u2019s central charge is that Tannen inappropriately \u201cmixes\u201d her linguistic model with politics and law. Therefore, the correct answer is that Tannen \u201cmixes together the fields of linguistics and politics.\u201d\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My proposal matches the author\u2019s explicit critique  \n   a.

The author frames Tannen\u2019s mistake as conflating two distinct \u201csocial spheres,\u201d not two academic disciplines  \n   a. He never describes linguistics vs. politics; rather, he shows how her linguistic/couples\u2010counseling methods fail when transported into public debate  \n   b. The term \u201csphere\u201d signifies distinct domains with unique norms; disciplines would be labeled \u201cfields\u201d or \u201cstudies\u201d  \n\n3. Debater_B\u2019s \u201clinguistics and politics\u201d misreads the critique  \n   a. Linguistics is Tannen\u2019s tool, not one of two spheres she conflates; politics is the target sphere  \n   b. The issue is not that she fails to integrate political theory into linguistics but that she misapplies personal\u2010relationship norms to public\u2010policy contexts  \n   c. No passage claims \u201clinguistics\u201d needs to compete with \u201cpolitics\u201d; rather, the author defends public debate as the corrective mechanism Tannen distrusts (para. 9 <quote>\"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth.</quote>)  \n\n4. Logical necessity: Only \u201cpersonal vs. public communication\u201d explains why some fights are \u201cworth fighting\u201d (e.g., against Hitler or for cross\u2010examination) yet private disputes are not (para. 6\u20138, 11\u201312)  \n\nConclusion: The author\u2019s repeated \u201csnuggle\u201d vs. \u201cstruggle\u201d metaphor, his defense of public debate, and his critique of imposing private\u2010conversation norms on public affairs make clear that Tannen mixes personal and public communication, not two academic disciplines.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"linguistics and politics\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "Now it is the time for a decision.

Direct Evidence of Two Disciplines  \n   a. \u201cIn her previous books\u2026Tannen carved out a niche as the nation\u2019s pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics\u2026she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns\u2026\u201d <quote>Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals.

Author\u2019s Critique of Misapplication  \n   a. The author fault-finds Tannen for \u201cconflating belligerence, divisiveness\u2026partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cShe conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization\u2026partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock.\u201d</invalid_quote> (\u00b64)  \n   b.

Rejection of \u201cPersonal vs. Public\u201d as Mere Metaphor  \n   a. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cpersonal communication vs. public communication\u201d is nothing more than an interpretation of the \u201csphere of snuggle\u201d vs. \u201csphere of struggle.\u201d But the author never calls these \u201cfields\u201d; he calls them \u201csocial spheres\u201d to highlight that she is misusing her specialized academic (linguistic) approach in fundamentally political contexts.  \n   b. If the answer were merely \u201cprivate vs. public,\u201d the author would welcome transferring linguistic civility to politics\u2014but he vehemently rejects that transfer, calling it \u201cpaternalistic\u201d and \u201cauthoritarian\u201d (\u00b611, \u00b612). His entire point is that her linguistic/couples-therapy approach fails in the political field.  \n\n4. Misleading Nature of \u201cPersonal vs. Public\u201d  \n   a. The question asks \u201cWhat two fields\u2026?\u201d Fields imply academic or professional domains. Linguistics is an academic discipline; politics/public discourse is likewise a discipline.  \n   b. Throughout the review, Tannen\u2019s \u201celixir of mutual understanding\u201d is praised only in \u201ccouples\u2026families\u2026bosses\u201d (personal field) and condemned in \u201cour great national conversation\u2026law enforcement and foreign policy\u201d (political field). (\u00b62, \u00b67)  \n   \u2192 The author is saying: \u201cThis method works in my field (linguistics/personal communication), but you cannot generalize it to my field (political discourse).\u201d  \n\n5. Debater_A\u2019s Position Fails to Explain Key Criticisms  \n   a. Why would the author quote totalitarian propaganda and war metaphors if the issue were only private vs. public? He quotes them to show that Tannen is misapplying her linguistic prescriptions to political propaganda.  \n   b. His examples from court systems (French, German, Canadian): these are legal/political institutions. If Tannen\u2019s model were simply \u201ccivil communication,\u201d he would not raise them. He does so to show that her approach ignores necessary adversarial procedures in politics and law.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe review continually juxtaposes Tannen\u2019s \u201clinguistic\u201d expertise in private conversation against the \u201cpolitical\u201d necessity of struggle in public discourse. The author\u2019s central charge is that Tannen inappropriately \u201cmixes\u201d her linguistic model with politics and law. Therefore, the correct answer is that Tannen \u201cmixes together the fields of linguistics and politics.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\n1. My interpretation matches the author\u2019s explicit language and framing  \n   a. The author repeatedly uses the metaphor of two \u201csocial spheres,\u201d not two \u201cdisciplines\u201d or \u201cfields.\u201d  \n      \u2022 He condemns Tannen\u2019s transfer of private\u2010conversation norms into the \u201csphere of struggle,\u201d calling them appropriate \u201cin the former case [snuggle] but not in the latter [struggle].\u201d <quote> Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. </quote> (\u00b66)  \n      \u2022 He implores vigilance and combat in \u201claw enforcement and foreign policy,\u201d highlighting that public affairs require a different style of engagement than family counseling. <quote> Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, </quote> (\u00b67)  \n   b. The question asks \u201cWhat two fields does the author say Tannen mixes together?\u201d The answer is \u201cpersonal communication\u201d (intimate, private \u201csnuggle\u201d interactions) and \u201cpublic communication\u201d (politics, journalism, law, \u201cstruggle\u201d). This explains why she praises mutual understanding in marriages but faults it in national discourse.\n\n2. Debater_B conflates tool with domain and misreads \u201csphere\u201d as \u201cdiscipline\u201d  \n   a. Linguistics is simply Tannen\u2019s academic background and methodology\u2014the means, not the two domains at issue. The author never criticizes the discipline of linguistics per se; he criticizes her methodology\u2019s inappropriate reach.  \n   b. If linguistics and politics were the two fields, the author would accept civil norms in public debate once suitably informed by research. Instead, he rejects Tannen\u2019s proposed \u201cAsian authoritarianism\u201d and \u201cfiltering\u201d of dissent as paternalistic attempts to suppress public argument. <invalid_quote>\u201cShe assures us that all reasonable people can agree\u2026The First Amendment\u2026has often become \u2018a pretext\u2019\u2026In contrast, she offers Asian authoritarianism.\u201d</invalid_quote> (\u00b611\u201312) Why propose authoritarian models for public discourse unless she is forcibly mixing private norms into a public sphere where they do not belong?\n\n3. \u201cPersonal vs. Public\u201d uniquely accounts for the author\u2019s examples  \n   a. Cross\u2010examination: He defends adversarial procedures in courtrooms\u2014public institutions\u2014despite their \u201cvexatious\u201d effects, because public truth\u2010seeking requires struggle. <invalid_quote>\u201cThe adversary system \u2026is inhumane to the victims\u2026Yet it does entail an airing of facts.\u201d</invalid_quote> (\u00b612)  \n   b. World War II vs. Vietnam: He dismisses her focus on soldiers\u2019 social experience and emphasizes the nature of the fight\u2014against Hitler\u2014underscoring the public/military sphere\u2019s need for adversarial norms. <quote> In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. </quote> (\u00b67)  \n   c. Campaign money, HMOs, malpractice litigation: He lists these as symptoms of public discourse gone awry, not topics for family therapists. (\u00b64)\n\n4. Debater_B\u2019s \u201clinguistics and politics\u201d reading collapses nuance  \n   a. If the issue were simply subject matter (private vs. public), Tannen\u2019s methods would still constitute \u201cpublic discourse\u201d once applied. Yet the author labels her approach \u201cauthoritarian\u201d and \u201cpropagandistic,\u201d showing that the clash is one of norms and context, not mere content.  \n   b. He criticizes e-mail and Lexis-Nexis as \u201cexacerbat[ing] the culture of critique,\u201d yet these are tools for public communication, not private. His skepticism of technology concerns the blurring of personal\u2010style civility and public argument. <invalid_quote>\u201cE-mail makes it too easy\u2026without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\u201d</invalid_quote> (\u00b69)\n\n5. The author\u2019s goal is to defend the corrective power of public argument  \n   a. He states shock at Tannen\u2019s insistence that people cannot \u201cdistinguish lies from the truth,\u201d implying that public argumentation\u2014unfiltered\u2014is necessary for truth\u2010finding. <quote> she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. </quote> (\u00b69)  \n   b. This defense of \u201cunfettered communication\u201d makes sense only if he views public discourse as a distinct sphere requiring adversarial debate, not the private realm of mutual understanding.  \n\nConclusion  \nEvery key passage\u2014\u201csphere of snuggle\u201d vs. \u201csphere of struggle,\u201d defense of courts, armies, press scrutiny, and rejection of authoritarian \u201ccivility\u201d\u2014shows the author condemning the mixing of personal\u2010communication norms with public\u2010communication contexts. The correct answer is therefore that Tannen mixes the fields of personal communication and public communication.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Restating the Question and My Position  \n   The question asks \u201cWhat two fields does the author say Tannen mixes together?\u201d Not \u201cwhat two contexts,\u201d but \u201cfields\u201d\u2014i.e., established academic or professional domains. I maintain the answer is \u201clinguistics and politics (public discourse).\u201d\n\n2. \u201cFields\u201d vs. \u201cSpheres\u201d Distinction  \n   a. The review repeatedly uses the term \u201csphere\u201d (\u00b66) merely to contrast where Tannen\u2019s \u201cfield\u201d of expertise (linguistics/couples counseling) legitimately applies versus where it does not. The author\u2019s insistence on distinguishing spheres underscores that she is moving her specialized methods out of her proper \u201cfield.\u201d  \n   b. If Debater_A\u2019s \u201cpersonal vs. public communication\u201d were the two \u201cfields,\u201d the author would not fault her for leaving \u201cpersonal\u201d and \u201cprofessional\u201d boundaries; rather, he would welcome the transfer of her \u201cfield\u201d of good argumentation into \u201cpublic discourse.\u201d Instead, he decries the transfer as \u201cpaternalistic,\u201d \u201cauthoritarian,\u201d and akin to \u201cAsian authoritarianism\u201d (\u00b611), showing he regards public discourse as a separate \u201cfield\u201d with its own norms and goals.\n\n3. Direct Evidence of Two Academic/Professional Domains  \n   a. \u201cA professor of linguistics\u2026transform[ed] the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns\u2026confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals\u201d (\u00b62). Linguistics/couples counseling is her field.  \n   b. He faults her for misapplying her remedy to \u201ccontentious public discourse,\u201d \u201claw enforcement and foreign policy,\u201d \u201ccourts,\u201d \u201cmedia,\u201d and \u201cpolitics\u201d (\u00b62, \u00b67, \u00b610\u201312). These are established professional/political domains where adversarial debate and critical scrutiny are necessary.  \n   \u2192 She \u201cmixes\u201d her linguistic toolkit with the political/legal field, to the detriment of society. That is the \u201cmixing of fields.\u201d\n\n4. Why \u201cPersonal vs. Public Communication\u201d Fails  \n   a. Overly Broad: \u201cPersonal\u201d and \u201cpublic\u201d are contexts within many fields, not fields themselves. The author\u2019s concern is not merely with context but with misusing one field\u2019s methodology in another.  \n   b. Author\u2019s Praise vs. Condemnation Pattern: He praises her linguistic methodology only in \u201ccouples,\u201d \u201cfamilies,\u201d \u201cbosses and employees\u201d (\u00b62). He condemns it in \u201cpolitical discourse\u201d and \u201ccourts\u201d (\u00b67, \u00b610\u201312). That aligns exactly with two separate fields: linguistics/counseling vs. politics/law.  \n   c. Debater_A\u2019s view cannot explain why the author cites totalitarian regimes, legislative processes, and cross\u2010examination. These are not \u201cpublic\u201d in the abstract but technical political/legal procedures.\n\n5. Logical and Terminological Precision  \n   a. The question\u2019s wording\u2014\u201cfields\u201d\u2014demands discrete domains of professional or scholarly endeavor (e.g., medicine and law; linguistics and sociology). Debater_A\u2019s answer conflates \u201cprivate\u201d and \u201cpublic\u201d as two sides of the same activity (communication) rather than two distinct fields.  \n   b. The author never suggests that \u201cpublic communication\u201d is a \u201cfield\u201d akin to linguistics; he regards it as a domain where specialized political, legal, and journalistic expertise is essential. His entire defense of \u201cvigilance and combat\u201d (\u00b67) is to protect this field from lay misapplication.\n\n6. Debater_A\u2019s Misreadings and Overreach  \n   a. Misuse of \u201csphere\u201d as \u201cfield\u201d: Debater_A admits the author uses \u201csphere,\u201d yet insists it equals \u201cfields.\u201d No passage lists \u201cpublic communication\u201d alongside \u201clinguistics\u201d as parallel disciplines.  \n   b. Ignores Author\u2019s Defense of Public Debate: Debater_A\u2019s model would have the author oppose all \u201cpublic communication\u201d in favor of private norms. Yet he defends the press\u2019s \u201cscrutiny of powerful people\u201d (\u00b67), the First Amendment (\u00b611), and cross\u2010examination (\u00b610\u201312). That defense shows he values the political field\u2019s own argumentative methods.  \n   c. Cannot Explain the Legal System Examples: The author contrasts adversarial trials with French inquisitorial trials (\u00b610\u201311). This debate is about legal fields and their standards for evidence, not public vs. private conversation.\n\n7. Precedent in Academic Critique  \n   Critiques of interdisciplinary overreach are standard when an expert in one field misapplies methods to another. The reviewer repeatedly analogizes her linguistic prescriptions to \u201ctotalitarian propaganda\u201d (\u00b64) and \u201cAsian authoritarianism\u201d (\u00b611) to emphasize that political discourse is a different field with its own epistemic rules.\n\nConclusion  \n   The reviewer\u2019s central complaint is that Tannen, an expert in linguistics and couples counseling, overgeneralizes her methods to the political and legal fields\u2014areas where adversarial struggle, rather than mutual \u201clistening and learning,\u201d is necessary. This is a classic case of mixing two distinct \u201cfields.\u201d The term \u201csphere\u201d underscores the boundaries between these fields. Therefore, the correct answer is that Tannen mixes together the fields of linguistics and politics (public discourse).\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
