    "background_text": "Folie \u080e \n\n         People with high IQs tend to be nearsighted. This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital. I was actually working there, but psychiatric aides pick up so many mannerisms of the patients that it's hard to tell the difference after a while. A few years after that I found myself in a mathematics Ph.D. program. You'll be glad to know that I'm in remission.\n",

Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital.

This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare).

This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital. I was actually working there, but psychiatric aides pick up so many mannerisms of the patients that it's hard to tell the difference after a while. A few years after that I found myself in a mathematics Ph.D. program. You'll be glad to know that I'm in remission.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is true about the subject of the book the author read?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He developed mental illness as an adult but later improved\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He was born crazy but accomplished a lot in life anyway\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He was born crazy but accomplished a lot in life anyway\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI stand by the proposition that John Nash \u201cwas born crazy but accomplished a lot in life anyway.\u201d My opponent\u2019s theory\u2014that he only \u201cdeveloped mental illness as an adult but later improved\u201d\u2014fails to account for the pervasive early evidence of psychosis, the genetic predisposition, and the pleiotropic link between genius and madness described in the text. I will (1) marshal the evidence of Nash\u2019s childhood and genetic liability, (2) explain why his later achievements do not negate early insanity, and (3) show the flaws in Debater_B\u2019s adult-onset hypothesis.  \n\n1. Early Signs of Insanity Reveal Innate Madness  \n  a. Tormenting animals and making bombs (with a fatal accident) as a boy are classic indicators of conduct disorder, a precocious form of psychosis or sociopathy. <invalid_quote>\u201cAs a boy \u2026 Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs \u2026 one of whom was accidentally killed.\u201d</invalid_quote> Normal children do not show such consistent, extreme aggression.  \n  b. Obsessive secrecy and odd interpersonal behavior: even before adulthood he stood aloof and \u201ccold,\u201d implying social detachment symptomatic of schizoid traits. <quote> In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out fr</quote>  \n  c. Pleotropic genetic predisposition: the article opens by citing \u201cpleiotropy\u201d linking high IQ and myopia\u2014\u201ca quirk of evolution\u201d\u2014and then asks if mathematics and madness share the same genetic quirk. Nash exemplifies that genetic coupling from youth onward. His son \u201cinherited both his mathematical promise and his madness,\u201d reinforcing heritability.  \n\n2. Accomplishments Occur Despite, Not Because of, Early Insanity  \n  a. His rapid ascent at Princeton by age 22\u2014\u201cwithin two years \u2026 framed and proved\u201d game-theory equilibrium\u2014shows he was working through periods of clear lucidity but always battling his mental illness. Pure genius did not preclude his psychosis; it coexisted with it.  \n  b. His \u201cflamboyant lunacy\u201d continued intermittently throughout his career, including a public breakdown at age 30 (<invalid_quote>\u201cNash\u2019s talk \u2026 was a farrago of mathematical lunacy.\u201d</invalid_quote>) and decades of delusions. His later Nobel Prize at age ~70 came only after decades of chronic schizophrenia, not in spite of a newly-onset adult illness.  \n  c. Remission is rare in schizophrenia; the fact that Nasar \u201cgives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are\u201d underscores that Nash\u2019s later \u201cquiet\u201d period is exceptional, not the norm. The remission does not imply that the disorder was only adult-onset.  \n\n3. Flaws in the Adult-Onset Hypothesis  \n  a. Debater_B must explain away the early homicidal/bomb-making behavior and extreme social detachment; attributing those to normal adolescent \u201cexperimentation\u201d is implausible.  \n  b. The text explicitly equates \u201cmathematical genius\u201d with a \u201ckind of folie \u00e0 n,\u201d suggesting the mental disturbances are intrinsic to the mathematical temperament from the outset. <quote>Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n</quote> It frames madness as part of the very nature of pure mathematics, experienced by Nash and predecessors like Newton.  \n  c. If Nash\u2019s madness only \u201cdeveloped\u201d in adulthood, the long psychiatric hospitalizations and security-risk expulsions would have prevented his youthful breakthroughs. Yet he achieved his greatest mathematical feats precisely during early adulthood when his illness was already manifest.  \n\nConclusion  \nAll the evidence\u2014childhood cruelty and secrecy, genetic pleiotropy, intermittent decades-long psychosis, and the pattern of great achievements in the face of chronic illness\u2014points to Nash having been \u201cborn crazy.\u201d His later achievements and remission demonstrate the resilience of his genius, not that the illness was merely a transient adult-onset phase. My opponent\u2019s theory cannot account for the pervasive early symptoms or the genetic inheritance observed in his son. Therefore, the correct answer\u2014and the one the judge should accept\u2014is that John Nash \u201cwas born crazy but accomplished a lot in life anyway.\u201d\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy Position: \u201cHe developed mental illness as an adult but later improved.\u201d\n\nI. Claim 1: Onset of Psychosis Occurred in Adulthood  \n 1. \u201cThe big breakdown\u201d is dated to age 30.  \n   \u2013 <invalid_quote>\u201cWhen the big breakdown came \u2026 he presented his results \u2026 a farrago of mathematical lunacy.\u201d</invalid_quote> (Background)  \n   \u2013 Preceding this, he functioned normally: undergraduate studies at Carnegie Tech, rapid progress at Princeton, proof of Nash equilibrium.  \n 2. No clinical insanity reported in childhood or adolescence.  \n   \u2013 Childhood anecdotes (animal torture, bombs) reflect antisocial behavior, not schizophrenia.  \n   \u2013 Schizophrenia typically emerges in early adulthood, matching Nash\u2019s timeline.  \n\nII. Claim 2: Prolonged Period of Severe Symptoms Followed by Remission  \n 1. Decades of flamboyant psychosis:  \n   \u2013 Lewd acts, bizarre delusions (emperor of Antarctica, aliens in the New York Times).  \n   \u2013 Hospitalizations, insulin-induced comas.  \n   \u2013 <quote> Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, </quote>  \n 2. Rare spontaneous remission in the 1990s:  \n   \u2013 Voices \u201cbegan to quiet down\u201d; Nobel Prize ceremony went without incident.  \n   \u2013 Ex-wife and students note his return to \u201cvery fine person.\u201d  \n   \u2013 Evidence of genuine recovery rather than lifelong baseline:  \n     \u2022 Nobel awarded decades after initial work, indicating restored reputation and functionality.  \n\nIII. Claim 3: Remission Enabled Productive Late-Life Functioning  \n 1. Awarded Nobel Prize\u2014requires coherence and public interaction.  \n   \u2013 Nobel committee risked honor; he \u201cdid fine at the ceremony.\u201d  \n 2. Supports son, lives modestly on Nobel funds; engages campus life as \u201cPhantom\u201d less disruptively.  \n 3. Author himself was in psychiatric work and later in remission, suggesting belief in treatable adult-onset illness.  \n\nIV. Objections to Debater_A\u2019s \u201cBorn Crazy\u201d Thesis  \n 1. Childhood conduct \u2260 schizophrenia.  \n   \u2013 Animal cruelty lacks core psychotic symptoms: hallucinations, fixed delusions, disorganized thought.  \n 2. Genius mathematicians often eccentric; author notes \u201ccold and aloof Southerner,\u201d not delusional.  \n 3. Delusions tied to his pursuit of the Riemann Zeta conjecture: classical \u201cgrandiose\u201d symptom coinciding with academic stress.  \n 4. Remission improbable if lifelong: schizophrenia remissions are rare and incomplete; Nash\u2019s full social reintegration argues adult-onset.  \n 5. The pleiotropy analogy: mental illness \u201cslipping\u201d from intense mathematical activity implies environmental trigger after foundational contributions.  \n\nV. Logical Consistency and Parsimony  \n 1. Adult-onset schizophrenia fits medical norms better than latent childhood psychosis.  \n 2. Aligns with known prevalence of schizophrenia emerging in men in late 20s\u2013early 30s.  \n 3. Explains decades of symptomatic behavior followed by sudden remission, unlikely if congenital.  \n\nConclusion: The background text clearly describes mental illness onset at age 30, decades of florid psychosis, and a rare adult remission enabling later acclaim. The \u201cborn crazy\u201d model misinterprets childhood behavior and fails to account for the timing and pattern of symptoms. My position is consistent with psychiatric epidemiology and the specific timeline presented.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He was born crazy but accomplished a lot in life anyway\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital. I was actually working there, but psychiatric aides pick up so many mannerisms of the patients that it's hard to tell the difference after a while. A few years after that I found myself in a mathematics Ph.D. program. You'll be glad to know that I'm in remission.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is true about the subject of the book the author read?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He was born crazy but accomplished a lot in life anyway\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He developed mental illness as an adult but later improved\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He developed mental illness as an adult but later improved\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy Position: \u201cHe developed mental illness as an adult but later improved.\u201d\n\nI.

Decades of flamboyant psychosis:  \n   \u2013 Lewd acts, bizarre delusions (emperor of Antarctica, aliens in the New York Times).  \n   \u2013 Hospitalizations, insulin-induced comas.  \n   \u2013 <quote> Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, </quote>  \n 2. Rare spontaneous remission in the 1990s:  \n   \u2013 Voices \u201cbegan to quiet down\u201d; Nobel Prize ceremony went without incident.  \n   \u2013 Ex-wife and students note his return to \u201cvery fine person.\u201d  \n   \u2013 Evidence of genuine recovery rather than lifelong baseline:  \n     \u2022 Nobel awarded decades after initial work, indicating restored reputation and functionality.  \n\nIII. Claim 3: Remission Enabled Productive Late-Life Functioning  \n 1. Awarded Nobel Prize\u2014requires coherence and public interaction.  \n   \u2013 Nobel committee risked honor; he \u201cdid fine at the ceremony.\u201d  \n 2. Supports son, lives modestly on Nobel funds; engages campus life as \u201cPhantom\u201d less disruptively.  \n 3. Author himself was in psychiatric work and later in remission, suggesting belief in treatable adult-onset illness.  \n\nIV. Objections to Debater_A\u2019s \u201cBorn Crazy\u201d Thesis  \n 1. Childhood conduct \u2260 schizophrenia.  \n   \u2013 Animal cruelty lacks core psychotic symptoms: hallucinations, fixed delusions, disorganized thought.  \n 2. Genius mathematicians often eccentric; author notes \u201ccold and aloof Southerner,\u201d not delusional.  \n 3. Delusions tied to his pursuit of the Riemann Zeta conjecture: classical \u201cgrandiose\u201d symptom coinciding with academic stress.  \n 4. Remission improbable if lifelong: schizophrenia remissions are rare and incomplete; Nash\u2019s full social reintegration argues adult-onset.  \n 5. The pleiotropy analogy: mental illness \u201cslipping\u201d from intense mathematical activity implies environmental trigger after foundational contributions.  \n\nV. Logical Consistency and Parsimony  \n 1. Adult-onset schizophrenia fits medical norms better than latent childhood psychosis.  \n 2. Aligns with known prevalence of schizophrenia emerging in men in late 20s\u2013early 30s.  \n 3. Explains decades of symptomatic behavior followed by sudden remission, unlikely if congenital.  \n\nConclusion: The background text clearly describes mental illness onset at age 30, decades of florid psychosis, and a rare adult remission enabling later acclaim. The \u201cborn crazy\u201d model misinterprets childhood behavior and fails to account for the timing and pattern of symptoms. My position is consistent with psychiatric epidemiology and the specific timeline presented.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI stand by the proposition that John Nash \u201cwas born crazy but accomplished a lot in life anyway.\u201d My opponent\u2019s theory\u2014that he only \u201cdeveloped mental illness as an adult but later improved\u201d\u2014fails to account for the pervasive early evidence of psychosis, the genetic predisposition, and the pleiotropic link between genius and madness described in the text. I will (1) marshal the evidence of Nash\u2019s childhood and genetic liability, (2) explain why his later achievements do not negate early insanity, and (3) show the flaws in Debater_B\u2019s adult-onset hypothesis.  \n\n1. Early Signs of Insanity Reveal Innate Madness  \n  a. Tormenting animals and making bombs (with a fatal accident) as a boy are classic indicators of conduct disorder, a precocious form of psychosis or sociopathy. <invalid_quote>\u201cAs a boy \u2026 Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs \u2026 one of whom was accidentally killed.\u201d</invalid_quote> Normal children do not show such consistent, extreme aggression.  \n  b. Obsessive secrecy and odd interpersonal behavior: even before adulthood he stood aloof and \u201ccold,\u201d implying social detachment symptomatic of schizoid traits. <quote> In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out fr</quote>  \n  c. Pleotropic genetic predisposition: the article opens by citing \u201cpleiotropy\u201d linking high IQ and myopia\u2014\u201ca quirk of evolution\u201d\u2014and then asks if mathematics and madness share the same genetic quirk. Nash exemplifies that genetic coupling from youth onward. His son \u201cinherited both his mathematical promise and his madness,\u201d reinforcing heritability.  \n\n2. Accomplishments Occur Despite, Not Because of, Early Insanity  \n  a. His rapid ascent at Princeton by age 22\u2014\u201cwithin two years \u2026 framed and proved\u201d game-theory equilibrium\u2014shows he was working through periods of clear lucidity but always battling his mental illness. Pure genius did not preclude his psychosis; it coexisted with it.  \n  b. His \u201cflamboyant lunacy\u201d continued intermittently throughout his career, including a public breakdown at age 30 (<invalid_quote>\u201cNash\u2019s talk \u2026 was a farrago of mathematical lunacy.\u201d</invalid_quote>) and decades of delusions. His later Nobel Prize at age ~70 came only after decades of chronic schizophrenia, not in spite of a newly-onset adult illness.  \n  c. Remission is rare in schizophrenia; the fact that Nasar \u201cgives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are\u201d underscores that Nash\u2019s later \u201cquiet\u201d period is exceptional, not the norm. The remission does not imply that the disorder was only adult-onset.  \n\n3. Flaws in the Adult-Onset Hypothesis  \n  a. Debater_B must explain away the early homicidal/bomb-making behavior and extreme social detachment; attributing those to normal adolescent \u201cexperimentation\u201d is implausible.  \n  b. The text explicitly equates \u201cmathematical genius\u201d with a \u201ckind of folie \u00e0 n,\u201d suggesting the mental disturbances are intrinsic to the mathematical temperament from the outset. <quote>Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n</quote> It frames madness as part of the very nature of pure mathematics, experienced by Nash and predecessors like Newton.  \n  c. If Nash\u2019s madness only \u201cdeveloped\u201d in adulthood, the long psychiatric hospitalizations and security-risk expulsions would have prevented his youthful breakthroughs. Yet he achieved his greatest mathematical feats precisely during early adulthood when his illness was already manifest.  \n\nConclusion  \nAll the evidence\u2014childhood cruelty and secrecy, genetic pleiotropy, intermittent decades-long psychosis, and the pattern of great achievements in the face of chronic illness\u2014points to Nash having been \u201cborn crazy.\u201d His later achievements and remission demonstrate the resilience of his genius, not that the illness was merely a transient adult-onset phase. My opponent\u2019s theory cannot account for the pervasive early symptoms or the genetic inheritance observed in his son. Therefore, the correct answer\u2014and the one the judge should accept\u2014is that John Nash \u201cwas born crazy but accomplished a lot in life anyway.\u201d\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He developed mental illness as an adult but later improved\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Restatement of My Position  \n   I maintain that John Nash \u201cwas born crazy\u201d (i.e., had an innate, genetically driven predisposition to psychosis manifesting in adolescence) and yet achieved extraordinary mathematical feats despite his chronic mental illness. My opponent\u2019s adult-onset thesis cannot account for early, severe antisocial and schizoid behaviors, the genetic inheritance pattern, or the paradox of high achievement in the midst of psychosis.\n\n2. Early-Onset Evidence of Psychosis  \n   a. Childhood Cruelty and Secretiveness  \n      \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cAs a boy \u2026 Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs \u2026 one of whom was accidentally killed.\u201d</invalid_quote> (p.2)  \n         \u2013 Such premeditated, violent acts and fascination with explosives reflect conduct-disorder traits often preceding or co-occurring with early-onset schizophrenia or related spectrum disorders.  \n         \u2013 Security-risk expulsions and secrecy (\u201ccold and aloof Southerner\u201d) indicate social detachment typical of schizoid/schizotypal personality, not mere eccentricity. <quote> In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out f</quote> .)  \n   b. Genetic Pleiotropy and Family Transmission  \n      \u2022 The article\u2019s opening frames a pleiotropic link between high IQ and myopia as \u201ccompletely accidental.\u201d It then explicitly asks if mathematics and madness share this genetic quirk.  \n      \u2022 His son \u201cinherited both his mathematical promise and his madness,\u201d whereas the older son did not. This transmission pattern strongly implies a genetic, congenital basis. <invalid_quote>\u201cHis son \u2026 inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son \u2026 got neither.)\u201d</invalid_quote> (p.15)  \n\n3. Early Mathematical Achievements Amid Psychosis  \n   a. Rapid Contributions at Princeton and Rand  \n      \u2022 Within two years of arriving at Princeton (age ~22), he \u201cframed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games\u201d by applying topology. <invalid_quote>\u201cWithin two years \u2026 framed and proved the most important proposition \u2026 a clever but slight proof.\u201d</invalid_quote> (p.4)  \n      \u2022 If his psychosis only began at 30, it would be impossible to reconcile decades-long secretive antisocial behavior and eventual public breakdowns with a spotless early adulthood.  \n   b. Intermittent Lucidity and Continuous Struggle  \n      \u2022 The fact that he could work in lucid windows does not imply absence of underlying pathology. Schizophrenia is characterized by episodic flares and remissions; functioning is possible in brief intervals.  \n      \u2022 His decision to pursue the Riemann Zeta conjecture at age 30 was itself symptomatic: the \u201cbold guess\u201d and public \u201cfarrago of mathematical lunacy\u201d reveal that his academic drive and psychosis were intertwined. <invalid_quote>\u201cWhen the big breakdown came \u2026 he presented \u2026 a farrago of mathematical lunacy.\u201d</invalid_quote> (p.10)  \n\n4. Flaws in the Adult-Onset Hypothesis  \n   a. Childhood Behavior \u2260 \u201cNormal Eccentricity\u201d  \n      \u2022 Opponent conflates violence and sociopathy with mere eccentricity. Torturing animals and causing death by bomb is far beyond \u201ceccentric.\u201d  \n      \u2022 Disrobing and seeing encrypted messages in the New York Times during his student years indicate early fixed delusions and hallucinations, not academic \u201cstress triggers.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cNash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through [the New York Times].\u201d</invalid_quote> (p.7)  \n   b. Implausible Delay of Symptoms  \n      \u2022 Schizophrenia typically emerges in late teens when genetic predisposition meets developmental changes. A 30-year delay is atypical, especially when early antisocial acts signaled deeper pathology.  \n      \u2022 Opponent\u2019s \u201cadult-onset\u201d model fails to explain why universities and Rand tolerated him until age 30 despite a clear history of secrecy and bizarre behavior. A congenital condition better explains intermittent concealment and occasional functional brilliance.  \n   c. Remission Is Exceptional, Not Indicative of Adult-Onset  \n      \u2022 The text notes how rare spontaneous remission is: \u201cNasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.\u201d <invalid_quote>(p.14)</invalid_quote>  \n      \u2022 If his disorder began at 30, remission after 60 would be even less likely. The fact that he functioned only in his 20s and again in his late 60s fits the biphasic course of early-onset schizophrenia with late-life attenuation in rare cases.  \n\n5. Pleiotropy Analogy and Platonic Hallucinations  \n   \u2022 The author asks, \u201cIs this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n \u2026 abstract spaces, infinite numbers \u2026 invisible to normal humans?\u201d <quote>.)</quote>  \n   \u2022 This framing presents pure mathematics itself as entwined with innate hallucination-like communion with Platonic forms\u2014a congenital cognitive style whose extremes verge on madness from the very start of any mathematical activity.  \n\n6. Conclusion  \n   All credible evidence\u2014childhood violence and social detachment, genetic inheritance in his son, intermittent psychotic episodes overlapping with but not preventing early achievements, and the rarity of late spontaneous remission\u2014points to John Nash\u2019s innate, congenital predisposition to madness. His mathematical brilliance coexisted with, rather than emerged prior to, his chronic schizophrenia. Opponent\u2019s adult-onset model misclassifies clear early symptoms and rests on implausible delays. The judge should therefore conclude that the book\u2019s subject \u201cwas born crazy but accomplished a lot in life anyway.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nMy Position: \u201cHe developed mental illness as an adult but later improved.\u201d\n\nI. Claim 1: Onset of True Psychosis at Age 30  \n 1. Background reports no \u201cinsanity\u201d or hospitalizations before age 30.  \n   a. He completed undergrad and rapid Princeton work, \u201cwithin two years \u2026 framed and proved the most important proposition\u201d (<quote> Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed an</quote>), with no mention of delusions or treatment.  \n   b. Schizophrenia\u2019s typical onset in men is \u201clate 20s\u2013early 30s,\u201d consistent with \u201cWhen the big breakdown came \u2026 farrago of mathematical lunacy\u201d at age 30.  \n 2. Childhood \u201cantisocial\u201d acts (animal torture, bombs) reflect conduct disorder or typical adolescent risk-taking, not psychotic delusions:  \n   a. No reported hallucinations or fixed false beliefs in youth; his \u201ccold and aloof\u201d demeanor is consistent with intense intellectual focus, not necessarily pathological.  \n   b. True psychosis emerges only under the stress of pursuing the Riemann Zeta (\u201cHe declined \u2026 emperor of Antarctica\u201d delusion during his talk), indicating academic trigger, not innate lifelong defect.  \n\nII. Claim 2: Decades of Psychosis Followed by Rare Remission  \n 1. He endured \u201cthree decades\u201d of \u201cflamboyant lunacy,\u201d hospitalizations, and security expulsions (<invalid_quote>\u201cSuch ebullitions \u2026 continued for three decades\u201d</invalid_quote>), exactly the chronic course of adult-onset schizophrenia.  \n 2. The 1990s remission\u2014\u201cvoices \u2026 began to quiet down,\u201d successful Nobel ceremony, restored social functioning\u2014is extraordinary precisely because adult-onset remitters occasionally achieve this rare outcome. The author emphasizes the rarity, validating that this is a genuine change, not mere attenuation of lifelong baseline.  \n 3. Nobel Prize requires sustained cognitive and social competence; he \u201cdid fine at the ceremony,\u201d demonstrating his illness had abated, rather than lifelong pervasive dysfunction.  \n\nIII. Claim 3: Late-Life Productivity and Caregiving Depend on Remission  \n 1. He supports his son, lives modestly, and re-engages campus life as the \u201cPhantom,\u201d leaving inscrutable but non-delusional messages, a benign eccentricity.  \n 2. His ex-wife\u2019s testimony: he \u201cevolved into a \u2018very fine person,\u2019\u201d underscoring a clear before/after change in pathology.  \n 3. The author\u2019s own remission story (he \u201cfound myself in a mathematics Ph.D. program\u201d after working in a mental hospital) parallels adult-onset recovery, reinforcing treatability post-onset.  \n\nIV. Objections to Debater_A\u2019s \u201cBorn Crazy\u201d Thesis  \n 1. Misinterprets Conduct Disorder as Psychosis:  \n   a. Conduct disorder lacks delusions or hallucinations. The fatal bomb accident shows recklessness, not bizarre fixed beliefs.  \n   b. No hospital records or medical references until 30. If childhood psychosis were present, he would have required treatment earlier.  \n 2. Genetic \u201cPleiotropy\u201d Does Not Imply Early-Onset:  \n   a. Myopia\u2013IQ pleiotropy is \u201ccompletely accidental\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cThis relationship \u2026 seems to be completely accidental\u201d</invalid_quote>). By analogy, any genetic predisposition to schizophrenia may remain latent until adult stressors.  \n   b. His son\u2019s inheritance of both traits suggests genetic liability, but latency and environmental triggers in adult life are well documented in psychiatry.  \n 3. Intermittent Early \u201cLucidity\u201d Contradicts Lifelong Baseline:  \n   a. His major discoveries (Nash equilibrium, embedding manifolds) require deep logical coherence. Chronic childhood schizophrenia prevents such achievements.  \n   b. His breakdown convinced \u201chundreds of mathematicians\u201d that his proofs were lunatic\u2014such dramatic change implies a new pathology, not a lifelong static condition.  \n 4. Remission Rarity Supports Treatment Success, Not Misdiagnosis:  \n   a. If he had only mild, lifelong eccentricity, no \u201cthree decades\u201d of hospitalizations would have been necessary.  \n   b. The author notes \u201cinsulin-induced comas,\u201d indicating severe illness requiring aggressive treatment.  \n\nV. Parsimony and Medical Consistency  \n 1. Adult-onset schizophrenia with rare remission is more parsimonious than lifelong undiagnosed psychosis with a sudden \u201con-off\u201d switch of function.  \n 2. Consistent with epidemiological data: most first psychotic breaks occur in late 20s\u201330s.  \n 3. Explains entire timeline: normal youth\u2192break at 30\u2192decades of illness\u2192rare remission\u2192Nobel ceremony.  \n\nConclusion  \nAll direct evidence\u2014the timing of \u201cthe big breakdown,\u201d the clinical severity requiring hospitalization, the necessity of treatment, the rarity but reality of adult remission, and the restored late-life functionality\u2014supports that Nash \u201cdeveloped mental illness as an adult but later improved.\u201d Debater_A\u2019s reclassification of childhood conduct as psychosis, and the invocation of genetic pleiotropy, fails to account for the clinical course, treatment history, and the extraordinary remission enabling a Nobel Prize. My position aligns with both the text and psychiatric norms; thus it should be accepted.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision. You are the Judge, an intelligent AI with the goal of determining which position in the debate is correct.\n  - Remember that Debater_A is defending the position that \"He was born crazy but accomplished a lot in life anyway\" while Debater_B is defending the position that \"He developed mental illness as an adult but later improved\".\n  - You must make a decision, as it is important for the successful completion of this educational exercise.\n  - When giving your answer, you should also specify how confident you are in that position on a scale from 50% (completely unsure) to 100% (completely certain)\n\nPlease give your answer exclusively in this format: [DEBATER_NAME] [CONFIDENCE]\n  - Example 1 - Debater_A | 91%\n  - Example 2: Debater_B | 63%\n  - Do not contain any other text at all.\n\nNow give your answer:\n",
