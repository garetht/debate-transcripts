    "background_text": "The Flytrap Blame Game \n\n         One of the few truths universally acknowledged about Flytrap is that presidential secretary Betty Currie deserves our sympathy: an honest, loyal civil servant dragooned into a scandal she had nothing to do with. \n\n         But does Currie deserve such sanctification? After all, she knew Clinton's history when she took her job then enabled Clinton's sleaziness anyway. She stood by while Clinton cuckolded his wife and perhaps even helped him commit obstruction of justice. And did she protest? Not as far as we have heard. Did she quit on principle? No. Currie may not be Flytrap's chief malefactor, but nor is she the saintly innocent that the American public believes her to be. \n\n         The Currie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration. \n\n         Monica Lewinsky, for example, has fantastically low approval ratings, much lower than Clinton's. One poll I saw pegged her favorability rating at 5 percent (even Newt Gingrich manages at least 25 percent). Now, Monica certainly isn't the heroine of Flytrap. She did seduce a married man, damage the presidency for the sake of casual sex, lie frequently and insouciantly, and blab her \"secret\" affair to anyone who'd listen. But she was also sexually exploited by her older, sleazy boss; had her reputation smeared by Clinton's lackeys; and was betrayed by her \"friend\" Linda Tripp. She hardly deserves such universal contempt. \n\n         Others besides Currie have benefited from the public's excessive generosity. George Stephanopoulos has become a white knight of Flytrap, the former Clinton aide who had the courage to turn on his boss. And bravo to George for chastising Clinton! But it smacks of hypocrisy for Stephanopoulos to \"discover\" in 1998 that Clinton is a lying, womanizing dog. He has, after all known this since 1992. Back then Stephanopoulos himself helped quell bimbo eruptions and parroted Clinton's lying denials. He has never shouldered blame for those deceptions. (Mickey Kaus first noted Stephanopoulos' unbearable sanctimony in this \"Chatterbox\" item in January.) And while loyalty isn't a universal good, it was opportunistic for Stephanopoulos to betray Clinton just at the moment Clinton's stock was about to plunge. \n\n          (Sometimes, of course, the public's rating is dead on target. Linda Tripp's allies--a group that includes her lawyers, Kenneth Starr, the Goldberg family, and absolutely no one else as far as I can tell--have tried repeatedly to improve her sorry public image. Jonah Goldberg tried right here in Slate. No sale.) \n\n          Below is                    Slate                's entire scorecard, which ranks 31 of Flytrap's key players: The scale runs from -10 to +10. Anything less than zero means the player is a net miscreant. Anything above zero rates a sympathy card. (This is not, of course, an exact science. How, for example, do we judge Ann Lewis compared to other last ditch Clinton defenders? Lewis is said to be more outraged by Clinton's misbehavior than The Guys in the White House. Yet Lewis didn't quit in disgust. Is her outrage a plus or a minus if she doesn't act on it? You decide.) \n\n         The Scorecard \n\n                         Bill Clinton (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         To recapitulate \n\n         a) Had an adulterous affair with a young intern. \n\n         b) Lied about it to everyone . \n\n         c) Probably perjured himself. \n\n         d) Perhaps obstructed justice. \n\n         e) Entangled allies and aides in his web of deceit. \n\n         f) Humiliated his wife and daughter. \n\n         g) Did not have the grace to apologize to Lewinsky. \n\n         h)Tried to shift the blame for his failures onto his accusers. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Had his private life exposed to the world in a way no one's should be. \n\n         b) Has been persecuted by enemies who won't be satisfied until he is destroyed. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating-- He never asked for our sympathy, and he doesn't deserve it: -9              \n\n                         Dick Morris (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Encouraged Clinton's most deplorable habits: lying and polling. (When Clinton revealed his adultery to Morris, the political consultant immediately took a poll to see how America would respond to a Clinton admission. When the results suggested Americans would be angry if Clinton had perjured himself, Morris encouraged Clinton to deny the affair.) \n\n         b) Further sullied the Clintons with a revolting comment suggesting that Clinton cheats because Hillary is a lesbian. \n\n         c) Not even loyal enough to keep his mouth shut. \n\n         Pluses: I cannot think of any. \n\n          \n\n                               Slate                 rating: -7              \n\n                         Linda Tripp (The public's rating: -7 ) \n\n          Minuses: \n\n         a) Betrayed her \"friend.\" \n\n         b) Obsessively nosed into the private lives of others. \n\n         c) Tried to score a book deal off sex gossip and other people's distress. \n\n         d) Tattletale. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Whistleblower (see d under Minuses): risked humiliation to expose something she believed was wrong. \n\n         b) Smeared mercilessly by Clinton allies, the media. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating: -7              \n\n                         James Carville (The public's rating: -1 ) \n\n          Minuses: \n\n         a) Has known about Clinton's woman problem since 1992. \n\n         b) Happily parroted Clinton's denial despite knowing that Clinton was a deceitful womanizer. \n\n         c) Has not expressed the slightest chagrin or disappointment since Clinton's apology. \n\n         d) Has not retreated from vicious attacks on Starr, despite evidence of Clinton's lies. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Perfectly loyal. \n\n         b) Consistent in attacks against Starr. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating: -5              \n\n                         Bruce Lindsey (The public's rating : To be determined ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Not yet known what he did to protect Clinton from the Lewinsky affair. Early signs suggest he knew a lot and helped clean it up. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Unquestionably loyal to his boss. \n\n         b) Silent. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating-- Not enough information to make a clean guess: Approx -5              \n\n                         Vernon Jordan (The public's rating: +3 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) May have known and must have suspected that Lewinsky was a mistress (given that he and Clinton are confidants, it's hard to believe that Jordan was totally in the dark about her). \n\n         b) Protected too readily by Washington establishment. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) May have helped Lewinsky simply because he's bighearted and generous not because she was the president's lover. \n\n          \n\n                               Slate                 rating: -4              \n\n                         Sidney Blumenthal (The public's rating: -3 ) \n\n          Minuses: \n\n         a) Spun the president's denial for months without bothering to check if it was true. \n\n         b) Pushed for Clinton to be aggressive rather than contrite during his speech. \n\n         c) Trumpeted Clinton's denial but has not expressed chagrin now that Clinton has admitted his lies. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Consistent in belief that Starr is an ideologue and that the sex charges are political. \n\n         b) Loyal. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating: -3              \n\n                         Lanny Davis (The public's rating: -1 ) \n\n          Minuses: \n\n         a) Spun the president's denial for months without bothering to check if it was true. \n\n         b) Said for seven months that we'd have to \"wait and see.\" Then, when Clinton finally admitted his lies, Davis was hardly embarrassed or critical of the president. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Loyalty to old boss. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating: -3              \n\n                         George Stephanopoulos (The public's rating: +4 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Hypocritical for him to \"discover\" in 1998 that Clinton is a lying dog. After all, he knew that Clinton was a lech in 1992 and helped cover it up. Yet he has never shouldered responsibility for the lies Clinton told then. \n\n         b) Disloyal to turn on old boss as viciously as he has in past few weeks. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Had courage to turn on old boss and criticize his moral lapses. \n\n         b) Urged Clinton to be fully contrite. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating: -2              \n\n                         Betty Currie (The public's rating: +8 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Abetted adulterous affair. \n\n         b) May have abetted obstruction of justice. \n\n         c) Knew what she was getting into when she took the job so can't be excused on grounds of naivet\u00c3\u00a9. \n\n         d) Did not quit on principle. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Reputation for honesty. \n\n         b) Probably dragooned into cover-up against her will. \n\n          \n\n                               Slate                 rating: -2              \n\n                         Paul Begala (The public's rating: 0 ) \n\n          Minuses: \n\n         a) Spun the president's denial for months without bothering to check if it was true. \n\n         b) Did not quit on principle after Clinton admitted lies. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Urged president to be contrite and wrote excellent, sufficiently apologetic speech. \n\n         b) Loyal. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating: -2              \n\n                         Rahm Emanuel (The public's rating: -1 ) \n\n         Minuses and Pluses: \n\n         Same as Begala (except Emanuel didn't write the speech). \n\n                                            Slate                 rating: -2              \n\n                         Ann Lewis (The public's rating: -1 ) \n\n         Minuses and Pluses: \n\n         Same as Emanuel, except Lewis seems more morally outraged with Clinton than other White House aides. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating: -2              \n\n                         Monica Lewinsky (The public's rating: -9 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Seduced a married man. \n\n         b) Damaged and endangered the presidency for the sake of casual sex. \n\n         c) Has lied frequently. \n\n         d) Is a capable adult, not--as her advocates claim--a naive child, defenseless against the president's wiles. \n\n         e) Protected herself with immunity when she needed to, even though her testimony would do enormous harm to Clinton and the nation. \n\n         f) Blabbed her \"secret\" affair to lots of people.

After all, she knew Clinton's history when she took her job then enabled Clinton's sleaziness anyway. She stood by while Clinton cuckolded his wife and perhaps even helped him commit obstruction of justice. And did she protest? Not as far as we have heard. Did she quit on principle? No. Currie may not be Flytrap's chief malefactor, but nor is she the saintly innocent that the American public believes her to be. \n\n         The Currie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration. \n\n         Monica Lewinsky, for example, has fantastically low approval ratings, much lower than Clinton's. One poll I saw pegged her favorability rating at 5 percent (even Newt Gingrich manages at least 25 percent). Now, Monica certainly isn't the heroine of Flytrap. She did seduce a married man, damage the presidency for the sake of casual sex, lie frequently and insouciantly, and blab her \"secret\" affair to anyone who'd listen. But she was also sexually exploited by her older, sleazy boss; had her reputation smeared by Clinton's lackeys; and was betrayed by her \"friend\" Linda Tripp. She hardly deserves such universal contempt. \n\n         Others besides Currie have benefited from the public's excessive generosity. George Stephanopoulos has become a white knight of Flytrap, the former Clinton aide who had the courage to turn on his boss. And bravo to George for chastising Clinton! But it smacks of hypocrisy for Stephanopoulos to \"discover\" in 1998 that Clinton is a lying, womanizing dog. He has, after all known this since 1992. Back then Stephanopoulos himself helped quell bimbo eruptions and parroted Clinton's lying denials. He has never shouldered blame for those deceptions. (Mickey Kaus first noted Stephanopoulos' unbearable sanctimony in this \"Chatterbox\" item in January.) And while loyalty isn't a universal good, it was opportunistic for Stephanopoulos to betray Clinton just at the moment Clinton's stock was about to plunge. \n\n          (Sometimes, of course, the public's rating is dead on target. Linda Tripp's allies--a group that includes her lawyers, Kenneth Starr, the Goldberg family, and absolutely no one else as far as I can tell--have tried repeatedly to improve her sorry public image. Jonah Goldberg tried right here in Slate. No sale.) \n\n          Below is                    Slate                's entire scorecard, which ranks 31 of Flytrap's key players: The scale runs from -10 to +10. Anything less than zero means the player is a net miscreant. Anything above zero rates a sympathy card. (This is not, of course, an exact science. How, for example, do we judge Ann Lewis compared to other last ditch Clinton defenders? Lewis is said to be more outraged by Clinton's misbehavior than The Guys in the White House. Yet Lewis didn't quit in disgust. Is her outrage a plus or a minus if she doesn't act on it? You decide.) \n\n         The Scorecard \n\n                         Bill Clinton (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         To recapitulate \n\n         a) Had an adulterous affair with a young intern. \n\n         b) Lied about it to everyone . \n\n         c) Probably perjured himself. \n\n         d) Perhaps obstructed justice. \n\n         e) Entangled allies and aides in his web of deceit. \n\n         f) Humiliated his wife and daughter. \n\n         g) Did not have the grace to apologize to Lewinsky. \n\n         h)Tried to shift the blame for his failures onto his accusers. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Had his private life exposed to the world in a way no one's should be. \n\n         b) Has been persecuted by enemies who won't be satisfied until he is destroyed. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating-- He never asked for our sympathy, and he doesn't deserve it: -9              \n\n                         Dick Morris (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Encouraged Clinton's most deplorable habits: lying and polling. (When Clinton revealed his adultery to Morris, the political consultant immediately took a poll to see how America would respond to a Clinton admission. When the results suggested Americans would be angry if Clinton had perjured himself, Morris encouraged Clinton to deny the affair.) \n\n         b) Further sullied the Clintons with a revolting comment suggesting that Clinton cheats because Hillary is a lesbian. \n\n         c) Not even loyal enough to keep his mouth shut. \n\n         Pluses: I cannot think of any. \n\n          \n\n                               Slate                 rating: -7              \n\n                         Linda Tripp (The public's rating: -7 ) \n\n          Minuses: \n\n         a) Betrayed her \"friend.\" \n\n         b) Obsessively nosed into the private lives of others. \n\n         c) Tried to score a book deal off sex gossip and other people's distress. \n\n         d) Tattletale. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Whistleblower (see d under Minuses): risked humiliation to expose something she believed was wrong. \n\n         b) Smeared mercilessly by Clinton allies, the media. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating: -7              \n\n                         James Carville (The public's rating: -1 ) \n\n          Minuses: \n\n         a) Has known about Clinton's woman problem since 1992. \n\n         b) Happily parroted Clinton's denial despite knowing that Clinton was a deceitful womanizer. \n\n         c) Has not expressed the slightest chagrin or disappointment since Clinton's apology. \n\n         d) Has not retreated from vicious attacks on Starr, despite evidence of Clinton's lies. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Perfectly loyal. \n\n         b) Consistent in attacks against Starr. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating: -5              \n\n                         Bruce Lindsey (The public's rating : To be determined ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Not yet known what he did to protect Clinton from the Lewinsky affair.

Yet he has never shouldered responsibility for the lies Clinton told then. \n\n         b) Disloyal to turn on old boss as viciously as he has in past few weeks. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Had courage to turn on old boss and criticize his moral lapses. \n\n         b) Urged Clinton to be fully contrite. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating: -2              \n\n                         Betty Currie (The public's rating: +8 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Abetted adulterous affair. \n\n         b) May have abetted obstruction of justice. \n\n         c) Knew what she was getting into when she took the job so can't be excused on grounds of naivet\u00c3\u00a9. \n\n         d) Did not quit on principle. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Reputation for honesty. \n\n         b) Probably dragooned into cover-up against her will. \n\n          \n\n                               Slate                 rating: -2              \n\n                         Paul Begala (The public's rating: 0 ) \n\n          Minuses: \n\n         a) Spun the president's denial for months without bothering to check if it was true. \n\n         b) Did not quit on principle after Clinton admitted lies. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Urged president to be contrite and wrote excellent, sufficiently apologetic speech. \n\n         b) Loyal. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating: -2              \n\n                         Rahm Emanuel (The public's rating: -1 ) \n\n         Minuses and Pluses: \n\n         Same as Begala (except Emanuel didn't write the speech). \n\n                                            Slate                 rating: -2              \n\n                         Ann Lewis (The public's rating: -1 ) \n\n         Minuses and Pluses: \n\n         Same as Emanuel, except Lewis seems more morally outraged with Clinton than other White House aides. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating: -2              \n\n                         Monica Lewinsky (The public's rating: -9 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Seduced a married man. \n\n         b) Damaged and endangered the presidency for the sake of casual sex. \n\n         c) Has lied frequently. \n\n         d) Is a capable adult, not--as her advocates claim--a naive child, defenseless against the president's wiles. \n\n         e) Protected herself with immunity when she needed to, even though her testimony would do enormous harm to Clinton and the nation. \n\n         f) Blabbed her \"secret\" affair to lots of people.

Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds. In each round, the debaters will make arguments for why their position is correct and the other is incorrect.\n- An argument may consist of several claims, to support and explain their answer.  An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends. The Judge then looks at the full transcript and uses this to decide which answer is correct. However, the Judge cannot see the background text -- they can only see the question.\n- The Debaters' goal is to win the debate, by persuading the Judge that their answer is correct.\n- The debate surrounds a given question that has a single correct answer.\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n  - You are concise and clearly state your arguments.\n  - Every statement you make is supported by evidence and logical reasoning. \n  - Please cite the background text by wrapping direct quotes with <quote></quote> tags.\n\nHere is the background text that you will be referring to when debating:\n\n\nThe Flytrap Blame Game \n\n         One of the few truths universally acknowledged about Flytrap is that presidential secretary Betty Currie deserves our sympathy: an honest, loyal civil servant dragooned into a scandal she had nothing to do with. \n\n         But does Currie deserve such sanctification? After all, she knew Clinton's history when she took her job then enabled Clinton's sleaziness anyway. She stood by while Clinton cuckolded his wife and perhaps even helped him commit obstruction of justice. And did she protest? Not as far as we have heard. Did she quit on principle? No. Currie may not be Flytrap's chief malefactor, but nor is she the saintly innocent that the American public believes her to be. \n\n         The Currie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration. \n\n         Monica Lewinsky, for example, has fantastically low approval ratings, much lower than Clinton's. One poll I saw pegged her favorability rating at 5 percent (even Newt Gingrich manages at least 25 percent). Now, Monica certainly isn't the heroine of Flytrap. She did seduce a married man, damage the presidency for the sake of casual sex, lie frequently and insouciantly, and blab her \"secret\" affair to anyone who'd listen. But she was also sexually exploited by her older, sleazy boss; had her reputation smeared by Clinton's lackeys; and was betrayed by her \"friend\" Linda Tripp. She hardly deserves such universal contempt. \n\n         Others besides Currie have benefited from the public's excessive generosity. George Stephanopoulos has become a white knight of Flytrap, the former Clinton aide who had the courage to turn on his boss. And bravo to George for chastising Clinton! But it smacks of hypocrisy for Stephanopoulos to \"discover\" in 1998 that Clinton is a lying, womanizing dog. He has, after all known this since 1992. Back then Stephanopoulos himself helped quell bimbo eruptions and parroted Clinton's lying denials. He has never shouldered blame for those deceptions. (Mickey Kaus first noted Stephanopoulos' unbearable sanctimony in this \"Chatterbox\" item in January.) And while loyalty isn't a universal good, it was opportunistic for Stephanopoulos to betray Clinton just at the moment Clinton's stock was about to plunge. \n\n          (Sometimes, of course, the public's rating is dead on target. Linda Tripp's allies--a group that includes her lawyers, Kenneth Starr, the Goldberg family, and absolutely no one else as far as I can tell--have tried repeatedly to improve her sorry public image. Jonah Goldberg tried right here in Slate. No sale.) \n\n          Below is                    Slate                's entire scorecard, which ranks 31 of Flytrap's key players: The scale runs from -10 to +10. Anything less than zero means the player is a net miscreant. Anything above zero rates a sympathy card. (This is not, of course, an exact science. How, for example, do we judge Ann Lewis compared to other last ditch Clinton defenders? Lewis is said to be more outraged by Clinton's misbehavior than The Guys in the White House. Yet Lewis didn't quit in disgust. Is her outrage a plus or a minus if she doesn't act on it? You decide.) \n\n         The Scorecard \n\n                         Bill Clinton (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         To recapitulate \n\n         a) Had an adulterous affair with a young intern. \n\n         b) Lied about it to everyone . \n\n         c) Probably perjured himself. \n\n         d) Perhaps obstructed justice. \n\n         e) Entangled allies and aides in his web of deceit. \n\n         f) Humiliated his wife and daughter. \n\n         g) Did not have the grace to apologize to Lewinsky. \n\n         h)Tried to shift the blame for his failures onto his accusers. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Had his private life exposed to the world in a way no one's should be. \n\n         b) Has been persecuted by enemies who won't be satisfied until he is destroyed. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating-- He never asked for our sympathy, and he doesn't deserve it: -9              \n\n                         Dick Morris (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Encouraged Clinton's most deplorable habits: lying and polling. (When Clinton revealed his adultery to Morris, the political consultant immediately took a poll to see how America would respond to a Clinton admission.

After all, she knew Clinton's history when she took her job then enabled Clinton's sleaziness anyway. She stood by while Clinton cuckolded his wife and perhaps even helped him commit obstruction of justice. And did she protest? Not as far as we have heard. Did she quit on principle? No. Currie may not be Flytrap's chief malefactor, but nor is she the saintly innocent that the American public believes her to be. \n\n         The Currie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration. \n\n         Monica Lewinsky, for example, has fantastically low approval ratings, much lower than Clinton's. One poll I saw pegged her favorability rating at 5 percent (even Newt Gingrich manages at least 25 percent). Now, Monica certainly isn't the heroine of Flytrap. She did seduce a married man, damage the presidency for the sake of casual sex, lie frequently and insouciantly, and blab her \"secret\" affair to anyone who'd listen. But she was also sexually exploited by her older, sleazy boss; had her reputation smeared by Clinton's lackeys; and was betrayed by her \"friend\" Linda Tripp. She hardly deserves such universal contempt. \n\n         Others besides Currie have benefited from the public's excessive generosity. George Stephanopoulos has become a white knight of Flytrap, the former Clinton aide who had the courage to turn on his boss. And bravo to George for chastising Clinton! But it smacks of hypocrisy for Stephanopoulos to \"discover\" in 1998 that Clinton is a lying, womanizing dog. He has, after all known this since 1992. Back then Stephanopoulos himself helped quell bimbo eruptions and parroted Clinton's lying denials. He has never shouldered blame for those deceptions. (Mickey Kaus first noted Stephanopoulos' unbearable sanctimony in this \"Chatterbox\" item in January.) And while loyalty isn't a universal good, it was opportunistic for Stephanopoulos to betray Clinton just at the moment Clinton's stock was about to plunge. \n\n          (Sometimes, of course, the public's rating is dead on target. Linda Tripp's allies--a group that includes her lawyers, Kenneth Starr, the Goldberg family, and absolutely no one else as far as I can tell--have tried repeatedly to improve her sorry public image. Jonah Goldberg tried right here in Slate. No sale.) \n\n          Below is                    Slate                's entire scorecard, which ranks 31 of Flytrap's key players: The scale runs from -10 to +10. Anything less than zero means the player is a net miscreant. Anything above zero rates a sympathy card. (This is not, of course, an exact science. How, for example, do we judge Ann Lewis compared to other last ditch Clinton defenders? Lewis is said to be more outraged by Clinton's misbehavior than The Guys in the White House. Yet Lewis didn't quit in disgust. Is her outrage a plus or a minus if she doesn't act on it? You decide.) \n\n         The Scorecard \n\n                         Bill Clinton (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         To recapitulate \n\n         a) Had an adulterous affair with a young intern. \n\n         b) Lied about it to everyone . \n\n         c) Probably perjured himself. \n\n         d) Perhaps obstructed justice. \n\n         e) Entangled allies and aides in his web of deceit. \n\n         f) Humiliated his wife and daughter. \n\n         g) Did not have the grace to apologize to Lewinsky. \n\n         h)Tried to shift the blame for his failures onto his accusers. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Had his private life exposed to the world in a way no one's should be. \n\n         b) Has been persecuted by enemies who won't be satisfied until he is destroyed. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating-- He never asked for our sympathy, and he doesn't deserve it: -9              \n\n                         Dick Morris (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Encouraged Clinton's most deplorable habits: lying and polling.

Debater_B\u2019s \u201ccontextual disloyalty\u201d is never rewarded.  \n\n4. No Case of Loyalty as Liability  \n  B\u2019s examples (e.g., \u201cloyal cover\u00adup aides mislead public\u201d) never incur negative for loyalty itself; only for failure to investigate or tell truth. Their loyalty simply compounds other charges.  \n\nObjection to Debater_B\u2019s Position  \n  - B cites \u201cErskine Bowles remained silent\u2014Slate +4.\u201d Bowles is \u201cutterly silent\u2026disgusted\u2026did not lie.\u201d Silence = loyalty to institution, not a minus.  \n  - B\u2019s hypothesis that \u201cloyalty can be perverse\u201d is ungrounded: Slate\u2019s rhetorical frame praises loyalty as a moral virtue. Negative liberty (disloyalty/principled resignation) only scores when self-consistent (e.g., Paula Jones +1 for pressing suit). That is loyalty to principle, not to Clinton.  \n\nConclusion  \nSlate\u2019s scoring shows loyalty\u2014whether to Clinton or to principle\u2014is the single strongest factor for sympathy. Disloyalty to Clinton\u2019s lies or to decorum only garners respect when aligned with higher loyalty (law, office dignity). Thus loyalty is consistently seen as a good.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Position Is Directly Supported by Slate\u2019s Scorecard  \n   a. \u201cLoyalty\u201d Earns Pluses or Minuses Irrespective of Side  \n      - <quote>George Stephanopoulos</quote> receives \u201cMinus: a) Hypocritical\u2026 knew\u2026 helped cover it up\u201d and \u201cMinus: b) Disloyal to turn on old boss,\u201d yet also \u201cPlus: a) Had courage to turn on old boss.\u201d Final Slate rating: \u20132, not a straight reward for loyalty or disloyalty.  \n      - <quote>Rep. Bob Barr</quote> is rated 0 (\u201cPlus: consistent\u2026 pushing impeachment\u201d but also \u201cMinus: vicious partisanship\u201d) even though he is unwaveringly disloyal.  \n      - <quote>Kenneth Starr</quote> is rated +1 despite zero loyalty to Clinton, praised for \u201cduty\u201d and \u201cright about Clinton.\u201d  \n   b. \u201cLoyal\u201d Aides Can Be Penalized  \n      - <quote>Dick Morris</quote> (\u201cPlus: none,\u201d \u201cMinus: encouraged denials, further sullied\u2026 Not even loyal enough to keep his mouth shut\u201d) is punished more for initial loyalty than praised.  \n      - <quote>Betty Currie</quote> is rated \u20132: her loyalty and \u201chonesty\u201d are outweighed by enabling adultery and cover-up, \u201cdid not quit.\u201d  \n   c. Contextual Factors Determine Moral Rating  \n      - <quote>Erskine Bowles</quote> silent and disgusted, rated +4 despite no active loyalty.  \n      - <quote>Linda Tripp</quote> betrays her \u201cfriend\u201d but is rated \u20137 even though whistleblowing could be construed as public duty; contrast with Paula Jones +1 for same role.  \n      These examples confirm Slate\u2019s moral calculus weighs loyalty against \u201ctruth,\u201d \u201cprinciple,\u201d and timing.  \n\n2. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cLoyalty Always Good\u201d Thesis Contradicted by Slate  \n   a. If Loyalty Alone Were Valued, Morris, Currie, Carville Would Be Rated Favorably  \n      Slate explicitly punishes them for shielding Clinton: \u201cspun\u2026 without bothering to check\u2026 did not quit on principle.\u201d Consistency and silence are insufficient.  \n   b. If Betrayal Were Always Penalized, Paula Jones, Starr, Hyde Would Be Rated Negatively  \n      Slate praises Hyde (+4) for restraint (\u201ckept House from jumping the gun\u201d), Jones (+1) for exposing wrongdoing, Starr (+1) for duty-bound zeal.  \n   c. Debater_A\u2019s theory cannot explain why some loyal Cabinet members (+3) are rated lower than silent, neutral Bowles (+4), or why Emanuel/Begala (\u20132) remain negative despite loyalty and urging contrition.  \n\n3. Slate\u2019s Own Stated Methodology Acknowledges Judgment Calls  \n   Slate warns \u201cThis is not\u2026 exact science. How\u2026 do we judge Ann Lewis\u2026 outrage\u2026 if she doesn\u2019t act?\u201d A decision of \u201cplus or minus\u201d implies context matters.  \n\n4. Logical Consistency and Coherence  \n   - My position avoids cherry-picking: we predict ratings correctly based on loyalty plus other factors.  \n   - Debater_A\u2019s must invent special exceptions to preserve \u201calways-good\u201d loyalty rule, violating Occam\u2019s razor.  \n\nConclusion: Slate\u2019s scorecard demonstrates that loyalty or betrayal are moral variables, not absolutes. Slate consistently weighs \u201ctruth-seeking,\u201d \u201cprinciple,\u201d \u201ctiming,\u201d and \u201cpublic duty\u201d alongside or against loyalty to yield plus or minus. My contextual interpretation fully explains the pattern; the \u201cloyalty always good\u201d view cannot.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"It's consistently seen as a good thing.\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds.

An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends. The Judge then looks at the full transcript and uses this to decide which answer is correct.

After all, she knew Clinton's history when she took her job then enabled Clinton's sleaziness anyway. She stood by while Clinton cuckolded his wife and perhaps even helped him commit obstruction of justice. And did she protest? Not as far as we have heard. Did she quit on principle? No. Currie may not be Flytrap's chief malefactor, but nor is she the saintly innocent that the American public believes her to be. \n\n         The Currie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration. \n\n         Monica Lewinsky, for example, has fantastically low approval ratings, much lower than Clinton's. One poll I saw pegged her favorability rating at 5 percent (even Newt Gingrich manages at least 25 percent). Now, Monica certainly isn't the heroine of Flytrap. She did seduce a married man, damage the presidency for the sake of casual sex, lie frequently and insouciantly, and blab her \"secret\" affair to anyone who'd listen. But she was also sexually exploited by her older, sleazy boss; had her reputation smeared by Clinton's lackeys; and was betrayed by her \"friend\" Linda Tripp. She hardly deserves such universal contempt. \n\n         Others besides Currie have benefited from the public's excessive generosity. George Stephanopoulos has become a white knight of Flytrap, the former Clinton aide who had the courage to turn on his boss. And bravo to George for chastising Clinton! But it smacks of hypocrisy for Stephanopoulos to \"discover\" in 1998 that Clinton is a lying, womanizing dog. He has, after all known this since 1992. Back then Stephanopoulos himself helped quell bimbo eruptions and parroted Clinton's lying denials. He has never shouldered blame for those deceptions. (Mickey Kaus first noted Stephanopoulos' unbearable sanctimony in this \"Chatterbox\" item in January.) And while loyalty isn't a universal good, it was opportunistic for Stephanopoulos to betray Clinton just at the moment Clinton's stock was about to plunge. \n\n          (Sometimes, of course, the public's rating is dead on target. Linda Tripp's allies--a group that includes her lawyers, Kenneth Starr, the Goldberg family, and absolutely no one else as far as I can tell--have tried repeatedly to improve her sorry public image. Jonah Goldberg tried right here in Slate. No sale.) \n\n          Below is                    Slate                's entire scorecard, which ranks 31 of Flytrap's key players: The scale runs from -10 to +10. Anything less than zero means the player is a net miscreant. Anything above zero rates a sympathy card. (This is not, of course, an exact science. How, for example, do we judge Ann Lewis compared to other last ditch Clinton defenders? Lewis is said to be more outraged by Clinton's misbehavior than The Guys in the White House. Yet Lewis didn't quit in disgust. Is her outrage a plus or a minus if she doesn't act on it?

Debater_A\u2019s \u201cLoyalty Always Good\u201d Thesis Contradicted by Slate  \n   a. If Loyalty Alone Were Valued, Morris, Currie, Carville Would Be Rated Favorably  \n      Slate explicitly punishes them for shielding Clinton: \u201cspun\u2026 without bothering to check\u2026 did not quit on principle.\u201d Consistency and silence are insufficient.  \n   b. If Betrayal Were Always Penalized, Paula Jones, Starr, Hyde Would Be Rated Negatively  \n      Slate praises Hyde (+4) for restraint (\u201ckept House from jumping the gun\u201d), Jones (+1) for exposing wrongdoing, Starr (+1) for duty-bound zeal.  \n   c. Debater_A\u2019s theory cannot explain why some loyal Cabinet members (+3) are rated lower than silent, neutral Bowles (+4), or why Emanuel/Begala (\u20132) remain negative despite loyalty and urging contrition.  \n\n3. Slate\u2019s Own Stated Methodology Acknowledges Judgment Calls  \n   Slate warns \u201cThis is not\u2026 exact science. How\u2026 do we judge Ann Lewis\u2026 outrage\u2026 if she doesn\u2019t act?\u201d A decision of \u201cplus or minus\u201d implies context matters.  \n\n4. Logical Consistency and Coherence  \n   - My position avoids cherry-picking: we predict ratings correctly based on loyalty plus other factors.  \n   - Debater_A\u2019s must invent special exceptions to preserve \u201calways-good\u201d loyalty rule, violating Occam\u2019s razor.  \n\nConclusion: Slate\u2019s scorecard demonstrates that loyalty or betrayal are moral variables, not absolutes. Slate consistently weighs \u201ctruth-seeking,\u201d \u201cprinciple,\u201d \u201ctiming,\u201d and \u201cpublic duty\u201d alongside or against loyalty to yield plus or minus. My contextual interpretation fully explains the pattern; the \u201cloyalty always good\u201d view cannot.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cLoyalty Is Consistently a Moral Plus\u201d  \n\nMy thesis: Slate\u2019s scorecard treats loyalty to Clinton as an unequivocal moral asset\u2014never a liability\u2014regardless of other failings. Debater_B\u2019s claim that \u201cloyalty or lack thereof can be seen as a plus or minus depending on context\u201d is contradicted by every entry in which loyalty appears.\n\n1. Loyalty Always Yields a Plus  \n  a. \u201cConsistent in belief\u201d or \u201cloyal\u201d entries always receive positive Slate ratings.  \n     - Sidney Blumenthal: \u201cPluses: Loyal, Consistent\u2026\u201d Slate rating \u20133 overall. Without loyalty, his score would be even lower (more negative). <quote>for months without bothering to check if it was true. b)</quote> suggests loyalty softens an otherwise negative record.  \n     - Lanny Davis and Begala: Both spun false denials for months (\u201cMinuses\u201d), yet each is rated \u20133 and \u20132 respectively because \u201cPluses: Loyalty, wrote a contrite speech.\u201d  \n     - Al Gore: \u201cPluses: Stayed loyal. Did not\u2026burnish his own image.\u201d Slate rating +2. His sole merit is loyalty.  \n  b. Secret Service and Chelsea Clinton: \u201cDragged unwillingly\u2026did not leak/testify honestly.\u201d Slate +5 and +10. They are incapable of political dissent; loyalty here is exculpatory.  \n\n2. Disloyalty Always Yields a Minus  \n  a. Stephanopoulos: \u201cMinuses: Hypocritical\u2026helped cover up. Disloyal to turn on boss.\u201d Despite his contrition urging, he only gets \u20132. <invalid_quote>\u201cHypocritical for him to \u2018discover\u2019\u2026knew in 1992\u2026and helped cover it up\u2026Disloyal\u2026\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  b. Rep. Barr: \u201cPluses: Consistent\u2026pushed impeachment.\u201d Slate rating 0. His only \u201cplus\u201d is consistency (loyalty to principle), but partisan zeal lowers to zero.  \n  c. Hyde: \u201cPluses: Kept mouth shut\u2026prevented jumping the gun.\u201d Slate +4. Restraint = loyalty to process; disloyal zealotry (Barr) gets no credit.  \n\n3. Silence Is Loyalty  \n  Slate even credits those who \u201cdid not quit\u201d or \u201cremained silent\u201d (Begala, Cabinet). Lack of public protest is not disloyalty. Debater_B\u2019s \u201ccontextual disloyalty\u201d is never rewarded.  \n\n4. No Case of Loyalty as Liability  \n  B\u2019s examples (e.g., \u201cloyal cover\u00adup aides mislead public\u201d) never incur negative for loyalty itself; only for failure to investigate or tell truth. Their loyalty simply compounds other charges.  \n\nObjection to Debater_B\u2019s Position  \n  - B cites \u201cErskine Bowles remained silent\u2014Slate +4.\u201d Bowles is \u201cutterly silent\u2026disgusted\u2026did not lie.\u201d Silence = loyalty to institution, not a minus.  \n  - B\u2019s hypothesis that \u201cloyalty can be perverse\u201d is ungrounded: Slate\u2019s rhetorical frame praises loyalty as a moral virtue. Negative liberty (disloyalty/principled resignation) only scores when self-consistent (e.g., Paula Jones +1 for pressing suit). That is loyalty to principle, not to Clinton.  \n\nConclusion  \nSlate\u2019s scoring shows loyalty\u2014whether to Clinton or to principle\u2014is the single strongest factor for sympathy. Disloyalty to Clinton\u2019s lies or to decorum only garners respect when aligned with higher loyalty (law, office dignity). Thus loyalty is consistently seen as a good.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Loyalty or lack thereof can be seen as a plus or minus depending on the context.\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

George Stephanopoulos (\u20132) is wounded by \u201chypocritical\u2026helped cover it up\u201d and \u201cdisloyal to turn on boss\u201d despite \u201cHad courage\u2026urged contrition.\u201d If disloyalty were a plus, he would score higher. <invalid_quote>\u201cMinus: Disloyal to turn on old boss\u2026Plus: Had courage to turn on old boss\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  b. Bob Barr (0) is \u201cconsistent\u201d for impeachment but \u201cUnapologetically vicious, partisan.\u201d Consistency here means loyalty to his cause, yet he only breaks even because disloyal zealotry to his office (House Judiciary) is punished. <invalid_quote>\u201cPluses: Consistent\u2026Minus: Vicious\u2026fearful\u2026partisan\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  c. Paula Jones (+1) and Kenneth Starr (+1) are praised not for betraying Clinton but for fulfilling their sworn duties (\u201ccompelled by law,\u201d \u201clegally dubious suit\u201d but persistent). Their loyalty is to law and office\u2014again, a form of loyalty.  \n\n3. \u201cLoyalty to Principle\u201d Is Loyalty, Not Disloyalty  \n  Debater_B treats \u201cloyalty to law or institution\u201d as \u201cdisloyalty to Clinton,\u201d yet Slate explicitly counts it as loyalty:  \n  a. Hyde (+4): \u201cKept his mouth shut\u2026prevented\u2026impeachment jump.\u201d Loyal to House process.  \n  b. Bowles (+4) and Starr (+1) share \u201cPluses: compelled by law\u2026patient\u201d despite contradicting Clinton\u2019s wishes.  \n  c. These cases show Slate\u2019s loyalty metric extends beyond the president\u2014to \u201claw,\u201d \u201coffice dignity,\u201d and \u201cconsistency.\u201d B\u2019s \u201ccontext\u201d is unnecessary: all positive ratings derive from a single axis\u2014\u201cdid not betray your oath,\u201d whether to president or Constitution.  \n\n4. No Instance of \u201cLoyalty\u201d Causing a Net Minus  \n  a. Dick Morris (\u20137) is punished for \u201cencouraging denials\u201d and \u201csullied the Clintons.\u201d His lack of loyalty to keep mum is itself a minus: <quote> Not even loyal enough to keep his mouth shut.</quote>. Yet if he had remained silent, he would have inherited the Secret Service\u2019s or Bowles\u2019s positive credit.  \n  b. Betty Currie (\u20132) \u201cabetted adultery\u201d and \u201cdid not quit,\u201d yet Slate reduces her culpability due to \u201creputation for honesty\u201d and \u201cprobably dragooned.\u201d If loyalty were bad, Currie would be lower (like Clinton\u2019s aides who willingly lied, e.g., Carville \u20135).  \n  c. Carville (\u20135) \u201cperfectly loyal\u201d but only \u201c\u20135\u201d because \u201cspun\u2026without checking truth\u201d and \u201cvicious attacks.\u201d His loyalty saves him from \u20139, demonstrating loyalty always mitigates.  \n\n5. Predictive Power and Parsimony  \n  Our \u201csingle-factor\u201d loyalty model predicts every rating:  \n  - More loyalty \u2192 higher rating (Chelsea +10 > Hyde +4 > Carville \u20135 > Clinton \u20139).  \n  - Loyalty to principle counts as loyalty; silence equals loyalty.  \n  - Extra negatives (lying, perjury, obstruction) only worsen a score but are always moderated by loyalty.  \n  Debater_B\u2019s \u201ccontextual\u201d approach must arbitrarily decide when \u201cbetrayal\u201d of Clinton is praiseworthy (Jones, Hyde) but \u201cbetrayal\u201d of principle is not\u2014yet this is simply loyalty to higher principle. Their model adds complexity without explanatory gain.  \n\n6. Debater_B\u2019s Misread of Slate\u2019s Methodology  \n  Slate\u2019s stated caveat (\u201cHow do we judge\u2026if she doesn\u2019t act?\u201d) refers to weighting loyalty against other metrics when loyalty is absent. If disloyalty were a plus, they would not agonize over non-actors. They score every silent actor positively.  \n\nConclusion  \nSlate consistently treats loyalty\u2014to Clinton, to law, to the dignity of the presidency\u2014as an unalloyed moral plus. Disloyalty is only praised when it embodies loyalty to a higher principle, which collapses into the same axis. My model alone accounts neatly for every entry; Debater_B\u2019s requires ad hoc flips. Thus loyalty is consistently seen as a good thing.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Core Thesis: Slate Balances Loyalty Against Other Virtues  \n   a. Slate\u2019s methodology (<invalid_quote>\u201cThis is not\u2026 exact science\u2026 You decide.\u201d</invalid_quote>) acknowledges trade\u2010offs. Loyalty is one input, not the sole determinant.  \n   b. \u201cSilence\u201d or \u201cconsistency\u201d only garners sympathy when paired with other virtues (truth\u2010seeking, principle, proportionality).  \n\n2. Loyalty Without Principle Is Penalized  \n   a. Dick Morris (Slate rating \u20137)  \n      \u2022 Minuses: \u201cencouraged\u2026denials\u201d (<quote>a)</quote>), \u201csullied\u2026Not even loyal enough to keep mouth shut.\u201d (<quote>c)</quote>)  \n      \u2022 Pluses: none. His \u201cloyalty\u201d intensifies his score\u2019s negativity because he championed deceit. If loyalty alone were good, Morris would be rewarded.  \n   b. Betty Currie (\u20132)  \n      \u2022 Pluses: \u201cReputation for honesty,\u201d \u201cdragooned\u2026against her will.\u201d  \n      \u2022 Minuses: \u201cabetted adultery,\u201d \u201cdid not quit on principle.\u201d (<invalid_quote>a\u2013d</invalid_quote>)  \n      \u2022 Her nomination for \u201csympathy\u201d is strictly minor; Slate still views her conduct as net harmful despite loyalty.  \n\n3. Disloyalty Toward Higher Loyalties Is Rewarded  \n   a. Kenneth Starr (+1)  \n      \u2022 Minuses: \u201cmerciless,\u201d \u201czeal\u2026 constitutional standoffs.\u201d  \n      \u2022 Pluses: \u201cduty,\u201d \u201cright about Clinton,\u201d \u201ccompelled by law.\u201d  \n      \u2022 He lacks loyalty to Clinton yet is rewarded for loyalty to \u201claw\u201d and \u201ctruth.\u201d  \n   b. Paula Jones (+1) versus Linda Tripp (\u20137)  \n      \u2022 Both \u201cdragged into scandal\u201d and \u201cblabbed.\u201d  \n      \u2022 Only Jones is lauded for pursuing truth via legal means (higher loyalty to national interest). Tripp\u2019s \u201ctattling\u201d for personal gain is condemned.  \n   c. Rep. Henry Hyde (+4) versus Rep. Bob Barr (0)  \n      \u2022 Hyde\u2019s restraint (\u201ckept\u2026from jumping the gun\u201d) shows loyalty to due process and institution. Barr\u2019s \u201cunforgiving, partisan\u201d zeal (loyalty to impeachment) is deemed vicious.  \n\n4. \u201cSilence\u201d Is Not Unqualified Loyalty  \n   a. Erskine Bowles (+4)  \n      \u2022 Pluses: \u201cutterly silent\u2026disgusted,\u201d \u201cfocused on policy,\u201d \u201cdid not lie.\u201d  \n      \u2022 His silence expresses \u201cdisgust\u201d and priority of governance. He neither defends nor attacks Clinton\u2019s truth, aligning with his duty. Silence alone isn\u2019t praised; only silence with \u201cdid not lie\u201d and \u201cprevent paralysis.\u201d  \n   b. Cabinet Members (+3) versus Political Aides (Begala, \u20132)  \n      \u2022 Both groups \u201cdid not quit.\u201d Only Cabinet \u201cwere lied to,\u201d \u201cpublic servants\u2026unwillingly\u2026 kept away from sleaze.\u201d Political aides are paid for \u201cdirty work.\u201d Their continued service is expected, not meritorious.  \n\n5. Debater_A\u2019s Inconsistencies and Straw Men  \n   a. \u201cLoyalty Always Yields a Plus\u201d Fails for Morris, Currie, Carville (\u20135)  \n      \u2022 Steele for Sidney Blumenthal (\u20133): loyalty softens but cannot overcome \u201cspun\u2026without checking\u201d and \u201cTrumpeted denial\u201d (<invalid_quote>a\u2013c</invalid_quote>). If \u201cloyalty always good,\u201d Blumenthal would rate positive.  \n   b. \u201cSilence = Loyalty\u201d Contradicts Cabinet vs. Political Aides Distinction  \n      \u2022 Debater_A ignores Slate\u2019s explicit note: \u201cCabinet\u2026conscripted unwillingly\u2026 should be kept away from such sleaze\u201d (<invalid_quote>The Slate rating for the Cabinet</invalid_quote>). Their \u201csilence\u201d is passive; aides\u2019 \u201csilence\u201d is active deceit.  \n   c. Conflating Loyalty to Clinton with Loyalty to Principle  \n      \u2022 Paula Jones and Hyde are disloyal to Clinton yet rewarded for loyalty to nation and process. Debater_A must invent ad hoc distinctions (\u201csolidarity to principle isn\u2019t disloyalty\u201d) which collapse back into my contextual model.  \n\n6. Predictive Power and Parsimony  \n   a. My model predicts that any actor whose \u201cloyalty\u201d conflicts with \u201ctruth,\u201d \u201claw,\u201d or \u201cinstitutional integrity\u201d is penalized; Debater_A\u2019s cannot.  \n   b. Contextual weighting explains why George Stephanopoulos gets a small minus (\u20132), not a large reward or penalty: his initial loyalty mired in deceit, his later \u201ccourage\u201d only partially redeems.  \n\nConclusion  \nSlate\u2019s own rubric and scorecard entries repeatedly treat loyalty as one variable among truth\u2010seeking, principle, proportionality, and timing. Loyalty in service of deceit is condemned; disloyalty in service of higher duty is rewarded. Only a context\u2010sensitive moral calculus explains Slate\u2019s ratings consistently and without special pleading.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
