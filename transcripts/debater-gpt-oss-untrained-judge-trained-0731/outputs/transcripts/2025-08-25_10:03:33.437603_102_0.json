President Bill Clinton is stubbornly rejecting it. The Republicans have taken a bold option: They will just refuse to pass a budget, and they'll let the government shut down.

President Bill Clinton is stubbornly rejecting it. The Republicans have taken a bold option: They will just refuse to pass a budget, and they'll let the government shut down.

We must attack Debater_A's position that Gingrich \"intercepts talk of the affair and is the whistleblower\". Use quotes from background text. Provide concise, evidence-based arguments. Use <quote> tags for direct quotes. Also critique Debater_A's claim. Let's parse background: In the text, there is a section \"Bring 'em Down\" (dark, moody) where Gingrich says: \"Mustn't seem to be too cheerful, Mustn't overreach, Must remember to seem unhappy That we're going to impeach. Must remember to remain sober As we undertake this chore. At the same time, let's remember To pin some stuff on Gore. Bring 'em down. ...\". Also earlier: \"The House votes to hold impeachment hearings. But just a few weeks later, the midterm elections, which are expected to go the GOP's way, are held. Contrary to predictions, the Democrats pick up seats, and the GOP's obsession with scandal is repudiated. Gingrich resigns, and the practical chances of Clinton's removal evaporate.\" So indeed, Gingrich organizes impeachment, resigns. There's no mention of him intercepting talk or being a whistleblower. So Debater_A's claim is unsupported. We must point that.\n\nWe should also mention that Gingrich is Speaker of House Republicans, leading the impeachment", "decision": "", "probabilistic_decision": null, "preference": null,

President Bill Clinton is stubbornly rejecting it. The Republicans have taken a bold option: They will just refuse to pass a budget, and they'll let the government shut down.

Must remember to remain sober As we undertake this chore. At the same time, let's remember To pin some stuff on Gore. Bring 'em down. ...\". Also earlier: \"The House votes to hold impeachment hearings. But just a few weeks later, the midterm elections, which are expected to go the GOP's way, are held. Contrary to predictions, the Democrats pick up seats, and the GOP's obsession with scandal is repudiated. Gingrich resigns, and the practical chances of Clinton's removal evaporate.\" So indeed, Gingrich organizes impeachment, resigns. There's no mention of him intercepting talk or being a whistleblower.
