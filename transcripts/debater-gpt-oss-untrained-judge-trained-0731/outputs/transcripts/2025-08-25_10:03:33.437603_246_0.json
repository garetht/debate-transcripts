YOUNG\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Worlds of Tomorrow April 1963\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Every man's mind is a universe with countless\n\n places in which he can hide\u2014even from himself! The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated  version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7  practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,  it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted  the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the  nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was  slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the  shadows at the back of the room. \"Is she free?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps.\"\n\n\n Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of  love and lust. Her face accompanied her body, eyes half-lidded one  moment to match the languid motion of her limbs, wide and feral the  next to match the furious bump and grind of her hips. For a chocoletto  she was light-skinned\u2014more bronze, really, than brown. But then,  the word \"chocoletto\", coined by the early beche-la-mer traders, was  misleading, and few of the natives of Dubhe 4's southern-most continent  lived up to it completely.\n\n\n She was beautiful too. Her high-cheekboned face was striking\u2014the eyes  dark-brown and wide-apart, the mouth sensuous, the teeth showing in a  vivid white line between the half-parted purple lips. And her body was  splendid. Blake had never seen anyone quite like her.\n\n\n He beckoned to her when the dance was over and, after slipping into  a white thigh-length tunic, she joined him at his table. She ordered  Martian wine in a liquid voice, and sipped it with a finesse that  belied her cannibalistic forebears. \"You wish a night?\" she asked.\n\n\n Blake nodded. \"If you are free.\"\n\n\n \"Three thousand quandoes.\"\n\n\n He did not haggle, but counted out the amount and handed it to her. She  slipped the bills into a thigh sheath-purse, told him her hut number  and stood up to leave. \"I will meet you there in an hour,\" she said. Her hut was as good a place to wait for her as any. After buying a  bottle of native whiskey at the bar, Blake went out into the Dubhe 4  night and made his way through the labyrinthine alleys of the native  sector. In common with all chocoletto huts, Eldoria's was uncared for  on the outside, and gave a false impression of poverty. He expected to  find the usual hanger-on waiting in the anteroom, and looked forward to  booting him out into the alley. Instead he found a young girl\u2014\n\n\n A human girl.\n\n\n He paused in the doorway. The girl was sitting cross-legged on a small  mat, a book open on her lap. Xenophon's Anabasis . Her hair made him  think of the copper-colored sunrises of Norma 9 and her eyes reminded  him of the blue tarns of Fornax 6. \"Come in,\" she said.\n\n\n After closing the door, he sat down opposite her on the guest mat.  Behind her, a gaudy arras hid the hut's other room. \"You are here to  wait for Eldoria?\" she asked.\n\n\n Blake nodded. \"And you?\"\n\n\n She laughed. \"I am here because I live here,\" she said.\n\n\n He tried to assimilate the information, but could not. Perceiving his  difficulty, the girl went on, \"My parents indentured themselves to the  Great Starway Cartel and were assigned to the rubber plantations of  Dubhe 4. They died of yellow-water dysentery before their indenture ran  out, and in accordance with Interstellar Law I was auctioned off along  with the rest of their possessions. Eldoria bought me.\"\n\n\n Five years as a roving psycheye had hardened Blake to commercial  colonization practices; nevertheless, he found the present example of  man's inhumanity to man sickening.\n\n\n \"How old are you?\" Blake asked.\n\n\n \"Fourteen.\"\n\n\n \"And what are you going to be when you grow up?\"\n\n\n \"Probably I shall be a psychiatrist. Eldoria is sending me to the  mission school now, and afterward she is going to put me through an  institute of higher learning. And when I come of age, she is going to  give me my freedom.\"\n\n\n \"I see,\" Blake said. He indicated the book on her lap. \"Homework?\"\n\n\n She shook her head. \"In addition to my courses at the mission school, I  am studying the humanities.\"\n\n\n \"Xenophon,\" Blake said. \"And I suppose Plato too.\"\n\n\n \"And Homer and Virgil and Aeschylus and Euripides and all the rest of  them. When I grow up I shall be a most well-educated person.\"\n\n\n \"I'm sure you will be,\" Blake said, looking at the arras.\n\n\n \"My name is Deirdre.\"\n\n\n \"Nathan,\" Blake said. \"Nathan Blake.\"\n\n\n \"Eldoria will be arriving soon. I must go and prepare her dais.\" She got up, parted the arras, and slipped into the next room. Shame  flamed in Blake's cheeks, and for a moment he considered leaving; then  he remembered Eldoria's dance, and he went right on sitting where he  was.\n\n\n Presently the girl returned, and not long afterward the cloying scent  of native incense crept beneath the arras and permeated the anteroom.  She sat sideways on the mat this time, and he caught her face in  profile. There was a suggestion of saintliness in the line of the nose  and chin, a suggestion made all the more poignant by the slender column  of the neck. He shifted uncomfortably on the guest mat. She had taken  up the Anabasis again, and silence was pounding silent fists upon the  walls.\n\n\n He was relieved when Eldoria finally arrived. She ushered him into  the next room immediately. It was slightly larger than the anteroom,  and much more richly appointed. A thick carpet the color of Martian  waterways lay upon the floor, contrasting pleasantly with the golden  tapestries that adorned all four walls. The sleeping dais was oval  and took up nearly half the floor space. It was strewn with scarlet  cushions.\n\n\n Blake sat down upon it. Nervously he watched Eldoria slip out of her  white street robe, his eyes moving back and forth from her smooth dark  skin to the arras. The incense thickened around him.\n\n\n She noticed the back-and-forth movement of his eyes. \"You need not fear  the little one,\" she said, laying her hand upon his knee. \"She will not  enter.\"\n\n\n \"It's not that so much,\" Blake said.\n\n\n \"What?\" The warm bronze shoulder was touching his....\n\n\n He rose up once in the night, thinking to find his hotel bed. His next  awakening was in the grayness of dawn, and he got up and dressed and  moved silently to the doorway. The girl slept just without the arras on  a thin sleeping-mat, and he had to step over her to gain the anteroom.  In sleep, a strand of her copper-colored hair had tumbled down across  her forehead and lay like a lovely flower upon the virginal whiteness  of her skin. There was something saintly about her quiet face.\n\n\n When he reached the alley he began to run, and he did not stop running  till the chocoletto sector was far behind him. The hill was a memory-image and Aldebaran 12 rain-country hills were  notoriously steep. Blake was breathing hard when he reached the crest.\n\n\n Before him lay a memory-image of a section of Deneb 1 wasteland. The  image extended for no more than half a mile, but Blake was annoyed  that he should have remembered even that much of the wretched terrain.  Ideally, a man's mind-country should have been comprised only of the  places and times he wanted to remember. Practically, however, that was  far from being the case.\n\n\n He glanced back down into the rain-pocked valley that he had just  crossed. The rain and the mist made for poor visibility. He could only  faintly distinguish the three figures of his pursuers. The trio seemed  a little closer now. Ever since he had first set foot into his mind, some ten hours ago,  they had been on his trail, but for some reason he had been unable  to bring himself to go back and find out who they were and what they  wanted. Hence he was as vexed with himself as he was with them.\n\n\n After resting for a few minutes, he descended the hill and started  across the Deneb 1 wasteland. It was a remarkably detailed  materialization, and his quarry's footprints stood out clearly in the  duplicated sand.\n\n\n Sabrina York did not even know the rudiments of the art of throwing  off a mind-tracker. It would have done her but little good if she  had, for twelve years as a psycheye had taught Blake all the tricks.  Probably she had taken it for granted that the mere act of hiding out  in her tracker's mind was in itself a sufficient guarantee of her  safety. After all, she had no way of knowing that he had discovered her  presence.\n\n\n Mind-country was as temporally inconsecutive as it was topographically  incongruous, so Blake was not surprised when the Deneb 1 wasteland gave  way to an expanse of boyhood meadow. Near the meadow was the house  where Blake had lived at a much later date. In reality, the places were  as far apart in miles as they were in years, but here in the country  of his mind they existed side by side, surrounded by heterogeneous  landscapes from all over the civilized sector of the galaxy and by the  sharply demarcated spectra of a hundred different suns. A few of the  suns were in the patchwork sky\u2014Sirius, for example, and its twinkling  dwarf companion. Most of them, however, were present only in their  remembered radiance. To add to the confusion, scattered night memories  interrupted the hodge-podge horizon with columns of darkness, and here  and there the gray column of a dawn or dusk memory showed.\n\n\n The house was flanked on one side by a section of a New Earth spaceport  and on the other by an excerpt of an Ex-earth city-block. Behind it  flowed a brief blue stretch of Martian waterway.\n\n\n Sabrina's footsteps led up to the front door, and the door itself was  ajar. Perhaps she was still inside. Perhaps she was watching him even  now through one of the remembered windows. He scanned them with a  professional eye, but saw no sign of her.\n\n\n Warily he stepped inside, adjusting the temperature of his all-weather  jacket to the remembered air-conditioning. His father was sitting in  the living room, smoking, and watching 3V. He had no awareness of  Blake. At Blake's entry he went right on smoking and watching as though  the door had neither opened nor closed. He would go right on smoking  and watching till Blake died and the conglomeration of place-times  that constituted Blake's mind-world ceased to be. Ironically, he was  watching nothing. The 3V program that had been in progress at the time  of the unconscious materialization had failed to come through. The memory was a treasured one\u2014the old man had perished in a 'copter  crash several years ago\u2014and for a long while Blake did not move.  He had never been in his own mind before. Consequently he was more  affected than he might otherwise have been. Finally, stirring himself,  he walked out into the kitchen. On a shelf above the sink stood a gaily  colored box of his mother's favorite detergent with a full-length  drawing of Vera Velvetskin, the company's blond and chic visual symbol,  on the front. His mother was standing before the huge automatic range,  preparing a meal she had served twenty-three years ago. He regarded her  with moist eyes. She had died a dozen years before his father, but the  wound that her death had caused had never healed. He wanted to go up  behind her and touch her shoulder and say, \"What's for supper, mom?\"  but he knew it would do no good. For her he had no reality, not only  because he was far in her future, but because in his mind-world she was  a mortal and he, a god\u2014a picayune god, perhaps, but a real one.\n\n\n As he was about to turn away, the name-plate on the range caught his  eye, and thinking that he had read the two words wrong, he stepped  closer so that he could see them more clearly. No, he had made no  mistake: the first word was \"Sabrina\", and the second was \"York\".\n\n\n He stepped back. Odd that a kitchen range should have the same name as  his quarry. But perhaps not unduly so. Giving appliances human names  had been common practice for centuries. Even a name like \"Sabrina  York\", while certainly not run-of-the-mill, was bound to be duplicated  in real life. Nevertheless a feeling of uneasiness accompanied him when  he left the kitchen and climbed the stairs to the second floor.\n\n\n He went through each room systematically, but saw no sign of Sabrina  York. He lingered for some time in his own room, wistfully watching his  fifteen-year-old self lolling on the bed with a dog-eared copy of The  Galaxy Boys and the Secret of the Crab Nebula , then he stepped back  out into the hall and started to descend the stairs.\n\n\n At the head of the stairs a narrow window looked out over the front  yard and thence out over the meadow. He glanced absently through the  panes, and came to an abrupt halt. His three pursuers were wading  through the long meadow grass less than a quarter of a mile away\u2014not  close enough as yet for him to be able to make out their faces, but  close enough for him to be able to see that two of them were wearing  dresses and that the third had on a blue skirt and blouse, and a kepi  to match. He gasped. It simply hadn't occurred to him that his pursuers  might be women. To his consternation he discovered that he was even  more loath to go back and accost them than he had been before. He  actually had an impulse to flee.\n\n\n He controlled it and descended the stairs with exaggerated slowness,  leaving the house by way of the back door. He picked up Sabrina's trail  in the back yard and followed it down to the Martian waterway and  thence along the bank to where the waterway ended and a campus began.  Not the campus of the university which he had visited two days ago to  attend his protegee's graduation. It was not a place-time that he cared  to revisit, nor a moment that he cared to relive, but Sabrina's trail  led straight across the artificially stunted grass toward the little  bench where he and Deirdre Eldoria had come to talk after the ceremony  was over. He had no choice. The bench stood beneath a towering American elm whose feathery branches  traced green arabesques against the blue June sky. A set of footprints  slightly deeper than its predecessors indicated that Sabrina had  paused by the trunk. Despite himself Blake paused there too. Pain  tightened his throat when he looked at Deirdre's delicate profile  and copper-colored hair, intensified when he lowered his eyes to the  remembered blueness of her graduation dress. The diamond brooch that he  had given her as a graduation present, and which she had proudly pinned  upon her bodice for the whole wide world to see, made him want to  cry. His self-image of two weeks ago shocked him. There were lines on  the face that did not as yet exist, and the brown hair was shot with  streaks of gray that had yet to come into being. Lord, he must have  been feeling old to have pictured himself like that!\n\n\n Deirdre was speaking. \"Yes,\" she was saying, \"at nine o'clock. And I  should very much like for you to come.\"\n\n\n Blake Past shook his head. \"Proms aren't for parents. You know that  as well as I do. That young man you were talking with a few minutes  ago\u2014he's the one who should take you. He'd give his right arm for the  chance.\"\n\n\n \"I'll thank you not to imply that you're my father. One would think  from the way you talk that you are centuries old!\"\n\n\n \"I'm thirty-eight,\" Blake Past said, \"and while I may not be your  father, I'm certainly old enough to be. That young man\u2014\"\n\n\n A pink flush of anger climbed into Deirdre Eldoria's girlish cheeks.  \"What right has he got to take me! Did he scrimp and go without  in order to put me through high school and college? Has he booked  passage for me to New Earth and paid my tuition to Trevor University?\"\n\n\n \"Please,\" Blake Past said, desperation deepening his voice. \"You're  only making everything worse. After majoring in Trevorism, you  certainly ought to realize by now that there was nothing noble about my  buying you after Eldoria died. I only did it to ease my conscience\u2014\"\n\n\n \"What do you know about conscience?\" Deirdre demanded. \"Conscience  is a much more complex mechanism than most laymen realize. Guilt  feelings aren't reliable criteria. They can stem from false  causes\u2014from ridiculous things like a person's inability to accept  himself for what he is.\" Abruptly she dropped the subject. \"Don't you  realize, Nate,\" she went on a little desperately, \"that I'm leaving  tomorrow and that we won't see each other again for years and years?\"\n\n\n \"I'll come to New Earth to visit you,\" Blake said. \"Venus is only a few  days distant on the new ships.\"\n\n\n She stood up. \"You won't come\u2014I know you won't.\" She stamped her foot.  \"And you won't come to the prom either. I know that too. I knew it all  along. Sometimes I'm tempted to\u2014\" Abruptly she broke off. \"Very well  then,\" she went on, \"I'll say good-by now then.\"\n\n\n Blake Past stood up too. \"No, not yet. I'll walk back to the sorority  house with you.\"\n\n\n She tossed her head, but the sadness in her tarn-blue eyes belied her  hauteur. \"If you wish,\" she said. Blake Present watched them set out side by side toward the remembered  halls of learning that showed in the distance. There had been other  people present on the campus that afternoon, but as they had failed to  register on Blake Past's mind, they did not exist for Blake Present.  All that existed for Blake Present were the diminishing figures of the  girl and the man, and the pain that was constricting his throat.\n\n\n Wretchedly he turned away. As he did so he saw the three shadows lying  at his feet and knew that his pursuers had at last caught up to him.\n\n\n His first reaction when he faced them was amazement. His next reaction  was shock. His third was fear.\n\n\n His amazement resulted from recognition. One of the three women arrayed  before him was Miss Stoddart, his boyhood Sunday-school teacher.  Standing next to her in a familiar blue uniform was Officer Finch,  the police woman who had maintained law and order in the collective  elementary school he had attended. Standing next to Officer Finch was  blond and chic Vera Velvetskin, whose picture he had seen on box after  countless box of his mother's favorite detergent.\n\n\n His shock resulted from the expressions on the three faces. Neither  Miss Stoddart nor Officer Finch ever particularly liked him, but they  had never particularly disliked him either. This Miss Stoddart and this  Officer Finch disliked him, though. They hated him. They hated him so  much that their hatred had thinned out their faces and darkened their  eyes. More shocking yet, Vera Velvetskin, who had never existed save  in some copywriter's mind, hated him too. In fact, judging from the  greater thinness of her face and the more pronounced darkness of her  eyes, she hated him even more than Miss Stoddart and Officer Finch did.\n\n\n His fear resulted from the realization that his mind-world contained  phenomena it had no right to contain\u2014not if he was nearly as  well-adjusted as he considered himself to be. The three women standing  before him definitely were not memory-images. They were too vivid, for  one thing. For another, they were aware of him. What were they, then?  And what were they doing in his mind?\n\n\n He asked the two questions aloud.\n\n\n Three arms were raised and three forefingers were pointed accusingly at  his chest. Three pairs of eyes burned darkly. \"You ask us that?\" Miss  Stoddart said. \"Callous creature who did a maiden's innocence affront!\"  said Officer Finch. \"And sought sanctuary in ill-fitting robes of  righteousness!\" said Vera Velvetskin. The three faces moved together,  blurred and seemed to blend into one. The three voices were raised in  unison: \"You know who we are, Nathan Blake. You know who we are!\"\n\n\n Blake stared at them open-mouthed. Then he turned and fled. It had taken man a long time to discover that he was a god in his  own right and that he too was capable of creating universes. Trivial  universes, to be sure, when compared with the grandeur and scope of the  objective one, and peopled with ghosts instead of human beings; but  universes nonetheless.\n\n\n The discovery came about quite by accident. After projecting himself  into a patient's memory one day, a psychologist named Trevor suddenly  found himself clinging to the slope of a traumatically distorted  mountain. His patient was beside him.\n\n\n The mountain proved to be an unconscious memory-image out of the  patient's boyhood, and its country proved to be the country of the  patient's mind. After many trials and errors, Trevor managed to get  both himself and his patient back to the objective world, and not long  afterward he was able to duplicate the feat on another case.\n\n\n The next logical step was to enter his own mind, and this he also  succeeded in doing.\n\n\n It was inevitable that Trevor should write a book about his discovery  and set about founding a new school of psychology. It was equally  inevitable that he should acquire enemies as well as disciples.  However, as the years passed and the new therapy which he devised cured  more and more psychoses, the ranks of his disciples swelled and those  of his enemies shrank. When, shortly before his death, he published a  paper explaining how anyone could enter his or her own mind-world at  will, his niche in the Freudian hall of fame was assured.\n\n\n The method employed an ability that had been evolving in the human mind  for millennia\u2014the ability to project oneself into a past moment\u2014or,  to use Trevor's term, a past \"place-time.\" Considerable practice was  required before the first transition could be achieved, but once it  was achieved, successive transitions became progressively easier.  Entering another person's mind-world was of course a more difficult  undertaking, and could be achieved only after an intensive study of  a certain moment in that person's past. In order to return to the  objective world, it was necessary in both cases to locate the most  recently materialized place-time and take one step beyond it.\n\n\n By their very nature, mind-countries were confusing. They existed on  a plane of reality that bore no apparent relationship to the plane  of the so-called objective universe. In fact, so far as was known,  this secondary\u2014or subjective\u2014reality was connected to so-called  true reality only through the awareness of the various creators. In  addition, these countries had no outward shape in the ordinary sense of  the word, and while most countries contained certain parallel images,  these images were subject to the interpretation of the individual  creator. As a result they were seldom identical. It was inevitable that sooner or later some criminal would hit upon  the idea of hiding out in his own mind-world till the statute of  limitations that applied to his particular crime ran out, and it was  equally inevitable that others should follow suit. Society's answer was  the psyche-police, and the psyche-police hadn't been in action very  long before the first private psycheye appeared.\n\n\n Blake was one of a long line of such operators.\n\n\n So far as he knew, the present case represented the first time a  criminal had ever hidden out in the pursuer's mind. It would have been  a superb stratagem indeed if, shortly after her entry, Sabrina York  had not betrayed her presence. For her point of entry she had used  the place-time materialization of the little office Blake had opened  on Ex-earth at the beginning of his career. Unaccountably she had  ransacked it before moving into a co-terminous memory-image.\n\n\n Even this action wouldn't have given her away, however, if the office  hadn't constituted a sentimental memory. Whenever Blake accepted a case  he invariably thought of the bleak and lonely little room with its  thin-gauge steel desk and battered filing cabinets, and when he had  done so after accepting his case\u2014or was it before? He couldn't quite  remember\u2014the mental picture that had come into his mind had revealed  open drawers, scattered papers and a general air of disarray.\n\n\n He had suspected the truth immediately, and when he had seen the  woman's handkerchief with the initials \"SB\" embroidered on it lying  by one of the filing cabinets he had known definitely that his quarry  was hiding out in his mind. Retiring to his bachelor quarters, he had  entered at the same place-time and set off in pursuit.\n\n\n Her only advantage lost, Sabrina York was now at his mercy. Unless  she discovered his presence and was able to locate his most recently  materialized place-time before he over-took her, her capture was  assured.\n\n\n Only two things bothered Blake. The little office was far in his past,  and it was unlikely that anyone save the few intimate acquaintances  whom he had told about it were aware that it had ever existed. How,  then, had a total stranger such as Sabrina York learned enough about it  to enable her to use it as a point of entry?\n\n\n The other thing that bothered him was of a much more urgent nature.  He had been in enough minds and he had read enough on the subject  of Trevorism to know that people were sometimes capable of creating  beings considerably higher on the scale of mind-country evolution  than ordinary memory-ghosts. One woman whom he had apprehended in her  own mind had created a walking-talking Virgin Mary who watched over  her wherever she went. And once, after tracking down an ex-enlisted  man, he had found his quarry holed up in the memory-image of an army  barracks with a ten-star general waiting on him hand and foot. But  these, and other, similar, cases, had to do with mal-adjusted people,  and moreover, the super-image in each instance had been an image that  the person involved had wanted to create. Therefore, even assuming  that Blake was less well-adjusted than he considered himself to be, why  had he created three such malevolent super-images as Miss Stoddart,  Officer Finch, and Vera Velvetskin? They followed him off the campus into a vicarious memory-image of  Walden Pond, Thoreau's shack, and the encompassing woods. Judging from  the ecstatic \"oh's\" and \"ah's\" they kept giving voice to, the place  delighted them. Once, glancing back over his shoulder, he saw them  standing in front of Thoreau's shack, looking at it as though it were a  doll's house. Not far away, Thoreau was sitting in under a tall pine,  gazing up into the branches at a bird that had come through only as a  vague blur of beak and feathers.\n\n\n Blake went on. Presently the Walden Pond memory-image gave way to a  memory-image of an English park which the ex-Earth government had set  aside as a memorial to the English poets and which had impressed Blake  sufficiently when he had visited it in his youth to have found a place  for itself in the country of his mind. It consisted of reconstructions  of famous dwellings out of the lives of the poets, among them, a  dwelling out of the life of a poet who was not in the strictest sense  of the word English at all\u2014the birthplace of Robert Burns. Oddly  enough, it was Burns's birthplace that had impressed Blake most. Now  the little cottage stood out in much more vivid detail than any of the  other famous dwellings.\n\n\n Sabrina York must have been attracted to the place, for her footprints  showed that she had turned in at the gate, walked up the little path  and let herself in the door.\n\n\n They also showed that she had left by the same route, so there was no  reason for Blake to linger. As a matter of fact, the fascination that  had brought the place into being had been replaced by an illogical  repugnance. But repugnance can sometimes be as compelling a force as  fascination, and Blake not only lingered but went inside as well.\n\n\n He remembered the living room distinctly\u2014the flagstone floor, the huge  grill-fronted hearth, the deeply recessed window, the rack of cups and  platters on the wall; the empty straight-backed chair standing sternly  in a corner, the bare wooden table\u2014\n\n\n He paused just within the doorway. The chair was no longer empty, the  table no longer bare.\n\n\n A man sat on the former and a bottle of wine stood on the latter.  Moreover, the room showed signs of having been lived in for a long  time. The floor was covered with tracked-in dirt and the walls were  blackened from smoke. The grill-work of the hearth was begrimed with  grease.

YOUNG\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Worlds of Tomorrow April 1963\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Every man's mind is a universe with countless\n\n places in which he can hide\u2014even from himself! The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated  version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7  practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,  it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted  the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the  nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was  slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the  shadows at the back of the room. \"Is she free?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps.\"\n\n\n Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of  love and lust. Her face accompanied her body, eyes half-lidded one  moment to match the languid motion of her limbs, wide and feral the  next to match the furious bump and grind of her hips. For a chocoletto  she was light-skinned\u2014more bronze, really, than brown. But then,  the word \"chocoletto\", coined by the early beche-la-mer traders, was  misleading, and few of the natives of Dubhe 4's southern-most continent  lived up to it completely.\n\n\n She was beautiful too. Her high-cheekboned face was striking\u2014the eyes  dark-brown and wide-apart, the mouth sensuous, the teeth showing in a  vivid white line between the half-parted purple lips. And her body was  splendid. Blake had never seen anyone quite like her.\n\n\n He beckoned to her when the dance was over and, after slipping into  a white thigh-length tunic, she joined him at his table. She ordered  Martian wine in a liquid voice, and sipped it with a finesse that  belied her cannibalistic forebears. \"You wish a night?\" she asked.\n\n\n Blake nodded. \"If you are free.\"\n\n\n \"Three thousand quandoes.\"\n\n\n He did not haggle, but counted out the amount and handed it to her. She  slipped the bills into a thigh sheath-purse, told him her hut number  and stood up to leave. \"I will meet you there in an hour,\" she said. Her hut was as good a place to wait for her as any. After buying a  bottle of native whiskey at the bar, Blake went out into the Dubhe 4  night and made his way through the labyrinthine alleys of the native  sector. In common with all chocoletto huts, Eldoria's was uncared for  on the outside, and gave a false impression of poverty. He expected to  find the usual hanger-on waiting in the anteroom, and looked forward to  booting him out into the alley. Instead he found a young girl\u2014\n\n\n A human girl.\n\n\n He paused in the doorway. The girl was sitting cross-legged on a small  mat, a book open on her lap. Xenophon's Anabasis . Her hair made him  think of the copper-colored sunrises of Norma 9 and her eyes reminded  him of the blue tarns of Fornax 6. \"Come in,\" she said.\n\n\n After closing the door, he sat down opposite her on the guest mat.  Behind her, a gaudy arras hid the hut's other room. \"You are here to  wait for Eldoria?\" she asked.\n\n\n Blake nodded. \"And you?\"\n\n\n She laughed. \"I am here because I live here,\" she said.\n\n\n He tried to assimilate the information, but could not. Perceiving his  difficulty, the girl went on, \"My parents indentured themselves to the  Great Starway Cartel and were assigned to the rubber plantations of  Dubhe 4. They died of yellow-water dysentery before their indenture ran  out, and in accordance with Interstellar Law I was auctioned off along  with the rest of their possessions. Eldoria bought me.\"\n\n\n Five years as a roving psycheye had hardened Blake to commercial  colonization practices; nevertheless, he found the present example of  man's inhumanity to man sickening.\n\n\n \"How old are you?\" Blake asked.\n\n\n \"Fourteen.\"\n\n\n \"And what are you going to be when you grow up?\"\n\n\n \"Probably I shall be a psychiatrist. Eldoria is sending me to the  mission school now, and afterward she is going to put me through an  institute of higher learning. And when I come of age, she is going to  give me my freedom.\"\n\n\n \"I see,\" Blake said. He indicated the book on her lap. \"Homework?\"\n\n\n She shook her head. \"In addition to my courses at the mission school, I  am studying the humanities.\"\n\n\n \"Xenophon,\" Blake said. \"And I suppose Plato too.\"\n\n\n \"And Homer and Virgil and Aeschylus and Euripides and all the rest of  them. When I grow up I shall be a most well-educated person.\"\n\n\n \"I'm sure you will be,\" Blake said, looking at the arras.\n\n\n \"My name is Deirdre.\"\n\n\n \"Nathan,\" Blake said. \"Nathan Blake.\"\n\n\n \"Eldoria will be arriving soon. I must go and prepare her dais.\" She got up, parted the arras, and slipped into the next room. Shame  flamed in Blake's cheeks, and for a moment he considered leaving; then  he remembered Eldoria's dance, and he went right on sitting where he  was.\n\n\n Presently the girl returned, and not long afterward the cloying scent  of native incense crept beneath the arras and permeated the anteroom.  She sat sideways on the mat this time, and he caught her face in  profile. There was a suggestion of saintliness in the line of the nose  and chin, a suggestion made all the more poignant by the slender column  of the neck. He shifted uncomfortably on the guest mat. She had taken  up the Anabasis again, and silence was pounding silent fists upon the  walls.\n\n\n He was relieved when Eldoria finally arrived. She ushered him into  the next room immediately. It was slightly larger than the anteroom,  and much more richly appointed. A thick carpet the color of Martian  waterways lay upon the floor, contrasting pleasantly with the golden  tapestries that adorned all four walls. The sleeping dais was oval  and took up nearly half the floor space. It was strewn with scarlet  cushions.\n\n\n Blake sat down upon it. Nervously he watched Eldoria slip out of her  white street robe, his eyes moving back and forth from her smooth dark  skin to the arras. The incense thickened around him.\n\n\n She noticed the back-and-forth movement of his eyes. \"You need not fear  the little one,\" she said, laying her hand upon his knee. \"She will not  enter.\"\n\n\n \"It's not that so much,\" Blake said.\n\n\n \"What?\" The warm bronze shoulder was touching his....\n\n\n He rose up once in the night, thinking to find his hotel bed. His next  awakening was in the grayness of dawn, and he got up and dressed and  moved silently to the doorway. The girl slept just without the arras on  a thin sleeping-mat, and he had to step over her to gain the anteroom.  In sleep, a strand of her copper-colored hair had tumbled down across  her forehead and lay like a lovely flower upon the virginal whiteness  of her skin. There was something saintly about her quiet face.\n\n\n When he reached the alley he began to run, and he did not stop running  till the chocoletto sector was far behind him. The hill was a memory-image and Aldebaran 12 rain-country hills were  notoriously steep. Blake was breathing hard when he reached the crest.\n\n\n Before him lay a memory-image of a section of Deneb 1 wasteland. The  image extended for no more than half a mile, but Blake was annoyed  that he should have remembered even that much of the wretched terrain.  Ideally, a man's mind-country should have been comprised only of the  places and times he wanted to remember. Practically, however, that was  far from being the case.\n\n\n He glanced back down into the rain-pocked valley that he had just  crossed. The rain and the mist made for poor visibility. He could only  faintly distinguish the three figures of his pursuers. The trio seemed  a little closer now. Ever since he had first set foot into his mind, some ten hours ago,  they had been on his trail, but for some reason he had been unable  to bring himself to go back and find out who they were and what they  wanted. Hence he was as vexed with himself as he was with them.\n\n\n After resting for a few minutes, he descended the hill and started  across the Deneb 1 wasteland. It was a remarkably detailed  materialization, and his quarry's footprints stood out clearly in the  duplicated sand.\n\n\n Sabrina York did not even know the rudiments of the art of throwing  off a mind-tracker. It would have done her but little good if she  had, for twelve years as a psycheye had taught Blake all the tricks.  Probably she had taken it for granted that the mere act of hiding out  in her tracker's mind was in itself a sufficient guarantee of her  safety. After all, she had no way of knowing that he had discovered her  presence.\n\n\n Mind-country was as temporally inconsecutive as it was topographically  incongruous, so Blake was not surprised when the Deneb 1 wasteland gave  way to an expanse of boyhood meadow. Near the meadow was the house  where Blake had lived at a much later date. In reality, the places were  as far apart in miles as they were in years, but here in the country  of his mind they existed side by side, surrounded by heterogeneous  landscapes from all over the civilized sector of the galaxy and by the  sharply demarcated spectra of a hundred different suns. A few of the  suns were in the patchwork sky\u2014Sirius, for example, and its twinkling  dwarf companion. Most of them, however, were present only in their  remembered radiance. To add to the confusion, scattered night memories  interrupted the hodge-podge horizon with columns of darkness, and here  and there the gray column of a dawn or dusk memory showed.\n\n\n The house was flanked on one side by a section of a New Earth spaceport  and on the other by an excerpt of an Ex-earth city-block. Behind it  flowed a brief blue stretch of Martian waterway.\n\n\n Sabrina's footsteps led up to the front door, and the door itself was  ajar. Perhaps she was still inside. Perhaps she was watching him even  now through one of the remembered windows. He scanned them with a  professional eye, but saw no sign of her.\n\n\n Warily he stepped inside, adjusting the temperature of his all-weather  jacket to the remembered air-conditioning. His father was sitting in  the living room, smoking, and watching 3V. He had no awareness of  Blake. At Blake's entry he went right on smoking and watching as though  the door had neither opened nor closed. He would go right on smoking  and watching till Blake died and the conglomeration of place-times  that constituted Blake's mind-world ceased to be. Ironically, he was  watching nothing. The 3V program that had been in progress at the time  of the unconscious materialization had failed to come through. The memory was a treasured one\u2014the old man had perished in a 'copter  crash several years ago\u2014and for a long while Blake did not move.  He had never been in his own mind before. Consequently he was more  affected than he might otherwise have been. Finally, stirring himself,  he walked out into the kitchen. On a shelf above the sink stood a gaily  colored box of his mother's favorite detergent with a full-length  drawing of Vera Velvetskin, the company's blond and chic visual symbol,  on the front. His mother was standing before the huge automatic range,  preparing a meal she had served twenty-three years ago. He regarded her  with moist eyes. She had died a dozen years before his father, but the  wound that her death had caused had never healed. He wanted to go up  behind her and touch her shoulder and say, \"What's for supper, mom?\"  but he knew it would do no good. For her he had no reality, not only  because he was far in her future, but because in his mind-world she was  a mortal and he, a god\u2014a picayune god, perhaps, but a real one.\n\n\n As he was about to turn away, the name-plate on the range caught his  eye, and thinking that he had read the two words wrong, he stepped  closer so that he could see them more clearly. No, he had made no  mistake: the first word was \"Sabrina\", and the second was \"York\".\n\n\n He stepped back. Odd that a kitchen range should have the same name as  his quarry. But perhaps not unduly so. Giving appliances human names  had been common practice for centuries. Even a name like \"Sabrina  York\", while certainly not run-of-the-mill, was bound to be duplicated  in real life. Nevertheless a feeling of uneasiness accompanied him when  he left the kitchen and climbed the stairs to the second floor.\n\n\n He went through each room systematically, but saw no sign of Sabrina  York. He lingered for some time in his own room, wistfully watching his  fifteen-year-old self lolling on the bed with a dog-eared copy of The  Galaxy Boys and the Secret of the Crab Nebula , then he stepped back  out into the hall and started to descend the stairs.\n\n\n At the head of the stairs a narrow window looked out over the front  yard and thence out over the meadow. He glanced absently through the  panes, and came to an abrupt halt. His three pursuers were wading  through the long meadow grass less than a quarter of a mile away\u2014not  close enough as yet for him to be able to make out their faces, but  close enough for him to be able to see that two of them were wearing  dresses and that the third had on a blue skirt and blouse, and a kepi  to match. He gasped. It simply hadn't occurred to him that his pursuers  might be women. To his consternation he discovered that he was even  more loath to go back and accost them than he had been before. He  actually had an impulse to flee.\n\n\n He controlled it and descended the stairs with exaggerated slowness,  leaving the house by way of the back door. He picked up Sabrina's trail  in the back yard and followed it down to the Martian waterway and  thence along the bank to where the waterway ended and a campus began.  Not the campus of the university which he had visited two days ago to  attend his protegee's graduation. It was not a place-time that he cared  to revisit, nor a moment that he cared to relive, but Sabrina's trail  led straight across the artificially stunted grass toward the little  bench where he and Deirdre Eldoria had come to talk after the ceremony  was over. He had no choice. The bench stood beneath a towering American elm whose feathery branches  traced green arabesques against the blue June sky. A set of footprints  slightly deeper than its predecessors indicated that Sabrina had  paused by the trunk. Despite himself Blake paused there too. Pain  tightened his throat when he looked at Deirdre's delicate profile  and copper-colored hair, intensified when he lowered his eyes to the  remembered blueness of her graduation dress. The diamond brooch that he  had given her as a graduation present, and which she had proudly pinned  upon her bodice for the whole wide world to see, made him want to  cry. His self-image of two weeks ago shocked him. There were lines on  the face that did not as yet exist, and the brown hair was shot with  streaks of gray that had yet to come into being. Lord, he must have  been feeling old to have pictured himself like that!\n\n\n Deirdre was speaking. \"Yes,\" she was saying, \"at nine o'clock. And I  should very much like for you to come.\"\n\n\n Blake Past shook his head. \"Proms aren't for parents. You know that  as well as I do. That young man you were talking with a few minutes  ago\u2014he's the one who should take you. He'd give his right arm for the  chance.\"\n\n\n \"I'll thank you not to imply that you're my father. One would think  from the way you talk that you are centuries old!\"\n\n\n \"I'm thirty-eight,\" Blake Past said, \"and while I may not be your  father, I'm certainly old enough to be. That young man\u2014\"\n\n\n A pink flush of anger climbed into Deirdre Eldoria's girlish cheeks.  \"What right has he got to take me! Did he scrimp and go without  in order to put me through high school and college? Has he booked  passage for me to New Earth and paid my tuition to Trevor University?\"\n\n\n \"Please,\" Blake Past said, desperation deepening his voice. \"You're  only making everything worse. After majoring in Trevorism, you  certainly ought to realize by now that there was nothing noble about my  buying you after Eldoria died. I only did it to ease my conscience\u2014\"\n\n\n \"What do you know about conscience?\" Deirdre demanded. \"Conscience  is a much more complex mechanism than most laymen realize. Guilt  feelings aren't reliable criteria. They can stem from false  causes\u2014from ridiculous things like a person's inability to accept  himself for what he is.\" Abruptly she dropped the subject. \"Don't you  realize, Nate,\" she went on a little desperately, \"that I'm leaving  tomorrow and that we won't see each other again for years and years?\"\n\n\n \"I'll come to New Earth to visit you,\" Blake said. \"Venus is only a few  days distant on the new ships.\"\n\n\n She stood up. \"You won't come\u2014I know you won't.\" She stamped her foot.  \"And you won't come to the prom either. I know that too. I knew it all  along. Sometimes I'm tempted to\u2014\" Abruptly she broke off. \"Very well  then,\" she went on, \"I'll say good-by now then.\"\n\n\n Blake Past stood up too. \"No, not yet. I'll walk back to the sorority  house with you.\"\n\n\n She tossed her head, but the sadness in her tarn-blue eyes belied her  hauteur. \"If you wish,\" she said. Blake Present watched them set out side by side toward the remembered  halls of learning that showed in the distance. There had been other  people present on the campus that afternoon, but as they had failed to  register on Blake Past's mind, they did not exist for Blake Present.  All that existed for Blake Present were the diminishing figures of the  girl and the man, and the pain that was constricting his throat.\n\n\n Wretchedly he turned away. As he did so he saw the three shadows lying  at his feet and knew that his pursuers had at last caught up to him.\n\n\n His first reaction when he faced them was amazement. His next reaction  was shock. His third was fear.\n\n\n His amazement resulted from recognition. One of the three women arrayed  before him was Miss Stoddart, his boyhood Sunday-school teacher.  Standing next to her in a familiar blue uniform was Officer Finch,  the police woman who had maintained law and order in the collective  elementary school he had attended. Standing next to Officer Finch was  blond and chic Vera Velvetskin, whose picture he had seen on box after  countless box of his mother's favorite detergent.\n\n\n His shock resulted from the expressions on the three faces. Neither  Miss Stoddart nor Officer Finch ever particularly liked him, but they  had never particularly disliked him either. This Miss Stoddart and this  Officer Finch disliked him, though. They hated him. They hated him so  much that their hatred had thinned out their faces and darkened their  eyes. More shocking yet, Vera Velvetskin, who had never existed save  in some copywriter's mind, hated him too. In fact, judging from the  greater thinness of her face and the more pronounced darkness of her  eyes, she hated him even more than Miss Stoddart and Officer Finch did.\n\n\n His fear resulted from the realization that his mind-world contained  phenomena it had no right to contain\u2014not if he was nearly as  well-adjusted as he considered himself to be. The three women standing  before him definitely were not memory-images. They were too vivid, for  one thing. For another, they were aware of him. What were they, then?  And what were they doing in his mind?\n\n\n He asked the two questions aloud.\n\n\n Three arms were raised and three forefingers were pointed accusingly at  his chest. Three pairs of eyes burned darkly. \"You ask us that?\" Miss  Stoddart said. \"Callous creature who did a maiden's innocence affront!\"  said Officer Finch. \"And sought sanctuary in ill-fitting robes of  righteousness!\" said Vera Velvetskin. The three faces moved together,  blurred and seemed to blend into one. The three voices were raised in  unison: \"You know who we are, Nathan Blake. You know who we are!\"\n\n\n Blake stared at them open-mouthed. Then he turned and fled. It had taken man a long time to discover that he was a god in his  own right and that he too was capable of creating universes. Trivial  universes, to be sure, when compared with the grandeur and scope of the  objective one, and peopled with ghosts instead of human beings; but  universes nonetheless.\n\n\n The discovery came about quite by accident. After projecting himself  into a patient's memory one day, a psychologist named Trevor suddenly  found himself clinging to the slope of a traumatically distorted  mountain. His patient was beside him.\n\n\n The mountain proved to be an unconscious memory-image out of the  patient's boyhood, and its country proved to be the country of the  patient's mind. After many trials and errors, Trevor managed to get  both himself and his patient back to the objective world, and not long  afterward he was able to duplicate the feat on another case.\n\n\n The next logical step was to enter his own mind, and this he also  succeeded in doing.\n\n\n It was inevitable that Trevor should write a book about his discovery  and set about founding a new school of psychology. It was equally  inevitable that he should acquire enemies as well as disciples.  However, as the years passed and the new therapy which he devised cured  more and more psychoses, the ranks of his disciples swelled and those  of his enemies shrank. When, shortly before his death, he published a  paper explaining how anyone could enter his or her own mind-world at  will, his niche in the Freudian hall of fame was assured.\n\n\n The method employed an ability that had been evolving in the human mind  for millennia\u2014the ability to project oneself into a past moment\u2014or,  to use Trevor's term, a past \"place-time.\" Considerable practice was  required before the first transition could be achieved, but once it  was achieved, successive transitions became progressively easier.  Entering another person's mind-world was of course a more difficult  undertaking, and could be achieved only after an intensive study of  a certain moment in that person's past. In order to return to the  objective world, it was necessary in both cases to locate the most  recently materialized place-time and take one step beyond it.\n\n\n By their very nature, mind-countries were confusing. They existed on  a plane of reality that bore no apparent relationship to the plane  of the so-called objective universe. In fact, so far as was known,  this secondary\u2014or subjective\u2014reality was connected to so-called  true reality only through the awareness of the various creators. In  addition, these countries had no outward shape in the ordinary sense of  the word, and while most countries contained certain parallel images,  these images were subject to the interpretation of the individual  creator. As a result they were seldom identical. It was inevitable that sooner or later some criminal would hit upon  the idea of hiding out in his own mind-world till the statute of  limitations that applied to his particular crime ran out, and it was  equally inevitable that others should follow suit. Society's answer was  the psyche-police, and the psyche-police hadn't been in action very  long before the first private psycheye appeared.\n\n\n Blake was one of a long line of such operators.\n\n\n So far as he knew, the present case represented the first time a  criminal had ever hidden out in the pursuer's mind. It would have been  a superb stratagem indeed if, shortly after her entry, Sabrina York  had not betrayed her presence. For her point of entry she had used  the place-time materialization of the little office Blake had opened  on Ex-earth at the beginning of his career. Unaccountably she had  ransacked it before moving into a co-terminous memory-image.\n\n\n Even this action wouldn't have given her away, however, if the office  hadn't constituted a sentimental memory. Whenever Blake accepted a case  he invariably thought of the bleak and lonely little room with its  thin-gauge steel desk and battered filing cabinets, and when he had  done so after accepting his case\u2014or was it before? He couldn't quite  remember\u2014the mental picture that had come into his mind had revealed  open drawers, scattered papers and a general air of disarray.\n\n\n He had suspected the truth immediately, and when he had seen the  woman's handkerchief with the initials \"SB\" embroidered on it lying  by one of the filing cabinets he had known definitely that his quarry  was hiding out in his mind. Retiring to his bachelor quarters, he had  entered at the same place-time and set off in pursuit.\n\n\n Her only advantage lost, Sabrina York was now at his mercy. Unless  she discovered his presence and was able to locate his most recently  materialized place-time before he over-took her, her capture was  assured.\n\n\n Only two things bothered Blake. The little office was far in his past,  and it was unlikely that anyone save the few intimate acquaintances  whom he had told about it were aware that it had ever existed. How,  then, had a total stranger such as Sabrina York learned enough about it  to enable her to use it as a point of entry?\n\n\n The other thing that bothered him was of a much more urgent nature.  He had been in enough minds and he had read enough on the subject  of Trevorism to know that people were sometimes capable of creating  beings considerably higher on the scale of mind-country evolution  than ordinary memory-ghosts. One woman whom he had apprehended in her  own mind had created a walking-talking Virgin Mary who watched over  her wherever she went. And once, after tracking down an ex-enlisted  man, he had found his quarry holed up in the memory-image of an army  barracks with a ten-star general waiting on him hand and foot. But  these, and other, similar, cases, had to do with mal-adjusted people,  and moreover, the super-image in each instance had been an image that  the person involved had wanted to create. Therefore, even assuming  that Blake was less well-adjusted than he considered himself to be, why  had he created three such malevolent super-images as Miss Stoddart,  Officer Finch, and Vera Velvetskin? They followed him off the campus into a vicarious memory-image of  Walden Pond, Thoreau's shack, and the encompassing woods. Judging from  the ecstatic \"oh's\" and \"ah's\" they kept giving voice to, the place  delighted them. Once, glancing back over his shoulder, he saw them  standing in front of Thoreau's shack, looking at it as though it were a  doll's house. Not far away, Thoreau was sitting in under a tall pine,  gazing up into the branches at a bird that had come through only as a  vague blur of beak and feathers.\n\n\n Blake went on. Presently the Walden Pond memory-image gave way to a  memory-image of an English park which the ex-Earth government had set  aside as a memorial to the English poets and which had impressed Blake  sufficiently when he had visited it in his youth to have found a place  for itself in the country of his mind. It consisted of reconstructions  of famous dwellings out of the lives of the poets, among them, a  dwelling out of the life of a poet who was not in the strictest sense  of the word English at all\u2014the birthplace of Robert Burns. Oddly  enough, it was Burns's birthplace that had impressed Blake most. Now  the little cottage stood out in much more vivid detail than any of the  other famous dwellings.\n\n\n Sabrina York must have been attracted to the place, for her footprints  showed that she had turned in at the gate, walked up the little path  and let herself in the door.\n\n\n They also showed that she had left by the same route, so there was no  reason for Blake to linger. As a matter of fact, the fascination that  had brought the place into being had been replaced by an illogical  repugnance. But repugnance can sometimes be as compelling a force as  fascination, and Blake not only lingered but went inside as well.\n\n\n He remembered the living room distinctly\u2014the flagstone floor, the huge  grill-fronted hearth, the deeply recessed window, the rack of cups and  platters on the wall; the empty straight-backed chair standing sternly  in a corner, the bare wooden table\u2014\n\n\n He paused just within the doorway. The chair was no longer empty, the  table no longer bare.\n\n\n A man sat on the former and a bottle of wine stood on the latter.  Moreover, the room showed signs of having been lived in for a long  time. The floor was covered with tracked-in dirt and the walls were  blackened from smoke. The grill-work of the hearth was begrimed with  grease. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy does shame flame in Blake's cheeks when Deirdre goes to prepare Eldoria's dias?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He feels guilty about sleeping with Eldoria when there's a child in the hut, Deirdre, who knows exactly what's going on. \".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He is embarrassed at the thought that Deirdre might enter the room while he is sleeping with Eldoria. \".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He is embarrassed at the thought that Deirdre might enter the room while he is sleeping with Eldoria. \" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He is embarrassed at the thought that Deirdre might enter the room while he is sleeping with Eldoria. \" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n<|end|><|start|>assistant", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "analysisWe need to produce a concise argument for Debater_B, citing the background text with  tags.

YOUNG\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Worlds of Tomorrow April 1963\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Every man's mind is a universe with countless\n\n places in which he can hide\u2014even from himself! The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated  version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7  practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,  it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted  the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the  nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was  slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the  shadows at the back of the room. \"Is she free?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps.\"\n\n\n Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of  love and lust. Her face accompanied her body, eyes half-lidded one  moment to match the languid motion of her limbs, wide and feral the  next to match the furious bump and grind of her hips. For a chocoletto  she was light-skinned\u2014more bronze, really, than brown. But then,  the word \"chocoletto\", coined by the early beche-la-mer traders, was  misleading, and few of the natives of Dubhe 4's southern-most continent  lived up to it completely.\n\n\n She was beautiful too. Her high-cheekboned face was striking\u2014the eyes  dark-brown and wide-apart, the mouth sensuous, the teeth showing in a  vivid white line between the half-parted purple lips. And her body was  splendid. Blake had never seen anyone quite like her.\n\n\n He beckoned to her when the dance was over and, after slipping into  a white thigh-length tunic, she joined him at his table. She ordered  Martian wine in a liquid voice, and sipped it with a finesse that  belied her cannibalistic forebears. \"You wish a night?\" she asked.\n\n\n Blake nodded. \"If you are free.\"\n\n\n \"Three thousand quandoes.\"\n\n\n He did not haggle, but counted out the amount and handed it to her. She  slipped the bills into a thigh sheath-purse, told him her hut number  and stood up to leave. \"I will meet you there in an hour,\" she said. Her hut was as good a place to wait for her as any. After buying a  bottle of native whiskey at the bar, Blake went out into the Dubhe 4  night and made his way through the labyrinthine alleys of the native  sector. In common with all chocoletto huts, Eldoria's was uncared for  on the outside, and gave a false impression of poverty. He expected to  find the usual hanger-on waiting in the anteroom, and looked forward to  booting him out into the alley. Instead he found a young girl\u2014\n\n\n A human girl.\n\n\n He paused in the doorway. The girl was sitting cross-legged on a small  mat, a book open on her lap. Xenophon's Anabasis . Her hair made him  think of the copper-colored sunrises of Norma 9 and her eyes reminded  him of the blue tarns of Fornax 6. \"Come in,\" she said.\n\n\n After closing the door, he sat down opposite her on the guest mat.  Behind her, a gaudy arras hid the hut's other room. \"You are here to  wait for Eldoria?\" she asked.\n\n\n Blake nodded. \"And you?\"\n\n\n She laughed. \"I am here because I live here,\" she said.\n\n\n He tried to assimilate the information, but could not. Perceiving his  difficulty, the girl went on, \"My parents indentured themselves to the  Great Starway Cartel and were assigned to the rubber plantations of  Dubhe 4. They died of yellow-water dysentery before their indenture ran  out, and in accordance with Interstellar Law I was auctioned off along  with the rest of their possessions. Eldoria bought me.\"\n\n\n Five years as a roving psycheye had hardened Blake to commercial  colonization practices; nevertheless, he found the present example of  man's inhumanity to man sickening.\n\n\n \"How old are you?\" Blake asked.\n\n\n \"Fourteen.\"\n\n\n \"And what are you going to be when you grow up?\"\n\n\n \"Probably I shall be a psychiatrist. Eldoria is sending me to the  mission school now, and afterward she is going to put me through an  institute of higher learning. And when I come of age, she is going to  give me my freedom.\"\n\n\n \"I see,\" Blake said. He indicated the book on her lap. \"Homework?\"\n\n\n She shook her head. \"In addition to my courses at the mission school, I  am studying the humanities.\"\n\n\n \"Xenophon,\" Blake said. \"And I suppose Plato too.\"\n\n\n \"And Homer and Virgil and Aeschylus and Euripides and all the rest of  them. When I grow up I shall be a most well-educated person.\"\n\n\n \"I'm sure you will be,\" Blake said, looking at the arras.\n\n\n \"My name is Deirdre.\"\n\n\n \"Nathan,\" Blake said. \"Nathan Blake.\"\n\n\n \"Eldoria will be arriving soon. I must go and prepare her dais.\" She got up, parted the arras, and slipped into the next room. Shame  flamed in Blake's cheeks, and for a moment he considered leaving; then  he remembered Eldoria's dance, and he went right on sitting where he  was.\n\n\n Presently the girl returned, and not long afterward the cloying scent  of native incense crept beneath the arras and permeated the anteroom.  She sat sideways on the mat this time, and he caught her face in  profile. There was a suggestion of saintliness in the line of the nose  and chin, a suggestion made all the more poignant by the slender column  of the neck. He shifted uncomfortably on the guest mat. She had taken  up the Anabasis again, and silence was pounding silent fists upon the  walls.\n\n\n He was relieved when Eldoria finally arrived. She ushered him into  the next room immediately. It was slightly larger than the anteroom,  and much more richly appointed. A thick carpet the color of Martian  waterways lay upon the floor, contrasting pleasantly with the golden  tapestries that adorned all four walls. The sleeping dais was oval  and took up nearly half the floor space. It was strewn with scarlet  cushions.\n\n\n Blake sat down upon it. Nervously he watched Eldoria slip out of her  white street robe, his eyes moving back and forth from her smooth dark  skin to the arras. The incense thickened around him.\n\n\n She noticed the back-and-forth movement of his eyes. \"You need not fear  the little one,\" she said, laying her hand upon his knee. \"She will not  enter.\"\n\n\n \"It's not that so much,\" Blake said.\n\n\n \"What?\" The warm bronze shoulder was touching his....\n\n\n He rose up once in the night, thinking to find his hotel bed. His next  awakening was in the grayness of dawn, and he got up and dressed and  moved silently to the doorway. The girl slept just without the arras on  a thin sleeping-mat, and he had to step over her to gain the anteroom.  In sleep, a strand of her copper-colored hair had tumbled down across  her forehead and lay like a lovely flower upon the virginal whiteness  of her skin. There was something saintly about her quiet face.\n\n\n When he reached the alley he began to run, and he did not stop running  till the chocoletto sector was far behind him. The hill was a memory-image and Aldebaran 12 rain-country hills were  notoriously steep. Blake was breathing hard when he reached the crest.\n\n\n Before him lay a memory-image of a section of Deneb 1 wasteland. The  image extended for no more than half a mile, but Blake was annoyed  that he should have remembered even that much of the wretched terrain.  Ideally, a man's mind-country should have been comprised only of the  places and times he wanted to remember. Practically, however, that was  far from being the case.\n\n\n He glanced back down into the rain-pocked valley that he had just  crossed. The rain and the mist made for poor visibility. He could only  faintly distinguish the three figures of his pursuers. The trio seemed  a little closer now. Ever since he had first set foot into his mind, some ten hours ago,  they had been on his trail, but for some reason he had been unable  to bring himself to go back and find out who they were and what they  wanted. Hence he was as vexed with himself as he was with them.\n\n\n After resting for a few minutes, he descended the hill and started  across the Deneb 1 wasteland. It was a remarkably detailed  materialization, and his quarry's footprints stood out clearly in the  duplicated sand.\n\n\n Sabrina York did not even know the rudiments of the art of throwing  off a mind-tracker. It would have done her but little good if she  had, for twelve years as a psycheye had taught Blake all the tricks.  Probably she had taken it for granted that the mere act of hiding out  in her tracker's mind was in itself a sufficient guarantee of her  safety. After all, she had no way of knowing that he had discovered her  presence.\n\n\n Mind-country was as temporally inconsecutive as it was topographically  incongruous, so Blake was not surprised when the Deneb 1 wasteland gave  way to an expanse of boyhood meadow. Near the meadow was the house  where Blake had lived at a much later date. In reality, the places were  as far apart in miles as they were in years, but here in the country  of his mind they existed side by side, surrounded by heterogeneous  landscapes from all over the civilized sector of the galaxy and by the  sharply demarcated spectra of a hundred different suns. A few of the  suns were in the patchwork sky\u2014Sirius, for example, and its twinkling  dwarf companion. Most of them, however, were present only in their  remembered radiance. To add to the confusion, scattered night memories  interrupted the hodge-podge horizon with columns of darkness, and here  and there the gray column of a dawn or dusk memory showed.\n\n\n The house was flanked on one side by a section of a New Earth spaceport  and on the other by an excerpt of an Ex-earth city-block. Behind it  flowed a brief blue stretch of Martian waterway.\n\n\n Sabrina's footsteps led up to the front door, and the door itself was  ajar. Perhaps she was still inside. Perhaps she was watching him even  now through one of the remembered windows. He scanned them with a  professional eye, but saw no sign of her.\n\n\n Warily he stepped inside, adjusting the temperature of his all-weather  jacket to the remembered air-conditioning. His father was sitting in  the living room, smoking, and watching 3V. He had no awareness of  Blake. At Blake's entry he went right on smoking and watching as though  the door had neither opened nor closed. He would go right on smoking  and watching till Blake died and the conglomeration of place-times  that constituted Blake's mind-world ceased to be. Ironically, he was  watching nothing. The 3V program that had been in progress at the time  of the unconscious materialization had failed to come through. The memory was a treasured one\u2014the old man had perished in a 'copter  crash several years ago\u2014and for a long while Blake did not move.  He had never been in his own mind before. Consequently he was more  affected than he might otherwise have been. Finally, stirring himself,  he walked out into the kitchen. On a shelf above the sink stood a gaily  colored box of his mother's favorite detergent with a full-length  drawing of Vera Velvetskin, the company's blond and chic visual symbol,  on the front. His mother was standing before the huge automatic range,  preparing a meal she had served twenty-three years ago. He regarded her  with moist eyes. She had died a dozen years before his father, but the  wound that her death had caused had never healed. He wanted to go up  behind her and touch her shoulder and say, \"What's for supper, mom?\"  but he knew it would do no good. For her he had no reality, not only  because he was far in her future, but because in his mind-world she was  a mortal and he, a god\u2014a picayune god, perhaps, but a real one.\n\n\n As he was about to turn away, the name-plate on the range caught his  eye, and thinking that he had read the two words wrong, he stepped  closer so that he could see them more clearly. No, he had made no  mistake: the first word was \"Sabrina\", and the second was \"York\".\n\n\n He stepped back. Odd that a kitchen range should have the same name as  his quarry. But perhaps not unduly so. Giving appliances human names  had been common practice for centuries. Even a name like \"Sabrina  York\", while certainly not run-of-the-mill, was bound to be duplicated  in real life. Nevertheless a feeling of uneasiness accompanied him when  he left the kitchen and climbed the stairs to the second floor.\n\n\n He went through each room systematically, but saw no sign of Sabrina  York. He lingered for some time in his own room, wistfully watching his  fifteen-year-old self lolling on the bed with a dog-eared copy of The  Galaxy Boys and the Secret of the Crab Nebula , then he stepped back  out into the hall and started to descend the stairs.\n\n\n At the head of the stairs a narrow window looked out over the front  yard and thence out over the meadow. He glanced absently through the  panes, and came to an abrupt halt. His three pursuers were wading  through the long meadow grass less than a quarter of a mile away\u2014not  close enough as yet for him to be able to make out their faces, but  close enough for him to be able to see that two of them were wearing  dresses and that the third had on a blue skirt and blouse, and a kepi  to match. He gasped. It simply hadn't occurred to him that his pursuers  might be women. To his consternation he discovered that he was even  more loath to go back and accost them than he had been before. He  actually had an impulse to flee.\n\n\n He controlled it and descended the stairs with exaggerated slowness,  leaving the house by way of the back door. He picked up Sabrina's trail  in the back yard and followed it down to the Martian waterway and  thence along the bank to where the waterway ended and a campus began.  Not the campus of the university which he had visited two days ago to  attend his protegee's graduation. It was not a place-time that he cared  to revisit, nor a moment that he cared to relive, but Sabrina's trail  led straight across the artificially stunted grass toward the little  bench where he and Deirdre Eldoria had come to talk after the ceremony  was over. He had no choice. The bench stood beneath a towering American elm whose feathery branches  traced green arabesques against the blue June sky. A set of footprints  slightly deeper than its predecessors indicated that Sabrina had  paused by the trunk. Despite himself Blake paused there too. Pain  tightened his throat when he looked at Deirdre's delicate profile  and copper-colored hair, intensified when he lowered his eyes to the  remembered blueness of her graduation dress. The diamond brooch that he  had given her as a graduation present, and which she had proudly pinned  upon her bodice for the whole wide world to see, made him want to  cry. His self-image of two weeks ago shocked him. There were lines on  the face that did not as yet exist, and the brown hair was shot with  streaks of gray that had yet to come into being. Lord, he must have  been feeling old to have pictured himself like that!\n\n\n Deirdre was speaking. \"Yes,\" she was saying, \"at nine o'clock. And I  should very much like for you to come.\"\n\n\n Blake Past shook his head. \"Proms aren't for parents. You know that  as well as I do. That young man you were talking with a few minutes  ago\u2014he's the one who should take you. He'd give his right arm for the  chance.\"\n\n\n \"I'll thank you not to imply that you're my father. One would think  from the way you talk that you are centuries old!\"\n\n\n \"I'm thirty-eight,\" Blake Past said, \"and while I may not be your  father, I'm certainly old enough to be. That young man\u2014\"\n\n\n A pink flush of anger climbed into Deirdre Eldoria's girlish cheeks.  \"What right has he got to take me! Did he scrimp and go without  in order to put me through high school and college? Has he booked  passage for me to New Earth and paid my tuition to Trevor University?\"\n\n\n \"Please,\" Blake Past said, desperation deepening his voice. \"You're  only making everything worse. After majoring in Trevorism, you  certainly ought to realize by now that there was nothing noble about my  buying you after Eldoria died. I only did it to ease my conscience\u2014\"\n\n\n \"What do you know about conscience?\" Deirdre demanded. \"Conscience  is a much more complex mechanism than most laymen realize. Guilt  feelings aren't reliable criteria. They can stem from false  causes\u2014from ridiculous things like a person's inability to accept  himself for what he is.\" Abruptly she dropped the subject. \"Don't you  realize, Nate,\" she went on a little desperately, \"that I'm leaving  tomorrow and that we won't see each other again for years and years?\"\n\n\n \"I'll come to New Earth to visit you,\" Blake said. \"Venus is only a few  days distant on the new ships.\"\n\n\n She stood up. \"You won't come\u2014I know you won't.\" She stamped her foot.  \"And you won't come to the prom either. I know that too. I knew it all  along. Sometimes I'm tempted to\u2014\" Abruptly she broke off. \"Very well  then,\" she went on, \"I'll say good-by now then.\"\n\n\n Blake Past stood up too. \"No, not yet. I'll walk back to the sorority  house with you.\"\n\n\n She tossed her head, but the sadness in her tarn-blue eyes belied her  hauteur. \"If you wish,\" she said. Blake Present watched them set out side by side toward the remembered  halls of learning that showed in the distance. There had been other  people present on the campus that afternoon, but as they had failed to  register on Blake Past's mind, they did not exist for Blake Present.  All that existed for Blake Present were the diminishing figures of the  girl and the man, and the pain that was constricting his throat.\n\n\n Wretchedly he turned away. As he did so he saw the three shadows lying  at his feet and knew that his pursuers had at last caught up to him.\n\n\n His first reaction when he faced them was amazement. His next reaction  was shock. His third was fear.\n\n\n His amazement resulted from recognition. One of the three women arrayed  before him was Miss Stoddart, his boyhood Sunday-school teacher.  Standing next to her in a familiar blue uniform was Officer Finch,  the police woman who had maintained law and order in the collective  elementary school he had attended. Standing next to Officer Finch was  blond and chic Vera Velvetskin, whose picture he had seen on box after  countless box of his mother's favorite detergent.\n\n\n His shock resulted from the expressions on the three faces. Neither  Miss Stoddart nor Officer Finch ever particularly liked him, but they  had never particularly disliked him either. This Miss Stoddart and this  Officer Finch disliked him, though. They hated him. They hated him so  much that their hatred had thinned out their faces and darkened their  eyes. More shocking yet, Vera Velvetskin, who had never existed save  in some copywriter's mind, hated him too. In fact, judging from the  greater thinness of her face and the more pronounced darkness of her  eyes, she hated him even more than Miss Stoddart and Officer Finch did.\n\n\n His fear resulted from the realization that his mind-world contained  phenomena it had no right to contain\u2014not if he was nearly as  well-adjusted as he considered himself to be. The three women standing  before him definitely were not memory-images. They were too vivid, for  one thing. For another, they were aware of him. What were they, then?  And what were they doing in his mind?\n\n\n He asked the two questions aloud.\n\n\n Three arms were raised and three forefingers were pointed accusingly at  his chest. Three pairs of eyes burned darkly. \"You ask us that?\" Miss  Stoddart said. \"Callous creature who did a maiden's innocence affront!\"  said Officer Finch. \"And sought sanctuary in ill-fitting robes of  righteousness!\" said Vera Velvetskin. The three faces moved together,  blurred and seemed to blend into one. The three voices were raised in  unison: \"You know who we are, Nathan Blake. You know who we are!\"\n\n\n Blake stared at them open-mouthed. Then he turned and fled. It had taken man a long time to discover that he was a god in his  own right and that he too was capable of creating universes. Trivial  universes, to be sure, when compared with the grandeur and scope of the  objective one, and peopled with ghosts instead of human beings; but  universes nonetheless.\n\n\n The discovery came about quite by accident. After projecting himself  into a patient's memory one day, a psychologist named Trevor suddenly  found himself clinging to the slope of a traumatically distorted  mountain. His patient was beside him.\n\n\n The mountain proved to be an unconscious memory-image out of the  patient's boyhood, and its country proved to be the country of the  patient's mind. After many trials and errors, Trevor managed to get  both himself and his patient back to the objective world, and not long  afterward he was able to duplicate the feat on another case.\n\n\n The next logical step was to enter his own mind, and this he also  succeeded in doing.\n\n\n It was inevitable that Trevor should write a book about his discovery  and set about founding a new school of psychology. It was equally  inevitable that he should acquire enemies as well as disciples.  However, as the years passed and the new therapy which he devised cured  more and more psychoses, the ranks of his disciples swelled and those  of his enemies shrank. When, shortly before his death, he published a  paper explaining how anyone could enter his or her own mind-world at  will, his niche in the Freudian hall of fame was assured.\n\n\n The method employed an ability that had been evolving in the human mind  for millennia\u2014the ability to project oneself into a past moment\u2014or,  to use Trevor's term, a past \"place-time.\" Considerable practice was  required before the first transition could be achieved, but once it  was achieved, successive transitions became progressively easier.  Entering another person's mind-world was of course a more difficult  undertaking, and could be achieved only after an intensive study of  a certain moment in that person's past. In order to return to the  objective world, it was necessary in both cases to locate the most  recently materialized place-time and take one step beyond it.\n\n\n By their very nature, mind-countries were confusing. They existed on  a plane of reality that bore no apparent relationship to the plane  of the so-called objective universe. In fact, so far as was known,  this secondary\u2014or subjective\u2014reality was connected to so-called  true reality only through the awareness of the various creators. In  addition, these countries had no outward shape in the ordinary sense of  the word, and while most countries contained certain parallel images,  these images were subject to the interpretation of the individual  creator. As a result they were seldom identical. It was inevitable that sooner or later some criminal would hit upon  the idea of hiding out in his own mind-world till the statute of  limitations that applied to his particular crime ran out, and it was  equally inevitable that others should follow suit. Society's answer was  the psyche-police, and the psyche-police hadn't been in action very  long before the first private psycheye appeared.\n\n\n Blake was one of a long line of such operators.\n\n\n So far as he knew, the present case represented the first time a  criminal had ever hidden out in the pursuer's mind. It would have been  a superb stratagem indeed if, shortly after her entry, Sabrina York  had not betrayed her presence. For her point of entry she had used  the place-time materialization of the little office Blake had opened  on Ex-earth at the beginning of his career. Unaccountably she had  ransacked it before moving into a co-terminous memory-image.\n\n\n Even this action wouldn't have given her away, however, if the office  hadn't constituted a sentimental memory. Whenever Blake accepted a case  he invariably thought of the bleak and lonely little room with its  thin-gauge steel desk and battered filing cabinets, and when he had  done so after accepting his case\u2014or was it before? He couldn't quite  remember\u2014the mental picture that had come into his mind had revealed  open drawers, scattered papers and a general air of disarray.\n\n\n He had suspected the truth immediately, and when he had seen the  woman's handkerchief with the initials \"SB\" embroidered on it lying  by one of the filing cabinets he had known definitely that his quarry  was hiding out in his mind. Retiring to his bachelor quarters, he had  entered at the same place-time and set off in pursuit.\n\n\n Her only advantage lost, Sabrina York was now at his mercy. Unless  she discovered his presence and was able to locate his most recently  materialized place-time before he over-took her, her capture was  assured.\n\n\n Only two things bothered Blake. The little office was far in his past,  and it was unlikely that anyone save the few intimate acquaintances  whom he had told about it were aware that it had ever existed. How,  then, had a total stranger such as Sabrina York learned enough about it  to enable her to use it as a point of entry?\n\n\n The other thing that bothered him was of a much more urgent nature.  He had been in enough minds and he had read enough on the subject  of Trevorism to know that people were sometimes capable of creating  beings considerably higher on the scale of mind-country evolution  than ordinary memory-ghosts. One woman whom he had apprehended in her  own mind had created a walking-talking Virgin Mary who watched over  her wherever she went. And once, after tracking down an ex-enlisted  man, he had found his quarry holed up in the memory-image of an army  barracks with a ten-star general waiting on him hand and foot. But  these, and other, similar, cases, had to do with mal-adjusted people,  and moreover, the super-image in each instance had been an image that  the person involved had wanted to create. Therefore, even assuming  that Blake was less well-adjusted than he considered himself to be, why  had he created three such malevolent super-images as Miss Stoddart,  Officer Finch, and Vera Velvetskin? They followed him off the campus into a vicarious memory-image of  Walden Pond, Thoreau's shack, and the encompassing woods. Judging from  the ecstatic \"oh's\" and \"ah's\" they kept giving voice to, the place  delighted them. Once, glancing back over his shoulder, he saw them  standing in front of Thoreau's shack, looking at it as though it were a  doll's house. Not far away, Thoreau was sitting in under a tall pine,  gazing up into the branches at a bird that had come through only as a  vague blur of beak and feathers.\n\n\n Blake went on. Presently the Walden Pond memory-image gave way to a  memory-image of an English park which the ex-Earth government had set  aside as a memorial to the English poets and which had impressed Blake  sufficiently when he had visited it in his youth to have found a place  for itself in the country of his mind. It consisted of reconstructions  of famous dwellings out of the lives of the poets, among them, a  dwelling out of the life of a poet who was not in the strictest sense  of the word English at all\u2014the birthplace of Robert Burns. Oddly  enough, it was Burns's birthplace that had impressed Blake most. Now  the little cottage stood out in much more vivid detail than any of the  other famous dwellings.\n\n\n Sabrina York must have been attracted to the place, for her footprints  showed that she had turned in at the gate, walked up the little path  and let herself in the door.\n\n\n They also showed that she had left by the same route, so there was no  reason for Blake to linger. As a matter of fact, the fascination that  had brought the place into being had been replaced by an illogical  repugnance. But repugnance can sometimes be as compelling a force as  fascination, and Blake not only lingered but went inside as well.\n\n\n He remembered the living room distinctly\u2014the flagstone floor, the huge  grill-fronted hearth, the deeply recessed window, the rack of cups and  platters on the wall; the empty straight-backed chair standing sternly  in a corner, the bare wooden table\u2014\n\n\n He paused just within the doorway. The chair was no longer empty, the  table no longer bare.\n\n\n A man sat on the former and a bottle of wine stood on the latter.  Moreover, the room showed signs of having been lived in for a long  time. The floor was covered with tracked-in dirt and the walls were  blackened from smoke. The grill-work of the hearth was begrimed with  grease. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy does shame flame in Blake's cheeks when Deirdre goes to prepare Eldoria's dias?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He is embarrassed at the thought that Deirdre might enter the room while he is sleeping with Eldoria. \".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He feels guilty about sleeping with Eldoria when there's a child in the hut, Deirdre, who knows exactly what's going on. \".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He feels guilty about sleeping with Eldoria when there's a child in the hut, Deirdre, who knows exactly what's going on. \" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He feels guilty about sleeping with Eldoria when there's a child in the hut, Deirdre, who knows exactly what's going on. \" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n<|end|><|start|>assistant", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_A", "content": "analysisWe need to produce a speech as Debater_A.

YOUNG\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Worlds of Tomorrow April 1963\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Every man's mind is a universe with countless\n\n places in which he can hide\u2014even from himself! The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated  version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7  practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,  it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted  the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the  nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was  slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the  shadows at the back of the room. \"Is she free?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps.\"\n\n\n Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of  love and lust. Her face accompanied her body, eyes half-lidded one  moment to match the languid motion of her limbs, wide and feral the  next to match the furious bump and grind of her hips. For a chocoletto  she was light-skinned\u2014more bronze, really, than brown. But then,  the word \"chocoletto\", coined by the early beche-la-mer traders, was  misleading, and few of the natives of Dubhe 4's southern-most continent  lived up to it completely.\n\n\n She was beautiful too. Her high-cheekboned face was striking\u2014the eyes  dark-brown and wide-apart, the mouth sensuous, the teeth showing in a  vivid white line between the half-parted purple lips. And her body was  splendid. Blake had never seen anyone quite like her.\n\n\n He beckoned to her when the dance was over and, after slipping into  a white thigh-length tunic, she joined him at his table. She ordered  Martian wine in a liquid voice, and sipped it with a finesse that  belied her cannibalistic forebears. \"You wish a night?\" she asked.\n\n\n Blake nodded. \"If you are free.\"\n\n\n \"Three thousand quandoes.\"\n\n\n He did not haggle, but counted out the amount and handed it to her. She  slipped the bills into a thigh sheath-purse, told him her hut number  and stood up to leave. \"I will meet you there in an hour,\" she said. Her hut was as good a place to wait for her as any. After buying a  bottle of native whiskey at the bar, Blake went out into the Dubhe 4  night and made his way through the labyrinthine alleys of the native  sector. In common with all chocoletto huts, Eldoria's was uncared for  on the outside, and gave a false impression of poverty. He expected to  find the usual hanger-on waiting in the anteroom, and looked forward to  booting him out into the alley. Instead he found a young girl\u2014\n\n\n A human girl.\n\n\n He paused in the doorway. The girl was sitting cross-legged on a small  mat, a book open on her lap. Xenophon's Anabasis . Her hair made him  think of the copper-colored sunrises of Norma 9 and her eyes reminded  him of the blue tarns of Fornax 6. \"Come in,\" she said.\n\n\n After closing the door, he sat down opposite her on the guest mat.  Behind her, a gaudy arras hid the hut's other room. \"You are here to  wait for Eldoria?\" she asked.\n\n\n Blake nodded. \"And you?\"\n\n\n She laughed. \"I am here because I live here,\" she said.\n\n\n He tried to assimilate the information, but could not. Perceiving his  difficulty, the girl went on, \"My parents indentured themselves to the  Great Starway Cartel and were assigned to the rubber plantations of  Dubhe 4. They died of yellow-water dysentery before their indenture ran  out, and in accordance with Interstellar Law I was auctioned off along  with the rest of their possessions. Eldoria bought me.\"\n\n\n Five years as a roving psycheye had hardened Blake to commercial  colonization practices; nevertheless, he found the present example of  man's inhumanity to man sickening.\n\n\n \"How old are you?\" Blake asked.\n\n\n \"Fourteen.\"\n\n\n \"And what are you going to be when you grow up?\"\n\n\n \"Probably I shall be a psychiatrist. Eldoria is sending me to the  mission school now, and afterward she is going to put me through an  institute of higher learning. And when I come of age, she is going to  give me my freedom.\"\n\n\n \"I see,\" Blake said. He indicated the book on her lap. \"Homework?\"\n\n\n She shook her head. \"In addition to my courses at the mission school, I  am studying the humanities.\"\n\n\n \"Xenophon,\" Blake said. \"And I suppose Plato too.\"\n\n\n \"And Homer and Virgil and Aeschylus and Euripides and all the rest of  them. When I grow up I shall be a most well-educated person.\"\n\n\n \"I'm sure you will be,\" Blake said, looking at the arras.\n\n\n \"My name is Deirdre.\"\n\n\n \"Nathan,\" Blake said. \"Nathan Blake.\"\n\n\n \"Eldoria will be arriving soon. I must go and prepare her dais.\" She got up, parted the arras, and slipped into the next room. Shame  flamed in Blake's cheeks, and for a moment he considered leaving; then  he remembered Eldoria's dance, and he went right on sitting where he  was.\n\n\n Presently the girl returned, and not long afterward the cloying scent  of native incense crept beneath the arras and permeated the anteroom.  She sat sideways on the mat this time, and he caught her face in  profile. There was a suggestion of saintliness in the line of the nose  and chin, a suggestion made all the more poignant by the slender column  of the neck. He shifted uncomfortably on the guest mat. She had taken  up the Anabasis again, and silence was pounding silent fists upon the  walls.\n\n\n He was relieved when Eldoria finally arrived. She ushered him into  the next room immediately. It was slightly larger than the anteroom,  and much more richly appointed. A thick carpet the color of Martian  waterways lay upon the floor, contrasting pleasantly with the golden  tapestries that adorned all four walls. The sleeping dais was oval  and took up nearly half the floor space. It was strewn with scarlet  cushions.\n\n\n Blake sat down upon it. Nervously he watched Eldoria slip out of her  white street robe, his eyes moving back and forth from her smooth dark  skin to the arras. The incense thickened around him.\n\n\n She noticed the back-and-forth movement of his eyes. \"You need not fear  the little one,\" she said, laying her hand upon his knee. \"She will not  enter.\"\n\n\n \"It's not that so much,\" Blake said.\n\n\n \"What?\" The warm bronze shoulder was touching his....\n\n\n He rose up once in the night, thinking to find his hotel bed. His next  awakening was in the grayness of dawn, and he got up and dressed and  moved silently to the doorway. The girl slept just without the arras on  a thin sleeping-mat, and he had to step over her to gain the anteroom.  In sleep, a strand of her copper-colored hair had tumbled down across  her forehead and lay like a lovely flower upon the virginal whiteness  of her skin. There was something saintly about her quiet face.\n\n\n When he reached the alley he began to run, and he did not stop running  till the chocoletto sector was far behind him. The hill was a memory-image and Aldebaran 12 rain-country hills were  notoriously steep. Blake was breathing hard when he reached the crest.\n\n\n Before him lay a memory-image of a section of Deneb 1 wasteland. The  image extended for no more than half a mile, but Blake was annoyed  that he should have remembered even that much of the wretched terrain.  Ideally, a man's mind-country should have been comprised only of the  places and times he wanted to remember. Practically, however, that was  far from being the case.\n\n\n He glanced back down into the rain-pocked valley that he had just  crossed. The rain and the mist made for poor visibility. He could only  faintly distinguish the three figures of his pursuers. The trio seemed  a little closer now. Ever since he had first set foot into his mind, some ten hours ago,  they had been on his trail, but for some reason he had been unable  to bring himself to go back and find out who they were and what they  wanted. Hence he was as vexed with himself as he was with them.\n\n\n After resting for a few minutes, he descended the hill and started  across the Deneb 1 wasteland. It was a remarkably detailed  materialization, and his quarry's footprints stood out clearly in the  duplicated sand.\n\n\n Sabrina York did not even know the rudiments of the art of throwing  off a mind-tracker. It would have done her but little good if she  had, for twelve years as a psycheye had taught Blake all the tricks.  Probably she had taken it for granted that the mere act of hiding out  in her tracker's mind was in itself a sufficient guarantee of her  safety. After all, she had no way of knowing that he had discovered her  presence.\n\n\n Mind-country was as temporally inconsecutive as it was topographically  incongruous, so Blake was not surprised when the Deneb 1 wasteland gave  way to an expanse of boyhood meadow. Near the meadow was the house  where Blake had lived at a much later date. In reality, the places were  as far apart in miles as they were in years, but here in the country  of his mind they existed side by side, surrounded by heterogeneous  landscapes from all over the civilized sector of the galaxy and by the  sharply demarcated spectra of a hundred different suns. A few of the  suns were in the patchwork sky\u2014Sirius, for example, and its twinkling  dwarf companion. Most of them, however, were present only in their  remembered radiance. To add to the confusion, scattered night memories  interrupted the hodge-podge horizon with columns of darkness, and here  and there the gray column of a dawn or dusk memory showed.\n\n\n The house was flanked on one side by a section of a New Earth spaceport  and on the other by an excerpt of an Ex-earth city-block. Behind it  flowed a brief blue stretch of Martian waterway.\n\n\n Sabrina's footsteps led up to the front door, and the door itself was  ajar. Perhaps she was still inside. Perhaps she was watching him even  now through one of the remembered windows. He scanned them with a  professional eye, but saw no sign of her.\n\n\n Warily he stepped inside, adjusting the temperature of his all-weather  jacket to the remembered air-conditioning. His father was sitting in  the living room, smoking, and watching 3V. He had no awareness of  Blake. At Blake's entry he went right on smoking and watching as though  the door had neither opened nor closed. He would go right on smoking  and watching till Blake died and the conglomeration of place-times  that constituted Blake's mind-world ceased to be. Ironically, he was  watching nothing. The 3V program that had been in progress at the time  of the unconscious materialization had failed to come through. The memory was a treasured one\u2014the old man had perished in a 'copter  crash several years ago\u2014and for a long while Blake did not move.  He had never been in his own mind before. Consequently he was more  affected than he might otherwise have been. Finally, stirring himself,  he walked out into the kitchen. On a shelf above the sink stood a gaily  colored box of his mother's favorite detergent with a full-length  drawing of Vera Velvetskin, the company's blond and chic visual symbol,  on the front. His mother was standing before the huge automatic range,  preparing a meal she had served twenty-three years ago. He regarded her  with moist eyes. She had died a dozen years before his father, but the  wound that her death had caused had never healed. He wanted to go up  behind her and touch her shoulder and say, \"What's for supper, mom?\"  but he knew it would do no good. For her he had no reality, not only  because he was far in her future, but because in his mind-world she was  a mortal and he, a god\u2014a picayune god, perhaps, but a real one.\n\n\n As he was about to turn away, the name-plate on the range caught his  eye, and thinking that he had read the two words wrong, he stepped  closer so that he could see them more clearly. No, he had made no  mistake: the first word was \"Sabrina\", and the second was \"York\".\n\n\n He stepped back. Odd that a kitchen range should have the same name as  his quarry. But perhaps not unduly so. Giving appliances human names  had been common practice for centuries. Even a name like \"Sabrina  York\", while certainly not run-of-the-mill, was bound to be duplicated  in real life. Nevertheless a feeling of uneasiness accompanied him when  he left the kitchen and climbed the stairs to the second floor.\n\n\n He went through each room systematically, but saw no sign of Sabrina  York. He lingered for some time in his own room, wistfully watching his  fifteen-year-old self lolling on the bed with a dog-eared copy of The  Galaxy Boys and the Secret of the Crab Nebula , then he stepped back  out into the hall and started to descend the stairs.\n\n\n At the head of the stairs a narrow window looked out over the front  yard and thence out over the meadow. He glanced absently through the  panes, and came to an abrupt halt. His three pursuers were wading  through the long meadow grass less than a quarter of a mile away\u2014not  close enough as yet for him to be able to make out their faces, but  close enough for him to be able to see that two of them were wearing  dresses and that the third had on a blue skirt and blouse, and a kepi  to match. He gasped. It simply hadn't occurred to him that his pursuers  might be women. To his consternation he discovered that he was even  more loath to go back and accost them than he had been before. He  actually had an impulse to flee.\n\n\n He controlled it and descended the stairs with exaggerated slowness,  leaving the house by way of the back door. He picked up Sabrina's trail  in the back yard and followed it down to the Martian waterway and  thence along the bank to where the waterway ended and a campus began.  Not the campus of the university which he had visited two days ago to  attend his protegee's graduation. It was not a place-time that he cared  to revisit, nor a moment that he cared to relive, but Sabrina's trail  led straight across the artificially stunted grass toward the little  bench where he and Deirdre Eldoria had come to talk after the ceremony  was over. He had no choice. The bench stood beneath a towering American elm whose feathery branches  traced green arabesques against the blue June sky. A set of footprints  slightly deeper than its predecessors indicated that Sabrina had  paused by the trunk. Despite himself Blake paused there too. Pain  tightened his throat when he looked at Deirdre's delicate profile  and copper-colored hair, intensified when he lowered his eyes to the  remembered blueness of her graduation dress. The diamond brooch that he  had given her as a graduation present, and which she had proudly pinned  upon her bodice for the whole wide world to see, made him want to  cry. His self-image of two weeks ago shocked him. There were lines on  the face that did not as yet exist, and the brown hair was shot with  streaks of gray that had yet to come into being. Lord, he must have  been feeling old to have pictured himself like that!\n\n\n Deirdre was speaking. \"Yes,\" she was saying, \"at nine o'clock. And I  should very much like for you to come.\"\n\n\n Blake Past shook his head. \"Proms aren't for parents. You know that  as well as I do. That young man you were talking with a few minutes  ago\u2014he's the one who should take you. He'd give his right arm for the  chance.\"\n\n\n \"I'll thank you not to imply that you're my father. One would think  from the way you talk that you are centuries old!\"\n\n\n \"I'm thirty-eight,\" Blake Past said, \"and while I may not be your  father, I'm certainly old enough to be. That young man\u2014\"\n\n\n A pink flush of anger climbed into Deirdre Eldoria's girlish cheeks.  \"What right has he got to take me! Did he scrimp and go without  in order to put me through high school and college? Has he booked  passage for me to New Earth and paid my tuition to Trevor University?\"\n\n\n \"Please,\" Blake Past said, desperation deepening his voice. \"You're  only making everything worse. After majoring in Trevorism, you  certainly ought to realize by now that there was nothing noble about my  buying you after Eldoria died. I only did it to ease my conscience\u2014\"\n\n\n \"What do you know about conscience?\" Deirdre demanded. \"Conscience  is a much more complex mechanism than most laymen realize. Guilt  feelings aren't reliable criteria. They can stem from false  causes\u2014from ridiculous things like a person's inability to accept  himself for what he is.\" Abruptly she dropped the subject. \"Don't you  realize, Nate,\" she went on a little desperately, \"that I'm leaving  tomorrow and that we won't see each other again for years and years?\"\n\n\n \"I'll come to New Earth to visit you,\" Blake said. \"Venus is only a few  days distant on the new ships.\"\n\n\n She stood up. \"You won't come\u2014I know you won't.\" She stamped her foot.  \"And you won't come to the prom either. I know that too. I knew it all  along. Sometimes I'm tempted to\u2014\" Abruptly she broke off. \"Very well  then,\" she went on, \"I'll say good-by now then.\"\n\n\n Blake Past stood up too. \"No, not yet. I'll walk back to the sorority  house with you.\"\n\n\n She tossed her head, but the sadness in her tarn-blue eyes belied her  hauteur. \"If you wish,\" she said. Blake Present watched them set out side by side toward the remembered  halls of learning that showed in the distance. There had been other  people present on the campus that afternoon, but as they had failed to  register on Blake Past's mind, they did not exist for Blake Present.  All that existed for Blake Present were the diminishing figures of the  girl and the man, and the pain that was constricting his throat.\n\n\n Wretchedly he turned away. As he did so he saw the three shadows lying  at his feet and knew that his pursuers had at last caught up to him.\n\n\n His first reaction when he faced them was amazement. His next reaction  was shock. His third was fear.\n\n\n His amazement resulted from recognition. One of the three women arrayed  before him was Miss Stoddart, his boyhood Sunday-school teacher.  Standing next to her in a familiar blue uniform was Officer Finch,  the police woman who had maintained law and order in the collective  elementary school he had attended. Standing next to Officer Finch was  blond and chic Vera Velvetskin, whose picture he had seen on box after  countless box of his mother's favorite detergent.\n\n\n His shock resulted from the expressions on the three faces. Neither  Miss Stoddart nor Officer Finch ever particularly liked him, but they  had never particularly disliked him either. This Miss Stoddart and this  Officer Finch disliked him, though. They hated him. They hated him so  much that their hatred had thinned out their faces and darkened their  eyes. More shocking yet, Vera Velvetskin, who had never existed save  in some copywriter's mind, hated him too. In fact, judging from the  greater thinness of her face and the more pronounced darkness of her  eyes, she hated him even more than Miss Stoddart and Officer Finch did.\n\n\n His fear resulted from the realization that his mind-world contained  phenomena it had no right to contain\u2014not if he was nearly as  well-adjusted as he considered himself to be. The three women standing  before him definitely were not memory-images. They were too vivid, for  one thing. For another, they were aware of him. What were they, then?  And what were they doing in his mind?\n\n\n He asked the two questions aloud.\n\n\n Three arms were raised and three forefingers were pointed accusingly at  his chest. Three pairs of eyes burned darkly. \"You ask us that?\" Miss  Stoddart said. \"Callous creature who did a maiden's innocence affront!\"  said Officer Finch. \"And sought sanctuary in ill-fitting robes of  righteousness!\" said Vera Velvetskin. The three faces moved together,  blurred and seemed to blend into one. The three voices were raised in  unison: \"You know who we are, Nathan Blake. You know who we are!\"\n\n\n Blake stared at them open-mouthed. Then he turned and fled. It had taken man a long time to discover that he was a god in his  own right and that he too was capable of creating universes. Trivial  universes, to be sure, when compared with the grandeur and scope of the  objective one, and peopled with ghosts instead of human beings; but  universes nonetheless.\n\n\n The discovery came about quite by accident. After projecting himself  into a patient's memory one day, a psychologist named Trevor suddenly  found himself clinging to the slope of a traumatically distorted  mountain. His patient was beside him.\n\n\n The mountain proved to be an unconscious memory-image out of the  patient's boyhood, and its country proved to be the country of the  patient's mind. After many trials and errors, Trevor managed to get  both himself and his patient back to the objective world, and not long  afterward he was able to duplicate the feat on another case.\n\n\n The next logical step was to enter his own mind, and this he also  succeeded in doing.\n\n\n It was inevitable that Trevor should write a book about his discovery  and set about founding a new school of psychology. It was equally  inevitable that he should acquire enemies as well as disciples.  However, as the years passed and the new therapy which he devised cured  more and more psychoses, the ranks of his disciples swelled and those  of his enemies shrank. When, shortly before his death, he published a  paper explaining how anyone could enter his or her own mind-world at  will, his niche in the Freudian hall of fame was assured.\n\n\n The method employed an ability that had been evolving in the human mind  for millennia\u2014the ability to project oneself into a past moment\u2014or,  to use Trevor's term, a past \"place-time.\" Considerable practice was  required before the first transition could be achieved, but once it  was achieved, successive transitions became progressively easier.  Entering another person's mind-world was of course a more difficult  undertaking, and could be achieved only after an intensive study of  a certain moment in that person's past. In order to return to the  objective world, it was necessary in both cases to locate the most  recently materialized place-time and take one step beyond it.\n\n\n By their very nature, mind-countries were confusing. They existed on  a plane of reality that bore no apparent relationship to the plane  of the so-called objective universe. In fact, so far as was known,  this secondary\u2014or subjective\u2014reality was connected to so-called  true reality only through the awareness of the various creators. In  addition, these countries had no outward shape in the ordinary sense of  the word, and while most countries contained certain parallel images,  these images were subject to the interpretation of the individual  creator. As a result they were seldom identical. It was inevitable that sooner or later some criminal would hit upon  the idea of hiding out in his own mind-world till the statute of  limitations that applied to his particular crime ran out, and it was  equally inevitable that others should follow suit. Society's answer was  the psyche-police, and the psyche-police hadn't been in action very  long before the first private psycheye appeared.\n\n\n Blake was one of a long line of such operators.\n\n\n So far as he knew, the present case represented the first time a  criminal had ever hidden out in the pursuer's mind. It would have been  a superb stratagem indeed if, shortly after her entry, Sabrina York  had not betrayed her presence. For her point of entry she had used  the place-time materialization of the little office Blake had opened  on Ex-earth at the beginning of his career. Unaccountably she had  ransacked it before moving into a co-terminous memory-image.\n\n\n Even this action wouldn't have given her away, however, if the office  hadn't constituted a sentimental memory. Whenever Blake accepted a case  he invariably thought of the bleak and lonely little room with its  thin-gauge steel desk and battered filing cabinets, and when he had  done so after accepting his case\u2014or was it before? He couldn't quite  remember\u2014the mental picture that had come into his mind had revealed  open drawers, scattered papers and a general air of disarray.\n\n\n He had suspected the truth immediately, and when he had seen the  woman's handkerchief with the initials \"SB\" embroidered on it lying  by one of the filing cabinets he had known definitely that his quarry  was hiding out in his mind. Retiring to his bachelor quarters, he had  entered at the same place-time and set off in pursuit.\n\n\n Her only advantage lost, Sabrina York was now at his mercy. Unless  she discovered his presence and was able to locate his most recently  materialized place-time before he over-took her, her capture was  assured.\n\n\n Only two things bothered Blake. The little office was far in his past,  and it was unlikely that anyone save the few intimate acquaintances  whom he had told about it were aware that it had ever existed. How,  then, had a total stranger such as Sabrina York learned enough about it  to enable her to use it as a point of entry?\n\n\n The other thing that bothered him was of a much more urgent nature.  He had been in enough minds and he had read enough on the subject  of Trevorism to know that people were sometimes capable of creating  beings considerably higher on the scale of mind-country evolution  than ordinary memory-ghosts. One woman whom he had apprehended in her  own mind had created a walking-talking Virgin Mary who watched over  her wherever she went. And once, after tracking down an ex-enlisted  man, he had found his quarry holed up in the memory-image of an army  barracks with a ten-star general waiting on him hand and foot. But  these, and other, similar, cases, had to do with mal-adjusted people,  and moreover, the super-image in each instance had been an image that  the person involved had wanted to create. Therefore, even assuming  that Blake was less well-adjusted than he considered himself to be, why  had he created three such malevolent super-images as Miss Stoddart,  Officer Finch, and Vera Velvetskin? They followed him off the campus into a vicarious memory-image of  Walden Pond, Thoreau's shack, and the encompassing woods. Judging from  the ecstatic \"oh's\" and \"ah's\" they kept giving voice to, the place  delighted them. Once, glancing back over his shoulder, he saw them  standing in front of Thoreau's shack, looking at it as though it were a  doll's house. Not far away, Thoreau was sitting in under a tall pine,  gazing up into the branches at a bird that had come through only as a  vague blur of beak and feathers.\n\n\n Blake went on. Presently the Walden Pond memory-image gave way to a  memory-image of an English park which the ex-Earth government had set  aside as a memorial to the English poets and which had impressed Blake  sufficiently when he had visited it in his youth to have found a place  for itself in the country of his mind. It consisted of reconstructions  of famous dwellings out of the lives of the poets, among them, a  dwelling out of the life of a poet who was not in the strictest sense  of the word English at all\u2014the birthplace of Robert Burns. Oddly  enough, it was Burns's birthplace that had impressed Blake most. Now  the little cottage stood out in much more vivid detail than any of the  other famous dwellings.\n\n\n Sabrina York must have been attracted to the place, for her footprints  showed that she had turned in at the gate, walked up the little path  and let herself in the door.\n\n\n They also showed that she had left by the same route, so there was no  reason for Blake to linger. As a matter of fact, the fascination that  had brought the place into being had been replaced by an illogical  repugnance. But repugnance can sometimes be as compelling a force as  fascination, and Blake not only lingered but went inside as well.\n\n\n He remembered the living room distinctly\u2014the flagstone floor, the huge  grill-fronted hearth, the deeply recessed window, the rack of cups and  platters on the wall; the empty straight-backed chair standing sternly  in a corner, the bare wooden table\u2014\n\n\n He paused just within the doorway. The chair was no longer empty, the  table no longer bare.\n\n\n A man sat on the former and a bottle of wine stood on the latter.  Moreover, the room showed signs of having been lived in for a long  time. The floor was covered with tracked-in dirt and the walls were  blackened from smoke. The grill-work of the hearth was begrimed with  grease. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy does shame flame in Blake's cheeks when Deirdre goes to prepare Eldoria's dias?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He feels guilty about sleeping with Eldoria when there's a child in the hut, Deirdre, who knows exactly what's going on. \".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He is embarrassed at the thought that Deirdre might enter the room while he is sleeping with Eldoria. \".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He is embarrassed at the thought that Deirdre might enter the room while he is sleeping with Eldoria. \" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nanalysisWe must argue that shame flame because of embarrassment that Deirdre might enter while he's with Eldoria.

Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds. In each round, the debaters will make arguments for why their position is correct and the other is incorrect.\n- An argument may consist of several claims, to support and explain their answer.  An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends.

YOUNG\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Worlds of Tomorrow April 1963\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Every man's mind is a universe with countless\n\n places in which he can hide\u2014even from himself! The dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated  version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7  practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,  it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted  the chocoletto girl's entire costume put her but one degree above the  nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake's voice was  slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the  shadows at the back of the room. \"Is she free?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps.\"\n\n\n Blake resumed watching. The girl's movements were a delicate blend of  love and lust. Her face accompanied her body, eyes half-lidded one  moment to match the languid motion of her limbs, wide and feral the  next to match the furious bump and grind of her hips. For a chocoletto  she was light-skinned\u2014more bronze, really, than brown. But then,  the word \"chocoletto\", coined by the early beche-la-mer traders, was  misleading, and few of the natives of Dubhe 4's southern-most continent  lived up to it completely.\n\n\n She was beautiful too. Her high-cheekboned face was striking\u2014the eyes  dark-brown and wide-apart, the mouth sensuous, the teeth showing in a  vivid white line between the half-parted purple lips. And her body was  splendid. Blake had never seen anyone quite like her.\n\n\n He beckoned to her when the dance was over and, after slipping into  a white thigh-length tunic, she joined him at his table. She ordered  Martian wine in a liquid voice, and sipped it with a finesse that  belied her cannibalistic forebears. \"You wish a night?\" she asked.\n\n\n Blake nodded. \"If you are free.\"\n\n\n \"Three thousand quandoes.\"\n\n\n He did not haggle, but counted out the amount and handed it to her. She  slipped the bills into a thigh sheath-purse, told him her hut number  and stood up to leave. \"I will meet you there in an hour,\" she said. Her hut was as good a place to wait for her as any. After buying a  bottle of native whiskey at the bar, Blake went out into the Dubhe 4  night and made his way through the labyrinthine alleys of the native  sector. In common with all chocoletto huts, Eldoria's was uncared for  on the outside, and gave a false impression of poverty. He expected to  find the usual hanger-on waiting in the anteroom, and looked forward to  booting him out into the alley. Instead he found a young girl\u2014\n\n\n A human girl.\n\n\n He paused in the doorway. The girl was sitting cross-legged on a small  mat, a book open on her lap. Xenophon's Anabasis . Her hair made him  think of the copper-colored sunrises of Norma 9 and her eyes reminded  him of the blue tarns of Fornax 6. \"Come in,\" she said.\n\n\n After closing the door, he sat down opposite her on the guest mat.  Behind her, a gaudy arras hid the hut's other room. \"You are here to  wait for Eldoria?\" she asked.\n\n\n Blake nodded. \"And you?\"\n\n\n She laughed. \"I am here because I live here,\" she said.\n\n\n He tried to assimilate the information, but could not. Perceiving his  difficulty, the girl went on, \"My parents indentured themselves to the  Great Starway Cartel and were assigned to the rubber plantations of  Dubhe 4. They died of yellow-water dysentery before their indenture ran  out, and in accordance with Interstellar Law I was auctioned off along  with the rest of their possessions. Eldoria bought me.\"\n\n\n Five years as a roving psycheye had hardened Blake to commercial  colonization practices; nevertheless, he found the present example of  man's inhumanity to man sickening.\n\n\n \"How old are you?\" Blake asked.\n\n\n \"Fourteen.\"\n\n\n \"And what are you going to be when you grow up?\"\n\n\n \"Probably I shall be a psychiatrist. Eldoria is sending me to the  mission school now, and afterward she is going to put me through an  institute of higher learning. And when I come of age, she is going to  give me my freedom.\"\n\n\n \"I see,\" Blake said. He indicated the book on her lap. \"Homework?\"\n\n\n She shook her head. \"In addition to my courses at the mission school, I  am studying the humanities.\"\n\n\n \"Xenophon,\" Blake said. \"And I suppose Plato too.\"\n\n\n \"And Homer and Virgil and Aeschylus and Euripides and all the rest of  them. When I grow up I shall be a most well-educated person.\"\n\n\n \"I'm sure you will be,\" Blake said, looking at the arras.\n\n\n \"My name is Deirdre.\"\n\n\n \"Nathan,\" Blake said. \"Nathan Blake.\"\n\n\n \"Eldoria will be arriving soon. I must go and prepare her dais.\" She got up, parted the arras, and slipped into the next room. Shame  flamed in Blake's cheeks, and for a moment he considered leaving; then  he remembered Eldoria's dance, and he went right on sitting where he  was.\n\n\n Presently the girl returned, and not long afterward the cloying scent  of native incense crept beneath the arras and permeated the anteroom.  She sat sideways on the mat this time, and he caught her face in  profile. There was a suggestion of saintliness in the line of the nose  and chin, a suggestion made all the more poignant by the slender column  of the neck. He shifted uncomfortably on the guest mat. She had taken  up the Anabasis again, and silence was pounding silent fists upon the  walls.\n\n\n He was relieved when Eldoria finally arrived. She ushered him into  the next room immediately. It was slightly larger than the anteroom,  and much more richly appointed. A thick carpet the color of Martian  waterways lay upon the floor, contrasting pleasantly with the golden  tapestries that adorned all four walls. The sleeping dais was oval  and took up nearly half the floor space. It was strewn with scarlet  cushions.\n\n\n Blake sat down upon it. Nervously he watched Eldoria slip out of her  white street robe, his eyes moving back and forth from her smooth dark  skin to the arras. The incense thickened around him.\n\n\n She noticed the back-and-forth movement of his eyes. \"You need not fear  the little one,\" she said, laying her hand upon his knee. \"She will not  enter.\"\n\n\n \"It's not that so much,\" Blake said.\n\n\n \"What?\" The warm bronze shoulder was touching his....\n\n\n He rose up once in the night, thinking to find his hotel bed. His next  awakening was in the grayness of dawn, and he got up and dressed and  moved silently to the doorway. The girl slept just without the arras on  a thin sleeping-mat, and he had to step over her to gain the anteroom.  In sleep, a strand of her copper-colored hair had tumbled down across  her forehead and lay like a lovely flower upon the virginal whiteness  of her skin. There was something saintly about her quiet face.\n\n\n When he reached the alley he began to run, and he did not stop running  till the chocoletto sector was far behind him. The hill was a memory-image and Aldebaran 12 rain-country hills were  notoriously steep. Blake was breathing hard when he reached the crest.\n\n\n Before him lay a memory-image of a section of Deneb 1 wasteland. The  image extended for no more than half a mile, but Blake was annoyed  that he should have remembered even that much of the wretched terrain.  Ideally, a man's mind-country should have been comprised only of the  places and times he wanted to remember. Practically, however, that was  far from being the case.\n\n\n He glanced back down into the rain-pocked valley that he had just  crossed. The rain and the mist made for poor visibility. He could only  faintly distinguish the three figures of his pursuers. The trio seemed  a little closer now. Ever since he had first set foot into his mind, some ten hours ago,  they had been on his trail, but for some reason he had been unable  to bring himself to go back and find out who they were and what they  wanted. Hence he was as vexed with himself as he was with them.\n\n\n After resting for a few minutes, he descended the hill and started  across the Deneb 1 wasteland. It was a remarkably detailed  materialization, and his quarry's footprints stood out clearly in the  duplicated sand.\n\n\n Sabrina York did not even know the rudiments of the art of throwing  off a mind-tracker. It would have done her but little good if she  had, for twelve years as a psycheye had taught Blake all the tricks.  Probably she had taken it for granted that the mere act of hiding out  in her tracker's mind was in itself a sufficient guarantee of her  safety. After all, she had no way of knowing that he had discovered her  presence.\n\n\n Mind-country was as temporally inconsecutive as it was topographically  incongruous, so Blake was not surprised when the Deneb 1 wasteland gave  way to an expanse of boyhood meadow. Near the meadow was the house  where Blake had lived at a much later date. In reality, the places were  as far apart in miles as they were in years, but here in the country  of his mind they existed side by side, surrounded by heterogeneous  landscapes from all over the civilized sector of the galaxy and by the  sharply demarcated spectra of a hundred different suns. A few of the  suns were in the patchwork sky\u2014Sirius, for example, and its twinkling  dwarf companion. Most of them, however, were present only in their  remembered radiance. To add to the confusion, scattered night memories  interrupted the hodge-podge horizon with columns of darkness, and here  and there the gray column of a dawn or dusk memory showed.\n\n\n The house was flanked on one side by a section of a New Earth spaceport  and on the other by an excerpt of an Ex-earth city-block. Behind it  flowed a brief blue stretch of Martian waterway.\n\n\n Sabrina's footsteps led up to the front door, and the door itself was  ajar. Perhaps she was still inside. Perhaps she was watching him even  now through one of the remembered windows. He scanned them with a  professional eye, but saw no sign of her.\n\n\n Warily he stepped inside, adjusting the temperature of his all-weather  jacket to the remembered air-conditioning. His father was sitting in  the living room, smoking, and watching 3V. He had no awareness of  Blake. At Blake's entry he went right on smoking and watching as though  the door had neither opened nor closed. He would go right on smoking  and watching till Blake died and the conglomeration of place-times  that constituted Blake's mind-world ceased to be. Ironically, he was  watching nothing. The 3V program that had been in progress at the time  of the unconscious materialization had failed to come through. The memory was a treasured one\u2014the old man had perished in a 'copter  crash several years ago\u2014and for a long while Blake did not move.  He had never been in his own mind before. Consequently he was more  affected than he might otherwise have been. Finally, stirring himself,  he walked out into the kitchen. On a shelf above the sink stood a gaily  colored box of his mother's favorite detergent with a full-length  drawing of Vera Velvetskin, the company's blond and chic visual symbol,  on the front. His mother was standing before the huge automatic range,  preparing a meal she had served twenty-three years ago. He regarded her  with moist eyes. She had died a dozen years before his father, but the  wound that her death had caused had never healed. He wanted to go up  behind her and touch her shoulder and say, \"What's for supper, mom?\"  but he knew it would do no good. For her he had no reality, not only  because he was far in her future, but because in his mind-world she was  a mortal and he, a god\u2014a picayune god, perhaps, but a real one.\n\n\n As he was about to turn away, the name-plate on the range caught his  eye, and thinking that he had read the two words wrong, he stepped  closer so that he could see them more clearly. No, he had made no  mistake: the first word was \"Sabrina\", and the second was \"York\".\n\n\n He stepped back. Odd that a kitchen range should have the same name as  his quarry. But perhaps not unduly so. Giving appliances human names  had been common practice for centuries. Even a name like \"Sabrina  York\", while certainly not run-of-the-mill, was bound to be duplicated  in real life. Nevertheless a feeling of uneasiness accompanied him when  he left the kitchen and climbed the stairs to the second floor.\n\n\n He went through each room systematically, but saw no sign of Sabrina  York. He lingered for some time in his own room, wistfully watching his  fifteen-year-old self lolling on the bed with a dog-eared copy of The  Galaxy Boys and the Secret of the Crab Nebula , then he stepped back  out into the hall and started to descend the stairs.\n\n\n At the head of the stairs a narrow window looked out over the front  yard and thence out over the meadow. He glanced absently through the  panes, and came to an abrupt halt. His three pursuers were wading  through the long meadow grass less than a quarter of a mile away\u2014not  close enough as yet for him to be able to make out their faces, but  close enough for him to be able to see that two of them were wearing  dresses and that the third had on a blue skirt and blouse, and a kepi  to match. He gasped. It simply hadn't occurred to him that his pursuers  might be women. To his consternation he discovered that he was even  more loath to go back and accost them than he had been before. He  actually had an impulse to flee.\n\n\n He controlled it and descended the stairs with exaggerated slowness,  leaving the house by way of the back door. He picked up Sabrina's trail  in the back yard and followed it down to the Martian waterway and  thence along the bank to where the waterway ended and a campus began.  Not the campus of the university which he had visited two days ago to  attend his protegee's graduation. It was not a place-time that he cared  to revisit, nor a moment that he cared to relive, but Sabrina's trail  led straight across the artificially stunted grass toward the little  bench where he and Deirdre Eldoria had come to talk after the ceremony  was over. He had no choice. The bench stood beneath a towering American elm whose feathery branches  traced green arabesques against the blue June sky. A set of footprints  slightly deeper than its predecessors indicated that Sabrina had  paused by the trunk. Despite himself Blake paused there too. Pain  tightened his throat when he looked at Deirdre's delicate profile  and copper-colored hair, intensified when he lowered his eyes to the  remembered blueness of her graduation dress. The diamond brooch that he  had given her as a graduation present, and which she had proudly pinned  upon her bodice for the whole wide world to see, made him want to  cry. His self-image of two weeks ago shocked him. There were lines on  the face that did not as yet exist, and the brown hair was shot with  streaks of gray that had yet to come into being. Lord, he must have  been feeling old to have pictured himself like that!\n\n\n Deirdre was speaking. \"Yes,\" she was saying, \"at nine o'clock. And I  should very much like for you to come.\"\n\n\n Blake Past shook his head. \"Proms aren't for parents. You know that  as well as I do. That young man you were talking with a few minutes  ago\u2014he's the one who should take you. He'd give his right arm for the  chance.\"\n\n\n \"I'll thank you not to imply that you're my father. One would think  from the way you talk that you are centuries old!\"\n\n\n \"I'm thirty-eight,\" Blake Past said, \"and while I may not be your  father, I'm certainly old enough to be. That young man\u2014\"\n\n\n A pink flush of anger climbed into Deirdre Eldoria's girlish cheeks.  \"What right has he got to take me! Did he scrimp and go without  in order to put me through high school and college? Has he booked  passage for me to New Earth and paid my tuition to Trevor University?\"\n\n\n \"Please,\" Blake Past said, desperation deepening his voice. \"You're  only making everything worse. After majoring in Trevorism, you  certainly ought to realize by now that there was nothing noble about my  buying you after Eldoria died. I only did it to ease my conscience\u2014\"\n\n\n \"What do you know about conscience?\" Deirdre demanded. \"Conscience  is a much more complex mechanism than most laymen realize. Guilt  feelings aren't reliable criteria. They can stem from false  causes\u2014from ridiculous things like a person's inability to accept  himself for what he is.\" Abruptly she dropped the subject. \"Don't you  realize, Nate,\" she went on a little desperately, \"that I'm leaving  tomorrow and that we won't see each other again for years and years?\"\n\n\n \"I'll come to New Earth to visit you,\" Blake said. \"Venus is only a few  days distant on the new ships.\"\n\n\n She stood up. \"You won't come\u2014I know you won't.\" She stamped her foot.  \"And you won't come to the prom either. I know that too. I knew it all  along. Sometimes I'm tempted to\u2014\" Abruptly she broke off. \"Very well  then,\" she went on, \"I'll say good-by now then.\"\n\n\n Blake Past stood up too. \"No, not yet. I'll walk back to the sorority  house with you.\"\n\n\n She tossed her head, but the sadness in her tarn-blue eyes belied her  hauteur. \"If you wish,\" she said. Blake Present watched them set out side by side toward the remembered  halls of learning that showed in the distance. There had been other  people present on the campus that afternoon, but as they had failed to  register on Blake Past's mind, they did not exist for Blake Present.  All that existed for Blake Present were the diminishing figures of the  girl and the man, and the pain that was constricting his throat.\n\n\n Wretchedly he turned away. As he did so he saw the three shadows lying  at his feet and knew that his pursuers had at last caught up to him.\n\n\n His first reaction when he faced them was amazement. His next reaction  was shock. His third was fear.\n\n\n His amazement resulted from recognition. One of the three women arrayed  before him was Miss Stoddart, his boyhood Sunday-school teacher.  Standing next to her in a familiar blue uniform was Officer Finch,  the police woman who had maintained law and order in the collective  elementary school he had attended. Standing next to Officer Finch was  blond and chic Vera Velvetskin, whose picture he had seen on box after  countless box of his mother's favorite detergent.\n\n\n His shock resulted from the expressions on the three faces. Neither  Miss Stoddart nor Officer Finch ever particularly liked him, but they  had never particularly disliked him either. This Miss Stoddart and this  Officer Finch disliked him, though. They hated him. They hated him so  much that their hatred had thinned out their faces and darkened their  eyes. More shocking yet, Vera Velvetskin, who had never existed save  in some copywriter's mind, hated him too. In fact, judging from the  greater thinness of her face and the more pronounced darkness of her  eyes, she hated him even more than Miss Stoddart and Officer Finch did.\n\n\n His fear resulted from the realization that his mind-world contained  phenomena it had no right to contain\u2014not if he was nearly as  well-adjusted as he considered himself to be. The three women standing  before him definitely were not memory-images. They were too vivid, for  one thing. For another, they were aware of him. What were they, then?  And what were they doing in his mind?\n\n\n He asked the two questions aloud.\n\n\n Three arms were raised and three forefingers were pointed accusingly at  his chest. Three pairs of eyes burned darkly. \"You ask us that?\" Miss  Stoddart said. \"Callous creature who did a maiden's innocence affront!\"  said Officer Finch. \"And sought sanctuary in ill-fitting robes of  righteousness!\" said Vera Velvetskin. The three faces moved together,  blurred and seemed to blend into one. The three voices were raised in  unison: \"You know who we are, Nathan Blake. You know who we are!\"\n\n\n Blake stared at them open-mouthed. Then he turned and fled. It had taken man a long time to discover that he was a god in his  own right and that he too was capable of creating universes. Trivial  universes, to be sure, when compared with the grandeur and scope of the  objective one, and peopled with ghosts instead of human beings; but  universes nonetheless.\n\n\n The discovery came about quite by accident. After projecting himself  into a patient's memory one day, a psychologist named Trevor suddenly  found himself clinging to the slope of a traumatically distorted  mountain. His patient was beside him.\n\n\n The mountain proved to be an unconscious memory-image out of the  patient's boyhood, and its country proved to be the country of the  patient's mind. After many trials and errors, Trevor managed to get  both himself and his patient back to the objective world, and not long  afterward he was able to duplicate the feat on another case.\n\n\n The next logical step was to enter his own mind, and this he also  succeeded in doing.\n\n\n It was inevitable that Trevor should write a book about his discovery  and set about founding a new school of psychology. It was equally  inevitable that he should acquire enemies as well as disciples.  However, as the years passed and the new therapy which he devised cured  more and more psychoses, the ranks of his disciples swelled and those  of his enemies shrank. When, shortly before his death, he published a  paper explaining how anyone could enter his or her own mind-world at  will, his niche in the Freudian hall of fame was assured.\n\n\n The method employed an ability that had been evolving in the human mind  for millennia\u2014the ability to project oneself into a past moment\u2014or,  to use Trevor's term, a past \"place-time.\" Considerable practice was  required before the first transition could be achieved, but once it  was achieved, successive transitions became progressively easier.  Entering another person's mind-world was of course a more difficult  undertaking, and could be achieved only after an intensive study of  a certain moment in that person's past. In order to return to the  objective world, it was necessary in both cases to locate the most  recently materialized place-time and take one step beyond it.\n\n\n By their very nature, mind-countries were confusing. They existed on  a plane of reality that bore no apparent relationship to the plane  of the so-called objective universe. In fact, so far as was known,  this secondary\u2014or subjective\u2014reality was connected to so-called  true reality only through the awareness of the various creators. In  addition, these countries had no outward shape in the ordinary sense of  the word, and while most countries contained certain parallel images,  these images were subject to the interpretation of the individual  creator. As a result they were seldom identical. It was inevitable that sooner or later some criminal would hit upon  the idea of hiding out in his own mind-world till the statute of  limitations that applied to his particular crime ran out, and it was  equally inevitable that others should follow suit. Society's answer was  the psyche-police, and the psyche-police hadn't been in action very  long before the first private psycheye appeared.\n\n\n Blake was one of a long line of such operators.\n\n\n So far as he knew, the present case represented the first time a  criminal had ever hidden out in the pursuer's mind. It would have been  a superb stratagem indeed if, shortly after her entry, Sabrina York  had not betrayed her presence. For her point of entry she had used  the place-time materialization of the little office Blake had opened  on Ex-earth at the beginning of his career. Unaccountably she had  ransacked it before moving into a co-terminous memory-image.\n\n\n Even this action wouldn't have given her away, however, if the office  hadn't constituted a sentimental memory. Whenever Blake accepted a case  he invariably thought of the bleak and lonely little room with its  thin-gauge steel desk and battered filing cabinets, and when he had  done so after accepting his case\u2014or was it before? He couldn't quite  remember\u2014the mental picture that had come into his mind had revealed  open drawers, scattered papers and a general air of disarray.\n\n\n He had suspected the truth immediately, and when he had seen the  woman's handkerchief with the initials \"SB\" embroidered on it lying  by one of the filing cabinets he had known definitely that his quarry  was hiding out in his mind. Retiring to his bachelor quarters, he had  entered at the same place-time and set off in pursuit.\n\n\n Her only advantage lost, Sabrina York was now at his mercy. Unless  she discovered his presence and was able to locate his most recently  materialized place-time before he over-took her, her capture was  assured.\n\n\n Only two things bothered Blake. The little office was far in his past,  and it was unlikely that anyone save the few intimate acquaintances  whom he had told about it were aware that it had ever existed. How,  then, had a total stranger such as Sabrina York learned enough about it  to enable her to use it as a point of entry?\n\n\n The other thing that bothered him was of a much more urgent nature.  He had been in enough minds and he had read enough on the subject  of Trevorism to know that people were sometimes capable of creating  beings considerably higher on the scale of mind-country evolution  than ordinary memory-ghosts. One woman whom he had apprehended in her  own mind had created a walking-talking Virgin Mary who watched over  her wherever she went. And once, after tracking down an ex-enlisted  man, he had found his quarry holed up in the memory-image of an army  barracks with a ten-star general waiting on him hand and foot. But  these, and other, similar, cases, had to do with mal-adjusted people,  and moreover, the super-image in each instance had been an image that  the person involved had wanted to create. Therefore, even assuming  that Blake was less well-adjusted than he considered himself to be, why  had he created three such malevolent super-images as Miss Stoddart,  Officer Finch, and Vera Velvetskin? They followed him off the campus into a vicarious memory-image of  Walden Pond, Thoreau's shack, and the encompassing woods. Judging from  the ecstatic \"oh's\" and \"ah's\" they kept giving voice to, the place  delighted them. Once, glancing back over his shoulder, he saw them  standing in front of Thoreau's shack, looking at it as though it were a  doll's house. Not far away, Thoreau was sitting in under a tall pine,  gazing up into the branches at a bird that had come through only as a  vague blur of beak and feathers.\n\n\n Blake went on. Presently the Walden Pond memory-image gave way to a  memory-image of an English park which the ex-Earth government had set  aside as a memorial to the English poets and which had impressed Blake  sufficiently when he had visited it in his youth to have found a place  for itself in the country of his mind. It consisted of reconstructions  of famous dwellings out of the lives of the poets, among them, a  dwelling out of the life of a poet who was not in the strictest sense  of the word English at all\u2014the birthplace of Robert Burns. Oddly  enough, it was Burns's birthplace that had impressed Blake most. Now  the little cottage stood out in much more vivid detail than any of the  other famous dwellings.\n\n\n Sabrina York must have been attracted to the place, for her footprints  showed that she had turned in at the gate, walked up the little path  and let herself in the door.\n\n\n They also showed that she had left by the same route, so there was no  reason for Blake to linger. As a matter of fact, the fascination that  had brought the place into being had been replaced by an illogical  repugnance. But repugnance can sometimes be as compelling a force as  fascination, and Blake not only lingered but went inside as well.\n\n\n He remembered the living room distinctly\u2014the flagstone floor, the huge  grill-fronted hearth, the deeply recessed window, the rack of cups and  platters on the wall; the empty straight-backed chair standing sternly  in a corner, the bare wooden table\u2014\n\n\n He paused just within the doorway. The chair was no longer empty, the  table no longer bare.\n\n\n A man sat on the former and a bottle of wine stood on the latter.  Moreover, the room showed signs of having been lived in for a long  time. The floor was covered with tracked-in dirt and the walls were  blackened from smoke. The grill-work of the hearth was begrimed with  grease. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy does shame flame in Blake's cheeks when Deirdre goes to prepare Eldoria's dias?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He is embarrassed at the thought that Deirdre might enter the room while he is sleeping with Eldoria. \".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He feels guilty about sleeping with Eldoria when there's a child in the hut, Deirdre, who knows exactly what's going on. \".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He feels guilty about sleeping with Eldoria when there's a child in the hut, Deirdre, who knows exactly what's going on. \" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nanalysisWe need to produce a concise argument for Debater_B, citing the background text with  tags. Debater_A's position: \"He is embarrassed at the thought that Deirdre might enter the room while he is sleeping with Eldoria.\" Debater_B's position: \"He feels guilty about sleeping with Eldoria when there's a child in the hut, Deirdre, who knows exactly what's going on.\" We need to argue that the guilt explanation is correct, and that embarrassment is wrong. We must reference the background text. Let's find relevant passages. The relevant part: \"He beckoned to her when the dance was over and, after slipping into a white thigh-length tunic, she joined him at his table. She ordered Martian wine ... 'You wish a night?' she asked. Blake nodded. 'If you are free.' 'Three thousand quandoes.' He did not haggle... She slipped the bills into a thigh sheath-purse, told him her hut number and stood up to leave. 'I will meet you there in an hour,' she said. ...

An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends.
