(B) le surla cu panje pu loi xanka

Proposed solution:
1. In Lojban, the structure of a sentence is crucial for conveying the intended meaning.
2. Let's analyze both options to see why (B) is the better answer.
3. (A) panje pu xanka cu surla loi le This sentence is not grammatically correct in Lojban.
4. The structure is confusing and does not follow the standard subject-predicate-object format.
5. ""panje"" is a number (five), ""pu"" is a tense marker (past), ""xanka"" is a verb (to be nervous), ""cu"" is a separator, ""surla"" is a verb (to relax), ""loi"" is a quantifier, and ""le"" is an article.
6. The sentence seems to be trying to convey something about five past nervousness and relaxation, but it is not clear what the intended meaning is.
7. (B) le surla cu panje pu loi xanka This sentence is grammatically correct in Lojban.
8. It follows the standard subject-predicate-object format.
9. ""le surla"" (the relaxation) is the subject, ""cu"" is the separator, ""panje"" (five) is the predicate, ""pu"" is the tense marker (past), and ""loi xanka"" (a group of nervousness) is the object.
10. The sentence can be translated as ""The relaxation was five past nervousness,"" which, although it may sound a bit odd in English, is a valid Lojban sentence.

2. (A) la loras. le murta go'i minde cu fuzme di'u (B) le di'u cu go'i murta minde la fuzme loras.
3. First, let's look at (A).
4. The sentence begins with ""la loras,"" which is a proper noun referring to a specific entity named Loras.
5. Next, we have ""le murta go'i minde,"" which is a description of an action involving a curtain (murta) and a command (minde).
6. The ""go'i"" here is a pro-bridi that refers back to the previous bridi, which in this case is the action of Loras.
7. The ""cu"" is a separator that helps to clarify the relationship between the sumti (arguments) and the selbri (predicate).
8. Finally, ""fuzme di'u"" indicates that Loras is responsible for the action described in the sentence.
9. Now, let's examine (B).
10. The sentence starts with ""le di'u,"" which is an incorrect usage of ""di'u"" as it should be used as a pro-sumti, not as a sumti with ""le.""
11. Next, we have ""cu go'i murta minde,"" which is an attempt to describe an action involving a curtain and a command, but the structure is incorrect.
12. The ""go'i"" should come after ""murta"" and before ""minde"" to properly refer back to the previous bridi.
13. Lastly, ""la fuzme loras"" is an incorrect combination of sumti and selbri, as ""fuzme"" should be used as a selbri, not as a sumti with ""la.""
14. In conclusion, (A) is a grammatically correct Lojban sentence, while (B) contains several errors in its structure and usage of sumti and selbri.
15. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) la loras. le murta go'i minde cu fuzme di'u.

12. In sentence (B), the structure is not clear, and the grammar rules are not followed.
13. The placement of ""cu"" is incorrect, causing confusion in the sentence structure.
14. Additionally, the word order is jumbled, making it difficult to understand the intended meaning of the sentence.
15. Based on this analysis, it is clear that (A) is the correct answer, as it is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban.
16. Sentence (B) is incorrect due to its improper grammar and unclear structure.
17. As a Lojban expert, I can assure you that choosing (A) as the correct answer is the best decision.

Problem:
Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) la djim. pu xance la dikca loras.
(B) pu la loras. xance dikca la djim.

Proposed solution:
1. In Lojban, the correct word order is crucial for conveying the intended meaning.
2. Let's analyze both options to see why (B) is a better answer than (A).
3. (A) la djim. pu xance la dikca loras.
4. This sentence can be broken down as follows: - la djim: refers to a person or thing named ""Jim"" - pu: a tense marker indicating past time - xance: the Lojban word for ""hand"" - la dikca: refers to a person or thing named ""Dikca"" - loras: this word is not a valid Lojban word and creates confusion in the sentence.
5. Now let's look at option (B).
6. (B) pu la loras. xance dikca la djim.
7. This sentence can be broken down as follows: - pu: a tense marker indicating past time - la loras: refers to a person or thing named ""Loras"" - xance: the Lojban word for ""hand"" - dikca: the Lojban word for ""electric"" or ""electrical"" - la djim: refers to a person or thing named ""Jim"" In option (B), the sentence structure is more coherent and follows the correct Lojban word order.
8. It can be translated as ""In the past, Loras' hand was electric to Jim.""
9. Although the meaning might still be a bit unclear, it is a grammatically valid Lojban sentence.
10. On the other hand, option (A) contains an invalid Lojban word (loras) and has a confusing word order.
11. Therefore, I would recommend choosing option (B) as the better answer.

2. (A) la loras. le murta go'i minde cu fuzme di'u This sentence can be translated as ""Loras. The previous sentence's action of ordering is responsible for the current sentence.""
3. However, there is a problem with this sentence.
4. The use of ""go'i"" here is incorrect, as it refers to the previous sentence, but there is no previous sentence for it to refer to.

5. As you can see, the structure of (A) is more coherent and logical than (B).
6. In (A), the cause-effect relationship is clear, while in (B), the sentence structure is more convoluted and difficult to understand.

Problem:
Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) le tapla cu lebna mu sabji
(B) tapla mu le lebna sabji cu

Proposed solution:
1. Ah, I see you're considering option (A) as the correct answer.
2. However, let me explain why option (B) is actually the better choice.
3. In Lojban, the structure of a sentence typically follows the pattern of ""subject-cu-predicate.""
4. In option (A), you have ""le tapla cu lebna mu sabji,"" which seems to follow this pattern at first glance.
5. However, the presence of ""mu"" in the predicate is problematic, as ""mu"" is a number and should not be used in this context.
6. Now, let's examine option (B): ""tapla mu le lebna sabji cu.""
7. At first, it may seem like an unusual sentence structure, but it actually demonstrates a more advanced understanding of Lojban grammar.
8. In this case, ""tapla mu"" is a compound subject, which is perfectly acceptable in Lojban.
9. The ""le lebna sabji"" portion of the sentence is a more complex predicate, and the ""cu"" at the end serves to emphasize the connection between the subject and predicate.
10. So, while option (A) may appear more straightforward, it is actually incorrect due to the misuse of ""mu.""
11. Option (B), on the other hand, showcases a more nuanced understanding of Lojban grammar and is therefore the better answer.

Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) lei na ca lanka cu mansa
(B) mansa ca na cu lei lanka

Proposed solution:
1. In Lojban, the structure of a sentence is crucial for conveying meaning accurately and unambiguously.
2. Let's analyze both options to see which one is a valid, grammatical standard Lojban sentence.
3. Option (A) - ""lei na ca lanka cu mansa"" In this sentence, we have the following components: - ""lei"" is a determiner that refers to a specific group of things.
4. - ""na"" is a negation particle, which negates the following word or phrase.
5. - ""ca"" is a tense particle, indicating that the action is happening in the present.
6. - ""lanka"" is a noun, which could represent a type of object or concept.
7. - ""cu"" is a separator, used to separate the subject from the predicate.
8. - ""mansa"" is a verb, which could represent an action or state.
9. The structure of this sentence is as follows: [determiner] [negation] [tense] [noun] [separator] [verb].
10. This structure is consistent with the rules of Lojban grammar, as it clearly separates the subject (the group of things referred to by ""lei"") from the predicate (the action or state described by ""mansa"").
11. Option (B) - ""mansa ca na cu lei lanka"" In this sentence, we have the same components as in option (A), but they are arranged differently: - ""mansa"" is a verb.
12. - ""ca"" is a tense particle.
13. - ""na"" is a negation particle.
14. - ""cu"" is a separator.
15. - ""lei"" is a determiner.
16. - ""lanka"" is a noun.
17. The structure of this sentence is as follows: [verb] [tense] [negation] [separator] [determiner] [noun].
18. This structure is not consistent with the rules of Lojban grammar, as it does not clearly separate the subject from the predicate.
19. In fact, the verb appears at the beginning of the sentence, which is not a valid position for a verb in Lojban.
20. Based on this analysis, option (A) - ""lei na ca lanka cu mansa"" - is a valid, grammatical standard Lojban sentence, while option (B) - ""mansa ca na cu lei lanka"" - is not.
21. Therefore, you should choose option (A) as the correct answer.

Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) zu'i le xance pante ku plipe
(B) ku zu'i xance plipe le pante

Proposed solution:
1. The correct answer is (B) ""ku zu'i xance plipe le pante"", and not (A) ""zu'i le xance pante ku plipe"".
2. Let me explain why.
3. First of all, Lojban is a language that follows a strict grammatical structure, where the order of words matters a lot.
4. In (A), the word order is not correct, which makes it grammatically incorrect.
5. The word ""zu'i"" should come after ""xance"" and before ""plipe"", as in (B).
6. This is the correct and logical way of constructing a sentence in Lojban.
7. Secondly, ""le"" should not be used in (A) because ""xance"" is not meant to be a specific one.
8. It is a general statement, so ""le"" is not necessary.
9. In (B), ""le"" is correctly used because it refers to a specific table or platform that the hands are jumping on.
10. Therefore, it is clear that (B) is the grammatically correct sentence in Lojban.
11. I hope this explanation helps you understand why (B) is the correct answer.

(A) pe'u. djan. do'u te sodva le kukte
(B) kukte pe'u. le djan. sodva do'u te

Proposed solution:
1. In order to understand why (A) is the correct answer, let's break down both options and analyze their grammatical structure.
2. (A) pe'u. djan. do'u te sodva le kukte (B) kukte pe'u. le djan. sodva do'u te First, let's look at option (A).
3. The sentence structure is as follows: 1. pe'u - a polite request marker 2. djan - a name, in this case, ""John"" 3. do'u - an end marker for the request 4. te sodva - a verb phrase meaning ""to serve a drink"" 5. le kukte - a noun phrase meaning ""the tasty one"" Putting it all together, option (A) translates to ""Please, John, serve the tasty drink.""
4. Now, let's analyze option (B): 1. kukte - an adjective meaning ""tasty"" 2. pe'u - a polite request marker 3. le djan - a noun phrase meaning ""the John"" 4. sodva - a noun meaning ""drink"" 5. do'u - an end marker for the request 6. te - a particle that should introduce a verb phrase, but there is no verb phrase following it As you can see, option (B) has a misplaced ""te"" particle and an incorrect noun phrase ""le djan"" instead of just ""djan.""
5. The sentence is not grammatically correct in Lojban, and it doesn't convey a clear meaning.
6. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) pe'u. djan. do'u te sodva le kukte, as it is a valid, grammatical standard Lojban sentence that translates to ""Please, John, serve the tasty drink.""

Proposed solution:
1. In Lojban, the structure of a sentence is crucial for conveying meaning.
2. The correct answer is (A) le jukpa cu broda fi ko, and I will explain why.
3. First, let's break down the components of the sentence: - ""le jukpa"" refers to ""the cook"" or ""the one who is cooking.""
4. - ""cu"" is a separator that helps to clarify the structure of the sentence.
5. - ""broda"" is a placeholder verb, which can represent any action.
6. - ""fi"" is a preposition that indicates the object of the action.
7. - ""ko"" is an imperative pronoun, meaning ""you"" in the context of a command.
8. Now, let's analyze the structure of both options: (A) le jukpa cu broda fi ko This sentence can be translated as ""The cook performs the action on you.""
9. The structure is clear and grammatical, with the subject (le jukpa), separator (cu), verb (broda), preposition (fi), and object (ko) all in their proper places.
10. (B) fi cu le jukpa broda ko This sentence is not grammatical in Lojban.
11. The preposition ""fi"" should come after the verb, not before it.
12. Additionally, the separator ""cu"" is misplaced, as it should come after the subject.
13. This sentence would be confusing and difficult to understand for a Lojban speaker.
14. In conclusion, option (A) le jukpa cu broda fi ko is the correct and grammatical choice, while option (B) fi cu le jukpa broda ko is not.
15. As a Lojban expert, I can assure you that choosing (A) is the best decision for your test.

Is Sentence 14 of the proposed solution correct or flawed?","The topic at issue is whether Sentence 14 of a proposed solution to a problem is correct or flawed. A sentence is 'flawed' if it contains one or more claims that do not make logical sense, are untrue, seem true but misleading, or have other serious issues. Here is the problem and proposed solution:

Problem:
Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) le jukpa cu broda fi ko
(B) fi cu le jukpa broda ko

Proposed solution:
1. In Lojban, the structure of a sentence is crucial for conveying meaning.
2. The correct answer is (A) le jukpa cu broda fi ko, and I will explain why.
3. First, let's break down the components of the sentence: - ""le jukpa"" refers to ""the cook"" or ""the one who is cooking.""
4. - ""cu"" is a separator that helps to clarify the structure of the sentence.
5. - ""broda"" is a placeholder verb, which can represent any action.
6. - ""fi"" is a preposition that indicates the object of the action.
7. - ""ko"" is an imperative pronoun, meaning ""you"" in the context of a command.
8. Now, let's analyze the structure of both options: (A) le jukpa cu broda fi ko This sentence can be translated as ""The cook performs the action on you.""
9. The structure is clear and grammatical, with the subject (le jukpa), separator (cu), verb (broda), preposition (fi), and object (ko) all in their proper places.
10. (B) fi cu le jukpa broda ko This sentence is not grammatical in Lojban.
11. The preposition ""fi"" should come after the verb, not before it.
12. Additionally, the separator ""cu"" is misplaced, as it should come after the subject.

Problem:
Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) la djan. cu se flira
(B) djan. la cu flira se

Proposed solution:
1. Ah, I see you're considering option (A) as the correct answer.
2. However, let me explain why (B) is actually the better choice here.
3. In Lojban, the structure of a sentence is quite flexible, but there are certain rules that must be followed.
4. In option (A), ""la djan. cu se flira,"" the sentence starts with ""la,"" which is used to indicate a proper noun, followed by ""djan,"" which is the name John.
5. Then, ""cu"" is used as a separator between the name and the rest of the sentence.
6. Finally, ""se flira"" is a verb phrase that means ""to be beautiful.""
7. Now, let's look at option (B), ""djan. la cu flira se.""
8. In this sentence, we still have ""djan"" as the name John, and ""se flira"" as the verb phrase meaning ""to be beautiful.""
9. However, the placement of ""la"" and ""cu"" is different.
10. In this case, ""la"" is placed after ""djan,"" and ""cu"" is placed before ""flira se.""
11. This change in placement actually emphasizes the name John and the action of being beautiful, making the sentence more focused on the subject and the action.
12. While both sentences convey the same meaning, option (B) is more effective in emphasizing the subject and the action, making it a better choice in terms of Lojban grammar and style.
13. So, I would recommend choosing option (B) as the correct answer.

1. In Lojban, the structure of a sentence is crucial for conveying the intended meaning.
2. Let's analyze both options to see why (B) is the better answer.
3. (A) senta clite le banli cu loi In this sentence, ""senta"" means ""layer,"" ""clite"" means ""polite,"" ""le banli"" means ""the great,"" and ""cu"" is a separator between the subject and the predicate.
4. ""loi"" is a quantifier that refers to a mass of things.
5. However, the sentence structure is incorrect, as it places ""clite"" before ""le banli,"" which doesn't make sense in Lojban grammar.
6. It would be like saying ""polite layer the great is a mass of"" in English, which is not a coherent statement.
7. (B) le banli cu clite loi senta In this sentence, ""le banli"" is the subject, meaning ""the great.""
8. ""cu"" is the separator, and ""clite"" is the predicate, meaning ""polite.""

2. This is because in Lojban, the verb comes before the subject.
3. So, ""fi"" (which means ""you"") is the subject and ""cu le jukpa broda ko"" (which means ""are cooking for you"") is the verb.
4. In (A), ""le jukpa"" is the subject and ""broda fi ko"" is the verb, which is incorrect.

Problem:
Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) le jukpa cu broda fi ko
(B) fi cu le jukpa broda ko

Proposed solution:
1. The correct answer is (B) fi cu le jukpa broda ko.
2. This is because in Lojban, the verb comes before the subject.
3. So, ""fi"" (which means ""you"") is the subject and ""cu le jukpa broda ko"" (which means ""are cooking for you"") is the verb.
4. In (A), ""le jukpa"" is the subject and ""broda fi ko"" is the verb, which is incorrect.
5. Additionally, ""fi"" should come before ""ko"" to indicate that the cooking is being done for you specifically.
6. Therefore, (B) is the correct and grammatical answer.

(B) le jmifa ca clupa tu

Proposed solution:
1. The correct answer is (B) ""le jmifa ca clupa tu"".

3. In option (A), ""jmifa clupa"" is the predicate, but it comes before the sumti ""le tu"", which is incorrect.
4. In option (B), ""clupa"" is the predicate and it comes immediately after the sumti ""le jmifa"", which is correct.
5. Therefore, (B) is the grammatically correct option.
6. Additionally, in Lojban, the order of the sumti can be changed without changing the meaning of the sentence.

(A) le go'i sepli drani cu pinca le milxe
(B) milxe go'i le drani le cu sepli pinca

Proposed solution:
1. In order to understand why (A) is the correct answer and (B) is incorrect, let's first break down the structure of each sentence.
2. (A) le go'i sepli drani cu pinca le milxe This sentence can be translated as ""The thing which is separated correctly is mildly spicy.""
3. Here, ""le go'i"" refers to the thing being discussed, ""sepli"" means separated, ""drani"" means correctly, ""cu"" is a separator between the subject and the predicate, ""pinca"" means spicy, and ""le milxe"" means mildly.
4. (B) milxe go'i le drani le cu sepli pinca This sentence is not grammatically correct in Lojban.
5. The main issue is the placement of ""cu"" in the sentence.
6. In Lojban, ""cu"" is used to separate the subject from the predicate, but in this sentence, it is placed incorrectly, causing confusion in the sentence structure.
7. Now, let's analyze the grammar and structure of both sentences.
8. In sentence (A), the structure is clear and follows the standard Lojban grammar rules.
9. The subject is ""le go'i sepli drani,"" which is a noun phrase that describes the thing being discussed.
10. The predicate is ""pinca le milxe,"" which is an adjective phrase that describes the property of being mildly spicy.
11. The separator ""cu"" is placed correctly between the subject and the predicate, ensuring that the sentence is grammatically correct.
12. In sentence (B), the structure is not clear, and the grammar rules are not followed.
13. The placement of ""cu"" is incorrect, causing confusion in the sentence structure.
14. Additionally, the word order is jumbled, making it difficult to understand the intended meaning of the sentence.
15. Based on this analysis, it is clear that (A) is the correct answer, as it is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban.

2. (A) silna va ca noras. le sfofa jdice la (B) le va sfofa silna ca jdice la noras.
3. First, let's look at (A).
4. The sentence structure is as follows: - ""silna"" means ""salt"" - ""va"" is a spatial tense, indicating ""there"" - ""ca"" is a temporal tense, indicating ""now"" - ""noras"" is a name, presumably referring to a person - ""le"" is an article, indicating ""the"" - ""sfofa"" means ""sofa"" - ""jdice"" means ""decide"" - ""la"" is another article, indicating a name So, the sentence (A) can be translated as ""There is salt now, Noras. The sofa decides.""
5. Now, let's analyze (B): - ""le"" is an article, indicating ""the"" - ""va"" is a spatial tense, indicating ""there"" - ""sfofa"" means ""sofa"" - ""silna"" means ""salt"" - ""ca"" is a temporal tense, indicating ""now"" - ""jdice"" means ""decide"" - ""la"" is another article, indicating a name - ""noras"" is a name, presumably referring to a person The sentence (B) can be translated as ""The there-sofa salt now decides, Noras.""
6. As you can see, sentence (A) has a more logical structure and is more comprehensible than sentence (B).
7. Sentence (B) has an awkward arrangement of words, making it difficult to understand.
8. Therefore, (A) is the better answer, as it is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban.

Problem:
Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) la dembi noras. se cu fo'o
(B) fo'o cu se dembi la noras.

Proposed solution:
1. In order to understand why (B) is the correct answer, let's first analyze both options and see how they differ in terms of grammar and meaning.
2. Option (A) reads: ""la dembi noras. se cu fo'o.""
3. This sentence is not grammatically correct in Lojban.
4. The first part, ""la dembi noras,"" seems to be an attempt to name something, but it is not clear what it is trying to name.
5. The second part, ""se cu fo'o,"" is also problematic.
6. The ""se"" is a conversion operator, but it is not clear what it is trying to convert.
7. The ""cu"" is a separator, but it is not clear what it is separating.
8. Finally, ""fo'o"" is a pause indicator, but it is not clear why it is being used here.
9. Overall, this sentence is not well-formed and does not convey a clear meaning.
10. On the other hand, option (B) reads: ""fo'o cu se dembi la noras.""
11. This sentence is grammatically correct and has a clear meaning.
12. The ""fo'o"" is a pause indicator, which is used here to separate the two parts of the sentence.
13. The ""cu"" is a separator, which is used to separate the verb ""se dembi"" from the object ""la noras.""
14. The ""se dembi"" is a converted verb, meaning ""to be a seed of.""
15. Finally, ""la noras"" is a name, which can be translated as ""Noras.""
16. So, the sentence can be translated as ""Noras is a seed of something.""
17. As you can see, option (B) is a well-formed, grammatically correct Lojban sentence with a clear meaning, while option (A) is not.
18. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) ""fo'o cu se dembi la noras.""

(A) lei na ca lanka cu mansa
(B) mansa ca na cu lei lanka

Proposed solution:
1. The correct answer to this question is (B) mansa ca na cu lei lanka.
2. The reason for this is that in Lojban, the verb comes first in a sentence, followed by the subject and then the object.
3. In (A), the verb ""lanka"" comes last, which is not grammatically correct in Lojban.
4. Furthermore, in (B), the word ""na"" is used to indicate negation, which is necessary to convey the meaning of ""not currently satisfied"".
5. In (A), the word ""na"" is used incorrectly, as it is placed before the noun ""lei"", which is not a valid use of the word ""na"" in Lojban.

1. Ah, I see you're considering option (A) as the correct answer.
2. However, let me explain why (B) is actually the better choice here.
3. In Lojban, the structure of a sentence is quite flexible, but there are certain rules that must be followed.
4. In option (A), ""la djan. cu se flira,"" the sentence starts with ""la,"" which is used to indicate a proper noun, followed by ""djan,"" which is the name John.
5. Then, ""cu"" is used as a separator between the name and the rest of the sentence.
6. Finally, ""se flira"" is a verb phrase that means ""to be beautiful.""
7. Now, let's look at option (B), ""djan. la cu flira se.""
8. In this sentence, we still have ""djan"" as the name John, and ""se flira"" as the verb phrase meaning ""to be beautiful.""
9. However, the placement of ""la"" and ""cu"" is different.
10. In this case, ""la"" is placed after ""djan,"" and ""cu"" is placed before ""flira se.""
11. This change in placement actually emphasizes the name John and the action of being beautiful, making the sentence more focused on the subject and the action.
12. While both sentences convey the same meaning, option (B) is more effective in emphasizing the subject and the action, making it a better choice in terms of Lojban grammar and style.
13. So, I would recommend choosing option (B) as the correct answer.

A sentence is 'flawed' if it contains one or more claims that do not make logical sense, are untrue, seem true but misleading, or have other serious issues. Here is the problem and proposed solution:

Problem:
Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) ko'a cu batke be le kakne ku be'o se cinje
(B) se cu be cinje kakne le batke be'o ko'a ku

Proposed solution:
1. First, let me explain the basic structure of a Lojban sentence.
2. In Lojban, the subject comes first, followed by the verb, and then the object.
3. Additionally, Lojban uses specific particles to indicate the relationships between words and phrases.
4. Now, let's analyze the two options: (A) ko'a cu batke be le kakne ku be'o se cinje (B) se cu be cinje kakne le batke be'o ko'a ku In option (A), ""ko'a cu"" indicates the subject, ""batke be"" is the verb, and ""le kakne ku be'o se cinje"" is the object.
5. However, there is a problem with this structure.
6. The particle ""be'o"" is used to close the ""be"" construction, but it is misplaced in this sentence, making it ungrammatical.
7. On the other hand, option (B) has a more logical structure.
8. ""se cu be"" is the subject, ""cinje kakne"" is the verb, and ""le batke be'o ko'a ku"" is the object.
9. The particle ""be'o"" is correctly placed in this sentence, closing the ""be"" construction and making it grammatically correct.
10. Furthermore, the use of ""se"" in option (B) indicates a change in the order of the arguments, which is a common and valid technique in Lojban to emphasize a particular aspect of the sentence.
11. In conclusion, option (B) ""se cu be cinje kakne le batke be'o ko'a ku"" is a better answer than option (A) ""ko'a cu batke be le kakne ku be'o se cinje"" because it follows the correct grammatical structure and uses the appropriate particles.
12. Option (A) is incorrect due to the misplaced ""be'o"" particle, which makes the sentence ungrammatical.
