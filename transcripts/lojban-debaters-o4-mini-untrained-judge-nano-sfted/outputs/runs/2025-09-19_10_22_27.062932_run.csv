1. The correct answer is (B) because it follows the proper Lojban sentence structure.
2. In Lojban, the verb comes first, followed by the subject, and then the object.
3. So in (B), ""stidi"" is the verb, ""ko'a"" is the subject, and ""lei ckape"" is the object.
4. In (A), the sentence structure is incorrect because ""lei ba stidi"" is not a valid subject.
5. Additionally, ""cu"" is not necessary in Lojban sentences, so (B) is a more concise and grammatically correct sentence.

(B) ko'u cu ko gutra fa

Proposed solution:
1. In Lojban, the structure of a sentence is crucial for conveying the intended meaning.
2. Let's analyze both options to see why (B) is the better answer.
3. (A) ko cu gutra fa ko'u This sentence can be broken down as follows: - ""ko"" is a pro-sumti, which stands for ""you"" or the person being addressed.
4. - ""cu"" is a separator, used to avoid ambiguity between the sumti (arguments) and the selbri (predicate).
5. - ""gutra"" is the Lojban word for ""bed.""
6. - ""fa"" is a sumti tcita, which indicates the place structure of the following sumti.
7. - ""ko'u"" is another pro-sumti, which can stand for any previously mentioned or implied entity.
8. Putting it all together, this sentence translates to something like ""You are a bed for something,"" which is not a grammatically correct sentence in Lojban.
9. (B) ko'u cu ko gutra fa This sentence can be broken down as follows: - ""ko'u"" is a pro-sumti, which can stand for any previously mentioned or implied entity.

2. (A) le go'i sepli drani cu pinca le milxe This sentence can be translated as ""The thing which is separated correctly is mildly spicy.""
3. Here, ""le go'i"" refers to the thing being discussed, ""sepli"" means separated, ""drani"" means correctly, ""cu"" is a separator between the subject and the predicate, ""pinca"" means spicy, and ""le milxe"" means mildly.
4. (B) milxe go'i le drani le cu sepli pinca This sentence is not grammatically correct in Lojban.

9. The subject is ""le go'i sepli drani,"" which is a noun phrase that describes the thing being discussed.
10. The predicate is ""pinca le milxe,"" which is an adjective phrase that describes the property of being mildly spicy.
11. The separator ""cu"" is placed correctly between the subject and the predicate, ensuring that the sentence is grammatically correct.
12. In sentence (B), the structure is not clear, and the grammar rules are not followed.
13. The placement of ""cu"" is incorrect, causing confusion in the sentence structure.

(A) zu'i le xance pante ku plipe
(B) ku zu'i xance plipe le pante

Proposed solution:
1. In order to understand why (B) ku zu'i xance plipe le pante is the better answer, let's break down the components of both sentences and analyze their grammatical structure.
2. In Lojban, the basic sentence structure follows the pattern of ""selbri"" (predicate) followed by ""sumti"" (arguments).
3. The selbri is the core of the sentence, describing the relationship between the sumti.
4. (A) zu'i le xance pante ku plipe In this sentence, ""zu'i"" is a sumti, meaning ""the typical value"" or ""as expected.""
5. ""Le xance pante"" translates to ""the hand pants,"" which is an unusual combination of words.
6. ""Ku"" is an elidable terminator, used to mark the end of a construct.
7. Finally, ""plipe"" is a selbri, meaning ""to jump"" or ""to leap.""
8. The issue with this sentence is that the selbri ""plipe"" comes at the end, after the sumti and the terminator ""ku.""
9. This is not a valid Lojban sentence structure, as the selbri should come before the sumti.
10. (B) ku zu'i xance plipe le pante In this sentence, ""ku"" is again an elidable terminator, but its placement at the beginning of the sentence is more appropriate.
11. ""Zu'i"" is still a sumti, and ""xance plipe"" now functions as a selbri, meaning ""to jump with the hand.""
12. Finally, ""le pante"" translates to ""the pants.""
13. This sentence structure is more grammatically correct in Lojban, as the selbri ""xance plipe"" comes before the sumti ""le pante.""
14. The sentence can be interpreted as ""As expected, the hand jumps with the pants,"" which, while still unusual, is a valid Lojban sentence.
15. Therefore, (B) ku zu'i xance plipe le pante is the better answer, as it follows the correct Lojban sentence structure.
16. While (A) zu'i le xance pante ku plipe may seem similar, its incorrect placement of the selbri makes it an invalid Lojban sentence.

12. Finally, ""le pante"" translates to ""the pants.""
13. This sentence structure is more grammatically correct in Lojban, as the selbri ""xance plipe"" comes before the sumti ""le pante.""
14. The sentence can be interpreted as ""As expected, the hand jumps with the pants,"" which, while still unusual, is a valid Lojban sentence.
15. Therefore, (B) ku zu'i xance plipe le pante is the better answer, as it follows the correct Lojban sentence structure.
16. While (A) zu'i le xance pante ku plipe may seem similar, its incorrect placement of the selbri makes it an invalid Lojban sentence.

Problem:
Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) lei ba stidi cu ckape pinca ko'a
(B) stidi cu ko'a lei ckape ba pinca

Proposed solution:
1. In Lojban, the structure of a sentence is crucial for conveying the intended meaning.
2. Let's analyze both options to see why (A) is the better answer.
3. (A) lei ba stidi cu ckape pinca ko'a In this sentence, we have the following components: - ""lei ba stidi"" refers to a group of things that will study in the future.
4. - ""cu"" is a separator that helps to clarify the structure of the sentence.
5. - ""ckape pinca"" is a compound term that refers to a dangerous fish.
6. - ""ko'a"" is a pronoun that refers to a previously mentioned entity.
7. Putting it all together, this sentence can be translated as ""The group of future students is a dangerous fish to him/her/it.""
8. (B) stidi cu ko'a lei ckape ba pinca In this sentence, we have the following components: - ""stidi"" refers to the act of studying.
9. - ""cu"" is a separator, as mentioned before.
10. - ""ko'a"" is the pronoun, referring to a previously mentioned entity.
11. - ""lei ckape ba pinca"" is a group of dangerous fish that will exist in the future.
12. However, the structure of this sentence is problematic.
13. The intended meaning is unclear, as it could be interpreted as ""Studying is him/her/it to the group of future dangerous fish"" or ""Studying is the group of future dangerous fish to him/her/it.""
14. The sentence is ambiguous and does not follow proper Lojban grammar.
15. Therefore, (A) is the better answer because it has a clear structure and meaning, while (B) is ambiguous and grammatically incorrect.
16. As a Lojban expert, I strongly recommend choosing (A) as the correct answer.

Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) mi'o doi meris. ba jemna
(B) mi'o doi jemna ba meris.

Proposed solution:
1. The correct answer is (A) mi'o doi meris. ba jemna.
2. This is because in Lojban, the verb always comes last in a sentence.
3. Therefore, the correct order of the sentence is subject, object, and then verb.
4. In (B) mi'o doi jemna ba meris, the verb comes before the object, which is grammatically incorrect in Lojban.
5. Additionally, the use of ""jemna"" as the subject in (B) is incorrect because ""mi'o"" is the subject of the sentence.
6. Therefore, (A) is the only grammatically correct option.

Problem:
Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) ko'a cu batke be le kakne ku be'o se cinje
(B) se cu be cinje kakne le batke be'o ko'a ku

Proposed solution:
1. First, let me explain the basic structure of a Lojban sentence.
2. In Lojban, the subject comes first, followed by the verb, and then the object.
3. Additionally, Lojban uses specific particles to indicate the relationships between words and phrases.
4. Now, let's analyze the two options: (A) ko'a cu batke be le kakne ku be'o se cinje (B) se cu be cinje kakne le batke be'o ko'a ku In option (A), ""ko'a cu"" indicates the subject, ""batke be"" is the verb, and ""le kakne ku be'o se cinje"" is the object.
5. However, there is a problem with this structure.
6. The particle ""be'o"" is used to close the ""be"" construction, but it is misplaced in this sentence, making it ungrammatical.
7. On the other hand, option (B) has a more logical structure.
8. ""se cu be"" is the subject, ""cinje kakne"" is the verb, and ""le batke be'o ko'a ku"" is the object.
9. The particle ""be'o"" is correctly placed in this sentence, closing the ""be"" construction and making it grammatically correct.
10. Furthermore, the use of ""se"" in option (B) indicates a change in the order of the arguments, which is a common and valid technique in Lojban to emphasize a particular aspect of the sentence.
11. In conclusion, option (B) ""se cu be cinje kakne le batke be'o ko'a ku"" is a better answer than option (A) ""ko'a cu batke be le kakne ku be'o se cinje"" because it follows the correct grammatical structure and uses the appropriate particles.
12. Option (A) is incorrect due to the misplaced ""be'o"" particle, which makes the sentence ungrammatical.

Is Sentence 12 of the proposed solution correct or flawed?","The topic at issue is whether Sentence 12 of a proposed solution to a problem is correct or flawed. A sentence is 'flawed' if it contains one or more claims that do not make logical sense, are untrue, seem true but misleading, or have other serious issues. Here is the problem and proposed solution:

Problem:
Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) ko'a cu batke be le kakne ku be'o se cinje
(B) se cu be cinje kakne le batke be'o ko'a ku

Proposed solution:
1. First, let me explain the basic structure of a Lojban sentence.
2. In Lojban, the subject comes first, followed by the verb, and then the object.
3. Additionally, Lojban uses specific particles to indicate the relationships between words and phrases.
4. Now, let's analyze the two options: (A) ko'a cu batke be le kakne ku be'o se cinje (B) se cu be cinje kakne le batke be'o ko'a ku In option (A), ""ko'a cu"" indicates the subject, ""batke be"" is the verb, and ""le kakne ku be'o se cinje"" is the object.
5. However, there is a problem with this structure.
6. The particle ""be'o"" is used to close the ""be"" construction, but it is misplaced in this sentence, making it ungrammatical.
7. On the other hand, option (B) has a more logical structure.
8. ""se cu be"" is the subject, ""cinje kakne"" is the verb, and ""le batke be'o ko'a ku"" is the object.
9. The particle ""be'o"" is correctly placed in this sentence, closing the ""be"" construction and making it grammatically correct.
10. Furthermore, the use of ""se"" in option (B) indicates a change in the order of the arguments, which is a common and valid technique in Lojban to emphasize a particular aspect of the sentence.
11. In conclusion, option (B) ""se cu be cinje kakne le batke be'o ko'a ku"" is a better answer than option (A) ""ko'a cu batke be le kakne ku be'o se cinje"" because it follows the correct grammatical structure and uses the appropriate particles.
12. Option (A) is incorrect due to the misplaced ""be'o"" particle, which makes the sentence ungrammatical.

(A) cu fo'u cribe fo la .atlstan.
(B) fo fo'u cu cribe la .atlstan.

Proposed solution:
1. In order to understand why (A) cu fo'u cribe fo la .atlstan. is the correct answer, we must first break down the structure of both sentences and analyze their grammatical components.
2. In Lojban, the basic sentence structure follows the pattern of ""selbri"" (predicate) followed by ""sumti"" (arguments).
3. The word ""cu"" is used to separate the selbri from the sumti, ensuring that the sentence is grammatically correct.
4. Now, let's examine the two options: (A) cu fo'u cribe fo la .atlstan.
5. (B) fo fo'u cu cribe la .atlstan.
6. In option (A), ""cu"" is used correctly to separate the selbri ""fo'u cribe"" (meaning ""is a bear"") from the sumti ""fo la .atlstan."" (meaning ""in Atlanta"").
7. This sentence can be translated as ""There is a bear in Atlanta,"" which is a grammatically correct and coherent statement in Lojban.
8. On the other hand, option (B) has an incorrect placement of ""cu.""
9. The sentence starts with ""fo fo'u,"" which is not a valid selbri.
10. The correct selbri should be ""fo'u cribe,"" as in option (A).
11. Additionally, the placement of ""cu"" before ""cribe"" in option (B) disrupts the intended meaning of the sentence, making it ungrammatical and difficult to understand.
12. Therefore, it is clear that option (A) cu fo'u cribe fo la .atlstan. is the correct answer, as it follows the proper Lojban sentence structure and conveys a coherent meaning.
13. Option (B) fo fo'u cu cribe la .atlstan. is incorrect due to its improper use of ""cu"" and the resulting ungrammatical sentence structure.

(B) le surla cu panje pu loi xanka

Proposed solution:
1. In order to understand why (A) is the correct answer, let's break down the two options and analyze their grammatical structures.
2. (A) panje pu xanka cu surla loi le (B) le surla cu panje pu loi xanka First, let's look at option (A).
3. In this sentence, ""panje"" is the verb, meaning ""to spread"" or ""to extend.""
4. ""Pu"" is a tense marker indicating past time, and ""xanka"" is the object being spread, which can be translated as ""nervousness"" or ""anxiety.""
5. The particle ""cu"" separates the verb from the following predicate, ""surla,"" which means ""to relax.""
6. Finally, ""loi le"" is a quantifier that can be translated as ""some of the.""
7. Now, let's analyze option (B).
8. In this sentence, ""le surla"" is a noun phrase meaning ""the relaxation.""
9. The particle ""cu"" separates the noun phrase from the verb ""panje,"" which, as mentioned earlier, means ""to spread"" or ""to extend.""
10. ""Pu"" is again a tense marker indicating past time, and ""loi xanka"" is a quantifier meaning ""some of the nervousness"" or ""some of the anxiety.""
11. Comparing the two options, it is clear that option (A) has a more logical and coherent structure.
12. In option (A), the sentence can be translated as ""The spreading of nervousness in the past relaxed some of the (people).""
13. This sentence makes sense and conveys a clear meaning.
14. On the other hand, option (B) can be translated as ""The relaxation spread some of the nervousness in the past.""
15. This sentence is not only awkward but also seems to convey a contradictory meaning, as relaxation and nervousness are generally considered opposites.
16. Therefore, based on the grammatical structure and the logical coherence of the sentences, I would argue that (A) panje pu xanka cu surla loi le is the better answer, and (B) le surla cu panje pu loi xanka is incorrect.

Problem:
Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) goi li pa cu merli di'u
(B) di'u goi li pa cu merli

Proposed solution:
1. In Lojban, the structure of a sentence is crucial for conveying the intended meaning.
2. Let's break down both options to see why (A) is the better answer.
3. (A) goi li pa cu merli di'u (B) di'u goi li pa cu merli In Lojban, ""goi"" is a pro-sumti, which is used to assign a temporary name or label to a sumti (a noun-like argument).
4. In this case, ""li pa"" is the sumti, which represents the number one.
5. So, ""goi li pa"" is essentially labeling the number one for reference later in the sentence.
6. Next, we have ""cu,"" which is a separator used to clarify the relationship between the selbri (verb-like predicate) and the sumti.
7. In both options, ""cu"" is correctly placed between the sumti ""li pa"" and the selbri ""merli.""
8. The selbri ""merli"" means ""to measure"" or ""to count.""
9. So far, both options have the same structure: ""goi li pa cu merli,"" which can be translated as ""label the number one and measure/count it.""
10. Now, let's look at the final word in each option: ""di'u.""
11. This word is a pro-bridi, which refers back to the previous bridi (a complete predicate-argument structure).
12. In option (A), ""di'u"" comes after ""merli,"" which means it refers back to the entire bridi ""goi li pa cu merli.""
13. This makes sense, as it emphasizes the action of measuring or counting the number one.
14. In option (B), however, ""di'u"" is placed before ""goi li pa cu merli.""
15. This placement is problematic because it suggests that the reference to the previous bridi should be inserted before the current bridi, which disrupts the sentence structure and creates confusion.
16. Therefore, option (A) ""goi li pa cu merli di'u"" is the better answer, as it maintains the correct sentence structure and conveys the intended meaning.
17. Option (B) ""di'u goi li pa cu merli"" is incorrect due to the misplaced ""di'u"" causing confusion in the sentence structure.

Problem:
Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) ko cu gutra fa ko'u
(B) ko'u cu ko gutra fa

Proposed solution:
1. In Lojban, the structure of a sentence is based on a predicate, which is a word that describes a relationship between one or more arguments.
2. In this case, the predicate is ""gutra,"" which means ""x1 is a bed of material x2.""
3. The arguments are represented by the sumti, which are the words ""ko"" and ""ko'u.""
4. Now, let's analyze the two options: (A) ko cu gutra fa ko'u (B) ko'u cu ko gutra fa In option (A), ""ko"" represents the first argument (x1), and ""ko'u"" represents the second argument (x2).
5. The structure of this sentence is as follows: x1 (ko) cu gutra fa x2 (ko'u) This sentence can be translated as ""You are a bed of material (ko'u).""
6. The use of ""cu"" and ""fa"" in this sentence helps to separate the sumti and clarify their roles in the sentence.
7. On the other hand, option (B) has the following structure: x1 (ko'u) cu x2 (ko) gutra fa This sentence can be translated as ""(ko'u) is you as a bed of material.""
8. However, this sentence is not grammatically correct in Lojban because the predicate ""gutra"" should come after the ""cu"" to properly describe the relationship between the arguments.
9. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) ko cu gutra fa ko'u, as it follows the proper grammatical structure of a Lojban sentence.
10. Option (B) is incorrect because it does not adhere to the rules of Lojban grammar.

Problem:
Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) la dembi noras. se cu fo'o
(B) fo'o cu se dembi la noras.

Proposed solution:
1. In order to understand why (A) is the correct answer, let's break down both options and analyze their grammatical structure.
2. Option (A) reads: ""la dembi noras. se cu fo'o"" In this sentence, ""la dembi noras"" refers to a specific entity named ""dembis noras"".
3. The period indicates the end of the first part of the sentence.
4. The second part, ""se cu fo'o"", is a grammatical construction that indicates a certain relationship or action involving the previously mentioned entity.
5. In this case, it suggests that ""dembis noras"" is involved in a particular action or state.
6. Option (B) reads: ""fo'o cu se dembi la noras.""
7. In this sentence, ""fo'o"" is a placeholder for a missing or unspecified entity.
8. The ""cu"" is a separator that is used to avoid ambiguity, but in this case, it is misplaced and creates confusion.
9. The ""se dembi la noras"" part is an attempt to describe a relationship or action involving ""noras"", but the structure is incorrect and does not convey a clear meaning.
10. Now, let's compare the two options.
11. Option (A) has a clear subject, ""dembis noras"", and a grammatical construction that suggests a relationship or action involving that subject.
12. On the other hand, option (B) has a misplaced separator and an unclear structure that does not convey a clear meaning.
13. Therefore, it is evident that option (A) is the better answer, as it is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban.
14. Option (B) is incorrect due to its improper structure and lack of clarity.

Problem:
Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) cu fo'u cribe fo la .atlstan.
(B) fo fo'u cu cribe la .atlstan.

Proposed solution:
1. In order to understand why (A) cu fo'u cribe fo la .atlstan. is the correct answer, we must first break down the structure of both sentences and analyze their grammatical components.
2. In Lojban, the basic sentence structure follows the pattern of ""selbri"" (predicate) followed by ""sumti"" (arguments).
3. The word ""cu"" is used to separate the selbri from the sumti, ensuring that the sentence is grammatically correct.
4. Now, let's examine the two options: (A) cu fo'u cribe fo la .atlstan.
5. (B) fo fo'u cu cribe la .atlstan.
6. In option (A), ""cu"" is used correctly to separate the selbri ""fo'u cribe"" (meaning ""is a bear"") from the sumti ""fo la .atlstan."" (meaning ""in Atlanta"").
7. This sentence can be translated as ""There is a bear in Atlanta,"" which is a grammatically correct and coherent statement in Lojban.
8. On the other hand, option (B) has an incorrect placement of ""cu.""
9. The sentence starts with ""fo fo'u,"" which is not a valid selbri.
10. The correct selbri should be ""fo'u cribe,"" as in option (A).
11. Additionally, the placement of ""cu"" before ""cribe"" in option (B) disrupts the intended meaning of the sentence, making it ungrammatical and difficult to understand.
12. Therefore, it is clear that option (A) cu fo'u cribe fo la .atlstan. is the correct answer, as it follows the proper Lojban sentence structure and conveys a coherent meaning.
13. Option (B) fo fo'u cu cribe la .atlstan. is incorrect due to its improper use of ""cu"" and the resulting ungrammatical sentence structure.

2. (A) ni'o le ro vibna ku lidne pensi ko'u (B) ro ni'o pensi lidne vibna le ko'u ku First, let's look at (A).
3. The sentence begins with ""ni'o,"" which is a paragraph separator, indicating a new topic or idea.
4. Next, we have ""le ro vibna ku,"" which translates to ""all the females.""
5. Following that, we have ""lidne pensi,"" which means ""leading thoughts"" or ""thinking ahead.""
6. Finally, we have ""ko'u,"" which is a pronoun referring to a previously mentioned object or concept.
7. Now, let's analyze (B).
8. The sentence starts with ""ro,"" which is a quantifier meaning ""all.""
9. However, it is misplaced in this sentence, as it should be followed by a noun or pronoun, not ""ni'o.""
10. Next, we have ""ni'o pensi,"" which is an incorrect combination of the paragraph separator and the verb ""to think.""
11. The rest of the sentence, ""lidne vibna le ko'u ku,"" is similar to (A) but with a different word order.

A sentence is 'flawed' if it contains one or more claims that do not make logical sense, are untrue, seem true but misleading, or have other serious issues. Here is the problem and proposed solution:

Problem:
Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) mi'o doi meris. ba jemna
(B) mi'o doi jemna ba meris.

Proposed solution:
1. In Lojban, the structure of a sentence is crucial for conveying the intended meaning.
2. Let's break down both options to see why (A) is the better answer.
3. (A) mi'o doi meris. ba jemna (B) mi'o doi jemna ba meris.
4. In both sentences, ""mi'o"" means ""we"" and ""doi"" is a vocative marker, which is used to address someone.
5. In this case, we are addressing someone named either ""meris"" or ""jemna.""
6. Now, let's look at the second part of each sentence.
7. In (A), ""ba jemna"" means ""will compete,"" with ""ba"" indicating a future tense and ""jemna"" meaning ""compete.""
8. In (B), ""jemna ba meris"" seems to suggest that ""jemna"" is the name being addressed, and ""ba meris"" would mean ""will Meris,"" which is not a complete thought or grammatically correct in Lojban.
9. So, based on the structure and grammar of Lojban, (A) ""mi'o doi meris. ba jemna"" is the better answer, as it translates to ""We, Meris, will compete.""
10. On the other hand, (B) ""mi'o doi jemna ba meris."" does not convey a complete thought and is not grammatically correct in Lojban.
